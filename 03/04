The oscillators interact with\na strength that decays as a power law of the separation along the lattice\nlength and is normalized by a size-dependent constant. The exponent $\\alpha$ of\nthe power law is taken in the range $0 \\le \\alpha <1$. The oscillator frequency\ndistribution is symmetric about its mean (taken to be zero), and is\nnon-increasing on $[0,\\infty)$. In the continuum limit, the local density of\noscillators evolves in time following the continuity equation that expresses\nthe conservation of the number of oscillators of each frequency under the\ndynamics. This equation admits as a stationary solution the unsynchronized\nstate uniform both in phase and over the space of the lattice. We perform a\nlinear stability analysis of this state to show that when it is unstable,\ndifferent spatial Fourier modes of fluctuations have different stability\nthresholds beyond which they grow exponentially in time with rates that depend\non the Fourier modes. However, numerical simulations show that at long times,\nall the non-zero Fourier modes decay in time, while only the zero Fourier mode\n(i.e., the \"mean-field\" mode) grows in time, thereby dominating the instability\nprocess and driving the system to a synchronized state.

We propose\ntwo ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequencies\nof the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describe\nthe main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a quasi-asymptotic\nmixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations and\nthe stellar interior structure. We used period \\'echelle diagrams to emphasize\nthe detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes. The asymptotic relation for\nmixed modes is confirmed.

The identification of the\ngravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of all\nmajor peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences\nfor the true identification of \\ell = 3 modes, of \\ell = 2 mixed modes, for the\nmode widths and amplitudes, and for the \\ell = 1 rotational splittings.

We find that Ohmic damping destabilizes the\ninfinite-randomness critical point and the associated quantum Griffiths\nsingularities of the dissipationless system. The quantum dynamics of large\nmagnetic clusters freezes completely which destroys the sharp phase transition\nby smearing. The effects of sub-Ohmic dissipation are similar and also lead to\na smeared transition. In contrast, super-Ohmic damping is an irrelevant\nperturbation; the critical behavior is thus identical to that of the\ndissipationless system.

The method is based on a special property,\ncalled transplantation, which relates the eigenfunctions of the isospectral\npairs, and allows to extract the phase distributions, if the amplitude\ndistributions are known. We numerically simulate such a phase extraction\nprocedure in the presence of disorder, which is introduced both as Anderson\ndisorder and as roughness at edges. With disorder, the transplantation can no\nlonger lead to a perfect fit of the wave functions, however we show that a\nphase can still be extracted - defined as the phase that minimizes the misfit.\nInterestingly, this extracted phase coincides with (or differs negligibly from)\nthe phase of the disorder-free system, up to a certain disorder amplitude, and\na misfit of the wave functions as high as $\\sim 5%$, proving a robustness of\nthe phase extraction method against disorder. However, if the disorder is\nincreased further, the extracted phase shows a puzzle structure, no longer\ncorrelated with the phase of the disorder-free system. A discrete model is\nused, which is the natural approach for disorder analysis. We provide a proof\nthat discretization preserves isospectrality and the transplantation can be\nadapted to the discrete systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2012 07:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The value of intensity\nratio of green to red-doublet (G/R ratio) of 0.1 has been used as a benchmark\nto identify the parent molecule of oxygen lines as H$_2$O. A coupled\nchemistry-emission model is developed to study the production and loss\nmechanisms of O($^1$S) and O($^1$D) atoms and the generation of red and green\nlines in the coma of C/1996 B2 Hyakutake.\n  The G/R ratio depends not only on photochemistry, but also on the projected\narea observed for cometary coma, which is a function of the dimension of the\nslit used and geocentric distance of the comet. Calculations show that the\ncontribution of photodissociation of H$_2$O to the green (red) line emission is\n30 to 70% (60 to 90%), while CO$_2$ and CO are the next potential sources\ncontributing 25 to 50% ($<$5%).

This state now evolves with two\nHamiltonians, the final Hamiltonian following the quench and its modified\nversion which incorporates an additional term arising due to the coupling of\nthe central spin to the environment. Using a generic short-time scaling of the\ndecay rate, we establish that in the early time limit, the rate of decay of the\nLE (or the overlap between two states generated from the initial state evolving\nthrough two channels) close to the quantum critical point (QCP) of E is\nindependent of the quenching. We do also study the temporal evolution of the LE\nand establish the presence of a crossover to a situation where the quenching\nbecomes irrelevant. In the limit of large quench amplitude the non-equilibrium\ninitial condition is found to result in a drastic increase in decoherence at\nlarge times, even far away from a QCP. These generic results are verified\nanalytically as well as numerically, choosing E to be a transverse Ising chain\nwhere the transverse field is suddenly quenched.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2012 13:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 18:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-31"}

Here, we compared avalanche analyses\nperformed on different in vivo preparations during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep\nand REM sleep, using high-density electrode arrays in cat motor cortex (96\nelectrodes), monkey motor cortex and premotor cortex and human temporal cortex\n(96 electrodes) in epileptic patients. In neuronal avalanches defined from\nunits (up to 160 single units), the size of avalanches never clearly scaled as\npower-law, but rather scaled exponentially or displayed intermediate scaling.\nWe also analyzed the dynamics of local field potentials (LFPs) and in\nparticular LFP negative peaks (nLFPs) among the different electrodes (up to 96\nsites in temporal cortex or up to 128 sites in adjacent motor and pre-motor\ncortices). In this case, the avalanches defined from nLFPs displayed power-law\nscaling in double log representations, as reported previously in monkey.\nHowever, avalanche defined as positive LFP (pLFP) peaks, which are less\ndirectly related to neuronal firing, also displayed apparent power-law scaling.\nCloser examination of this scaling using more reliable cumulative distribution\nfunctions (CDF) and other rigorous statistical measures, did not confirm\npower-law scaling. The same pattern was seen for cats, monkey and human, as\nwell as for different brain states of wakefulness and sleep. We also tested\nother alternative distributions. Multiple exponential fitting yielded optimal\nfits of the avalanche dynamics with bi-exponential distributions.

However, the electro-optic tuning capability of unpatterned\ngraphene alone is still not strong enough for practical optoelectronic\napplications due to its nonresonant Drude-like behaviour.

One of the byproducts of our mathematical method is that one can get\nin few seconds, or minutes, high-precision results which normally require quite\nlong times of numerical simulation.
