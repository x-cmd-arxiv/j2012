An atomistic\nsubsemiring R of the lattice of subspaces of A, endowed with the natural\nproduct, is a subsemiring which is a closed atomistic sublattice. When R has no\nzero divisors, the set of atoms of R is endowed with a multivalued product. We\nintroduce an equivalence relation on the set of atoms such that the quotient\nset with the induced product is a monoid, called the condensation monoid. Under\nsuitable hypotheses on R, we show that this monoid is a group and the class of\nk1_A is the set of atoms of a subalgebra of A called the focal subalgebra. This\nconstruction can be iterated to obtain higher condensation groups and focal\nsubalgebras. We apply these results to G-algebras for G a group; in particular,\nwe use them to define new invariants for finite-dimensional irreducible\nprojective representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2012 19:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

This perspective is very different than the more statistical perspective\nadopted by statisticians, scientific computers, machine learners, and other who\nwork on what may be broadly termed statistical data analysis. In this article,\nI will address fundamental aspects of this algorithmic-statistical disconnect,\nwith an eye to bridging the gap between these two very different approaches. A\nconcept that lies at the heart of this disconnect is that of statistical\nregularization, a notion that has to do with how robust is the output of an\nalgorithm to the noise properties of the input data. Although it is nearly\ncompletely absent from computer science, which historically has taken the input\ndata as given and modeled algorithms discretely, regularization in one form or\nanother is central to nearly every application domain that applies algorithms\nto noisy data. By using several case studies, I will illustrate, both\ntheoretically and empirically, the nonobvious fact that approximate\ncomputation, in and of itself, can implicitly lead to statistical\nregularization. This and other recent work suggests that, by exploiting in a\nmore principled way the statistical properties implicit in worst-case\nalgorithms, one can in many cases satisfy the bicriteria of having algorithms\nthat are scalable to very large-scale databases and that also have good\ninferential or predictive properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2012 23:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

By applying the transformation of Cook and Shankland we find that\nthe micromotion can be represented by two periodically oscillating operators.\nIn order to investigate the effect of the micromotion on the dynamics of a\ntrapped atom-ion system, we calculate (i) the coupling strengths of the\nmicromotion operators by numerical integration and (ii) the quasienergies of\nthe system by applying the Floquet formalism, a useful framework for studying\nperiodic systems. It turns out that the micromotion is not negligible when the\ndistance between the atom and the ion traps is shorter than a characteristic\ndistance. Within this range the energy diagram of the system changes remarkably\nwhen the micromotion is taken into account, which leads to undesirable\nconsequences for applications that are based on an adiabatic process of the\ntrapped atom-ion system.

With this\nnovel perspective and Bell's theorem, we argue that special relativity, instead\nof quantum theory, should be radically reformulated to resolve inconsistencies\nbetween the two theories. A new theory of relativistic quantum mechanics is\nformulated upon this novel perspective. This new relativistic quantum mechanics\nis free from such anomalies as the negative probability density, the\nnegative-energy states, Zitterbewegung, and the Klein paradox deep-rooted in\nthe current relativistic quantum mechanics. Moreover, a remarkable result is\nfound that a particle can not be confined within an infinite square well of\nwidth less than half of the Compton wavelength. As implications in nuclear\nphysics, there is a lower bound on the size of atomic nucleus. Neither an\nelectron, nor a positron, can be confined inside the nucleus by whatever\ninteraction.\n  Furthermore, we argue that the postulates of non-relativistic quantum\nstatistics fulfill the principle of relativity, as extended to the relativistic\nrealm. A new theory of relativistic quantum statistics is formulated such that\nthe probability distribution functions are the same as the three well-known\nprobability distribution functions in non-relativistic quantum statistics. A\nrelativistic speed distribution of a dilute gas is then derived by the new\nrelativistic quantum statistics and the new relativistic quantum mechanics.\nThis relativistic speed distribution reduces to Maxwell speed distribution in\nthe low temperature region. Yet, this relativistic speed distribution differs\nremarkably from J\\\"uttner speed distribution in the high temperature region.\nAlso, thermal properties of a dilute gas are studied by the new relativistic\nquantum statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 02:16:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 09:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 01:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 08:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 02:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-28"}

We focus\non the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc\nis maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the\ndriver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead\nbe maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is\nself-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.\nHowever, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be\nhard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 03:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 22:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In semi-analytic work on both problems it has been\nuseful to presume large scale symmetries, necessarily resulting in mean field\ntheories. MHD turbulence makes the underlying systems locally asymmetric and\nnonlinear. Synergy between theory and simulations should aim for the\ndevelopment of practical mean field models that capture essential physics and\ncan be used for observational modeling. Mean field dynamo (MFD) theory and\nalpha-viscosity accretion theory exemplify such ongoing pursuits. 21st century\nMFD theory has more nonlinear predictive power compared to 20th century MFD\ntheory, whereas accretion theory is still in a 20th century state. In fact,\ninsights from MFD theory are applicable to accretion theory and the two are\nartificially separated pieces of what should be a single theory. I discuss\npieces of progress that provide clues toward a unified theory. A key concept is\nthat large scale magnetic fields can be sustained via local or global magnetic\nhelicity fluxes or via relaxation of small scale magnetic fluctuations, without\nthe kinetic helicity driver of 20th century textbooks. These concepts may help\nexplain the formation of large scale fields that supply non-local angular\nmomentum transport via coronae and jets in a unified theory of accretion and\ndynamos. In diagnosing the role of helicities and helicity fluxes in disk\nsimulations, each disk hemisphere should be studied separately to avoid being\nmisled by cancelation that occurs as a result of reflection asymmetry. The\nfraction of helical field energy in disks is expected to be small compared to\nthe total field in each hemisphere as a result of shear, but can still be\nessential for large scale dynamo action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 07:16:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 08:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 06:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Introduction In Computability Theory (Recursion\nTheory) in the first step we wish to recognize the sets which could be\nenumerated by Turing machines (equivalently, algorithms) and in the next step\nwe will compare these sets by some reasonable order (Like Turing degree). Also\nsometimes with some extra information (Oracles) a class of non c.e. sets show\nthe same behavior as c.e. sets (Post hierarchy and related theorems). Here we\ntry another approach: \"Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to recognize how\nmuch this set might be covered by a c.e. set?\" Although in some sense this\napproach could be seen in some definitions of Recursion Theory, but at the best\nof our knowledge it didn't considered as an approach yet, even though it is\nable to shed a light on some subjects of Computability of sets. Defining this\napproach is not quite straightforward and there are some obstacles to define\nthem. To overcome these difficulties we modify the definitions. We have an\nalternative problem here when we consider recursive sets and not c.e. sets. In\nthis case, the problem would be: \"Let A be an arbitrary set and we wish to know\nthat how much this set might be covered by a recursive Set?\" Here, we try the\nfirst definition and the first problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 09:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

This framework has also been used for discrimination\ntasks such as image classification. To achieve better performances of\nclassification, experts develop several methods to learn a discriminative\ndictionary in a supervised manner. However, another issue is that when the data\nbecome extremely large in scale, these methods will be no longer effective as\nthey are all batch-oriented approaches. For this reason, we propose a novel\nonline algorithm for discriminative dictionary learning, dubbed \\textbf{ODDL}\nin this paper. First, we introduce a linear classifier into the conventional\ndictionary learning formulation and derive a discriminative dictionary learning\nproblem. Then, we exploit an online algorithm to solve the derived problem.\nUnlike the most existing approaches which update dictionary and classifier\nalternately via iteratively solving sub-problems, our approach directly\nexplores them jointly. Meanwhile, it can largely shorten the runtime for\ntraining and is also particularly suitable for large-scale classification\nissues.

We find that\nthe redshift space distortion on the shape of voids statistically increases the\nellipticities of voids, and leaves a prominent feature on the ellipticity PDF\nas a substantial reduction in the probability of having voids with small\nellipticity. The location of this characteristic cutoff of the ellipticity PDF\nis an explicit function of the logarithmic growth rate, and it can be used as a\nprobe of cosmology once the radial density profile of voids is better\nunderstood. However, the biggest limiting factor for the use of ellipticity PDF\nas a probe of cosmology lies in the Poisson noise from a small number of\ngalaxies to define the shape of a given void. This Poisson noise creates a\nsignificant contamination of the resulting ellipticity PDF so that the shape of\nthe original PDF is almost washed-out. Nevertheless, there is a way to overcome\nthe Poisson noise via the Alcock Paczynski test on the shape of stacked voids.\nIn redshift space, since the void is elongated toward the line of sight, the\nstacked void has non-zero ellipticity, which can be a tell-tale of the\nlogarithmic growth rate. Although some useful information of void ellipticity\nwill be lost by stacking, in this way, we can see the effect of redshift space\ndistortion as a source of anisotropy in the stacked void ellipticity. We think\nthat the stacking analysis of the voids in redshift space is potentially a\npowerful tool to probe the cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 11:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

We establish that the vortex dipole is set in steady\nstate rotational motion. The frequency of rotation is due to two independent\nforces: the interaction between the two vortices and the external magnetic\nfield. The nonzero skyrmion number of the dipole is responsible for both forces\ngiving rise to rotational dynamics. The spin-torque acts to stabilize the\nvortex dipole motion at a definite vortex-antivortex separation distance.

When the particle distribution is irregular and the tree structure\nis adaptive, load-balancing becomes a non-trivial question. A common strategy\nfor load-balancing FMMs is to use the work load from the previous step as\nweights to statically repartition the next step. The authors discuss in the\npaper another approach based on data-driven execution to efficiently tackle\nthis challenging load-balancing problem. The core idea consists of breaking the\nmost time-consuming stages of the FMMs into smaller tasks. The algorithm can\nthen be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where nodes represent\ntasks, and edges represent dependencies among them. The execution of the\nalgorithm is performed by asynchronously scheduling the tasks using the QUARK\nruntime environment, in a way such that data dependencies are not violated for\nnumerical correctness purposes. This asynchronous scheduling results in an\nout-of-order execution. The performance results of the data-driven FMM\nexecution outperform the previous strategy and show linear speedup on a\nquad-socket quad-core Intel Xeon system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 12:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

The\ndetection of this new species increased the list of complex organic molecules\ndetected in the interstellar medium (ISM) and adds another level to the\nchemical complexity present in space. Besides, this kind of organic molecule is\nimportant because it is directly linked to the origin of life. For many years,\nastronomers have been struggling to understand the origin of this high chemical\ncomplexity in the ISM. The study of deuteration may provide crucial hints. In\nthis context, we have measured the spectra of deuterated isotopologues of\nglycolaldehyde in the laboratory: the three monodeuterated ones (CH2OD-CHO,\nCHDOH-CHO and CH2OH-CDO) and one dideuterated derivative (CHDOH-CDO) in the\nground vibrational state. Previous laboratory work on the D-isotopologues of\nglycolaldehyde was restricted to less than 26 GHz. We used a solidstate\nsubmillimeter-wave spectrometer in Lille with an accuracy for isolated lines\nbetter than 30 kHz to acquire new spectroscopic data between 150 and 630 GHz\nand employed the ASFIT and SPCAT programs for analysis. We measured around 900\nnew lines for each isotopologue and determined spectroscopic parameters. This\nallows an accurate prediction in the ALMA range up to 850 GHz. This treatment\nmeets the needs for a first astrophysical research, for which we provide an\nappropriate set of predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 13:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

Autocalibration\nenables the estimation of the camera parameters without using a calibration\ndevice, but by enforcing simple constraints on the camera parameters. In the\nabsence of information about the internal camera parameters such as the focal\nlength and the principal point, the knowledge of the camera pixel shape is\nusually the only available constraint. Given a projective reconstruction of a\nrigid scene, we address the problem of the autocalibration of a minimal set of\ncameras with known pixel shape and otherwise arbitrarily varying intrinsic and\nextrinsic parameters. We propose an algorithm that only requires 5 cameras (the\ntheoretical minimum), thus halving the number of cameras required by previous\nalgorithms based on the same constraint.

In\nthe bosonic models we show the existence of an exotic first/second order\ntransition from a phase with a well defined background geometry (the fuzzy\nsphere) to a phase with commuting matrices with no geometry in the sense of\nConnes. At the transition point the sphere expands abruptly to infinite size\nthen it evaporates as we increase the temperature (the gauge coupling\nconstant). The transition looks first order due to the discontinuity in the\naction whereas it looks second order due to the divergent peak in the specific\nheat. The fuzzy sphere is stable for the supersymmetric models in the sense\nthat the bosonic phase transition is turned into a very slow crossover\ntransition. The transition point is found to scale to zero with N. We\nconjecture that the transition from the background sphere to the phase of\ncommuting matrices is associated with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The\neigenvalues distribution of any of the bosonic matrices in the matrix phase is\nfound to be given by a non-polynomial law obtained from the fact that the joint\nprobability distribution of the four matrices is uniform inside a solid ball\nwith radius R. The eigenvalues of the gauge field on the background geometry\nare also found to be distributed according to this non-polynomial law.

We consider frictionless\nflat-ended and spherical sinusoidally-driven indentation tests utilizing\ndisplacement-controlled loading protocol. Articular cartilage tissue is modeled\nas a viscoelastic material with a time-independent Poisson's ratio. We study\nthe dynamic indentation stiffness with the aim of formulating criteria for\nevaluation the quality of articular cartilage in order to be able to\ndiscriminate its degenerative state. In particular, evaluating the dynamic\nindentation stiffness at the turning point of the flat-ended indentation test,\nwe introduce the so-called incomplete storage modulus. Considering the time\ndifference between the time moments when the dynamic stiffness vanishes\n(contact force reaches its maximum) and the dynamic stiffness becomes infinite\n(indenter displacement reaches its maximum), we introduce the so-called\nincomplete loss angle. Analogous quantities can be introduced in the spherical\nsinusoidally-driven indentation test, however, to account for the thickness\neffect, a special approach is required. We apply an asymptotic modeling\napproach for analyzing and interpreting the results of the dynamic spherical\nindentation test in terms of the geometrical parameter of the indenter and\nviscoelastic characteristics of the material. Some implications to\nnon-destructive indentation diagnostics of cartilage degeneration are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 13:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this\nnote, the authors propose an essential, clear and rigorous construction of R\nfrom the stucture Q+ of positive rational numbers by the key notion of initial\nsegment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 15:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-07"}

Cauchy, on the other hand, has\nproved that there do not exist convex polyhedra that are deformable under the\nprescribed conditions. In this Memoir I propose to extend the above mentioned\nresult, by resolving the problem of Mr. Stephanos in general for octahedra of\ntriangular facets. Following Cauchy's theorem, all the octahedra which I shall\nestablish as deformable will be of necessity concave by virtue of the fact that\nthey possess reentrant dihedrals or, in fact, facets that intercross, in the\nmanner of facets of polyhedra in higher dimensional spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2012 23:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-07"}

The frequency spectrum of CoRoT ID\n105733033 clearly consists of two distinct ranges, which are typical of gamma\nDoradus and delta Scuti pulsation. Focus was placed on the identification of\nlinear combinations and frequencies due to the coupling between gamma Doradus\nand delta Scuti modes.\n  We detect 198 gamma Doradus type frequencies in the range [0.25;4]c/d, of\nwhich 180 are not combination frequencies, and 24 of them are separated by a\nconstant period-interval Delta P=0.03074d. According to the asymptotic theory,\nthese 24 frequencies correspond to a series of g-modes of the same ell-degree\nand different radial orders n. We also detect 246 delta Scuti type frequencies\nin the range [10.1;63.4]c/d. The dominant frequency F=12.6759c/d was identified\nas the fundamental radial mode. Our most noteworthy result is that all the main\ngamma Doradus frequencies f_i are also detected in the delta Scuti domain as F\n+- f_i with four times smaller amplitudes. Once these frequencies were removed,\nonly 59 can be considered as individual delta Scuti frequencies.\n  A coupling between g- and p-modes is proposed to be a tool for detecting\ng-modes in the Sun, but this coupling has never yet been observed. Our present\nstudy may be valuable input to theoretical studies, addressing the mutual\ninfluence of g- and p-mode cavities and the deviation from classical theory.\nFurthermore, we identify a sequence of g-modes belonging to the same ell but\nwith consecutive orders n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 09:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
