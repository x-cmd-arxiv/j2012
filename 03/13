In this study we present a newly developed\ndeep-focus time-distance measurement scheme which is able to detect strong\nemerging flux events in the deep solar interior, before the flux becomes\nvisible on the surface. We discuss in detail the differences between our method\nand previous methods, and demonstrate step-by-step how the signal-to-noise\n(S/N) ratio is increased. The method is based on detection of perturbations in\nacoustic phase travel times determined from cross-covariances of solar\noscillations observed on the surface. We detect strong acoustic travel-time\nreductions of an order of 12 - 16 seconds at a depth of 42 - 75 Mm. These\nacoustic anomalies are detected 1 - 2 days before high peaks in the\nphotospheric magnetic flux rate implying that the average emerging speed is 0.3\n- 0.6 km/s. The results of this work contribute to our understanding of solar\nmagnetism and benefit space weather forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 16:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-13"}

IFU instrument designs are complex and spectral images have\ntypically highly condensed formats, therefore presenting challenges for the IFU\ndata reduction pipelines. In the case of the VLT VIMOS-IFU, a fringe-like\npattern affecting the spectra well into the optical and blue wavelength regime\nas well as artificial intensity variations, require additional reduction steps\nbeyond standard pipeline processing. In this research note we propose an\nempirical method for the removal of the fringe-like pattern in the spectral\ndomain and the intensity variations in the imaging domain. We also demonstrate\nthe potential consequences for data analysis if the effects are not corrected.\nHere we use the example of deriving stellar velocity, velocity dispersion and\nabsorption line-strength maps for early-type galaxies. We derive for each\nspectrum, reduced by the ESO standard VIMOS pipeline, a correction-spectrum by\nusing the median of the eight surrounding spectra as a proxy for the\nunaffected, underlying spectrum. This method relies on the fact that our\nscience targets (nearby ETGs) cover the complete FoV of the VIMOS-IFU with\nslowly varying spectral properties and that the exact shape of the fringe-like\npattern is nearly independent and highly variable between neighboring spatial\npositions. We find that the proposed correction methods for the removal of the\nfringe-like pattern and the intensity variations in VIMOS-IFU data-cubes are\nsuitable to allow for meaningful data analysis in our sample of nearby\nearly-type galaxies.

This suggests that supergranules are advected by flows at depths\nequal to their wavelengths and thus can be used to probe flows at those depths.\nThe supergranule rotation profiles show that the surface shear layer, through\nwhich the rotation rate increases inward, extends to depths of ~50 Mm and to\nlatitudes of at least 70 degrees. Typical supergranules are well observed at\nhigh latitudes and have a range of sizes that extend to greater depths than\nthose typically available for measuring subsurface flows with local\nhelioseismology.

At these early times, the Universe was dense and hot enough\nthat complete thermal equilibrium between baryonic matter (electrons and ions)\nand photons could be established. Any perturbation away from the blackbody\nspectrum was suppressed exponentially. New physics, for example annihilation\nand decay of dark matter, can add energy and photons to CMB at redshifts z>10^5\nand result in a Bose-Einstein spectrum with a non-zero chemical potential\n($\\mu$). Precise evolution of the CMB spectrum around the critical redshift of\nz~2x10^6 is required in order to calculate the $\\mu$-type spectral distortion\nand constrain the underlying new physics. Although numerical calculation of\nimportant processes involved (double Compton process, comptonization and\nbremsstrahlung) is not difficult, analytic solutions are much faster and easier\nto calculate and provide valuable physical insights. We provide precise (better\nthan 1%) analytic solutions for the decay of $\\mu$, created at an earlier\nepoch, including all three processes, double Compton, Compton scattering on\nthermal electrons and bremsstrahlung in the limit of small distortions.

We find that\nall four planets are unexpectedly bright at 3.3 microns compared to the\nequilibrium chemistry models used for field brown dwarfs, which predict that\nplanets should be faint at 3.3 microns due to CH4 opacity. We attempt to model\nthe planets with thick-cloudy, non-equilibrium chemistry atmospheres, but find\nthat removing CH4 to fit the 3.3 micron photometry increases the predicted L'\n(3.8 microns) flux enough that it is inconsistent with observations. In an\neffort to fit the SED of the HR 8799 planets, we construct mixtures of cloudy\natmospheres, which are intended to represent planets covered by clouds of\nvarying opacity. In this scenario, regions with low opacity look hot and\nbright, while regions with high opacity look faint, similar to the patchy cloud\nstructures on Jupiter and L/T transition brown-dwarfs. Our mixed cloud models\nreproduce all of the available data, but self-consistent models are still\nnecessary to demonstrate their viability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 22:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Using two-point statistics in\nprojection, we define the galaxy bias function, b_g(r_p), and the galaxy-dark\nmatter cross-correlation function, R_{gm}(r_p), where r_p is the projected\ndistance. We use the analytical halo model to predict how the scale dependence\nof b_g and R_{gm}, over the range 0.1 Mpc/h < r_p < 30 Mpc/h, depends on the\nnon-linearity and stochasticity in halo occupation models. In particular we\nquantify the effect due to the presence of central galaxies, the assumption for\nthe radial distribution of satellite galaxies, the richness of the halo, and\nthe Poisson character of the probability to have a certain number of satellite\ngalaxies in a halo of a certain mass. Overall, brighter galaxies reveal a\nstronger scale dependence, and out to a larger radius. In real-space, we find\nthat galaxy bias becomes scale independent, with R_{gm} = 1, for radii r > 1 -\n5 Mpc/h, depending on luminosity. However, galaxy bias is scale-dependent out\nto much larger radii when one uses the projected quantities defined in this\npaper. These projected bias functions have the advantage that they are more\neasily accessible observationally and that their scale dependence carries a\nwealth of information regarding the properties of galaxy biasing. To\nobservationally constrain the parameters of the halo occupation statistics and\nto unveil the origin of galaxy biasing we propose the use of the bias function\nGamma_{gm}(r_p)=b_g(r_p)/R_{gm}(r_p). This function is obtained via a\ncombination of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, and it can be\nmeasured using existing and forthcoming imaging and spectroscopic galaxy\nsurveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Even more remarkably, for\nstrong surface disorder a Dirac cone reappears, as new weakly disordered\n\"surface\" states emerge in the sample beneath the disordered surface layer,\nwhich can be understood in terms of an interface between a topological and an\nAnderson insulator. Together, this demonstrates the drastic effect of disorder\non topological surface states, which cannot be captured within effective\ntwo-dimensional models for the surface states alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 20:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-30"}

We thus observed the nebula surrounding RS Pup using the\npolarimetric imaging mode of the VLT/FORS instrument, and obtained a map of the\ndegree and position angle of linear polarization. From our FORS observations,\nwe derive a 3D map of the distribution of the dust, whose overall geometry is\nan irregular and thin layer. The nebula does not present a well-defined\nsymmetry. Using a simple model, we derive a total dust mass of M(dust) = 2.9\n+/- 0.9 Msun for the dust within 1.8 arcmin of the Cepheid.

The reason is in the divergent\nnature of amplification factors near fold caustics increasingly sensitive to\nsmall spatial size details. Higher-order disc images produced by strong light\nbending around the black hole may affect the amplification curves, making a\ncontribution of up to several percent near maximum amplification. In accordance\nwith theoretical predictions, some of the observed high-amplification events\npossess fine structure. Here we consider three putative caustic crossing\nevents, one by SBS1520+530 and two events for individual images of the\nEinstein's cross (QSO J2237+0305). Using relativistic disc models allows to\nimprove the fits, but the required inclinations are high, about 70deg or\nlarger. Such high inclinations apparently contradict the absence of any strong\nabsorption that is likely to arise if a disc is observed edge-on through a dust\ntorus. Still, the high inclinations are required only for the central parts of\nthe disc, that allows the disc itself to be initially tilted by 60-90deg with\nrespect to the black hole and aligned toward the black hole equatorial plane\nnear the last stable orbit radius. For SBS1520+530, an alternative explanation\nfor the observed amplification curve is a superposition of two subsequent fold\ncaustic crossings. While relativistic disc models favour black hole masses\n~10^10 solar (several times higher than the virial estimates) or small\nEddington ratios, this model is consistent with the observed distribution of\ngalaxies over peculiar velocities only if the black hole mass is about 3 10^8\nsolar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 21:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 08:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

These\nspectral distortions depend on the shape and amplitude of the primordial power\nspectrum at wavenumbers k < 10^4 Mpc^{-1}. Here we study constraints on the\nprimordial power spectrum derived from COBE/FIRAS and forecasted for PIXIE. We\nshow that measurements of mu and y impose strong bounds on the integrated\nsmall-scale power, and we demonstrate how to compute these constraints using\nk-space window functions that account for the effects of thermalization and\ndissipation physics. We show that COBE/FIRAS places a robust upper limit on the\namplitude of the small-scale power spectrum. This limit is about three orders\nof magnitude stronger than the one derived from primordial black holes in the\nsame scale range. Furthermore, this limit could be improved by another three\norders of magnitude with PIXIE, potentially opening up a new window to early\nUniverse physics. To illustrate the power of these constraints, we consider\nseveral generic models for the small-scale power spectrum predicted by\ndifferent inflation scenarios, including running-mass inflation models and\ninflation scenarios with episodes of particle production. PIXIE could place\nvery tight constraints on these scenarios, potentially even ruling out\nrunning-mass inflation models if no distortion is detected. We also show that\ninflation models with sub-Planckian field excursion that generate detectable\ntensor perturbations should simultaneously produce a large CMB spectral\ndistortion, a link that could potentially be established by PIXIE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 00:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

If the air pressure is lowered, droplet ejection\nis suppressed not only during thin-sheet formation but for prompt splashing as\nwell. The threshold pressure depends on impact velocity, liquid viscosity and\nsurface roughness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 05:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 22:25:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 04:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Observations of PSR J1622-4950 with Chandra (in 2007 and\n2009) and XMM (in 2011) show that the X-ray flux of PSR J1622-4950 has\ndecreased by a factor of ~50 over 3.7 years, decaying exponentially with a\ncharacteristic time of 360 +/- 11 days. This behavior identifies PSR J1622-4950\nas a possible addition to the small class of transient magnetars. The X-ray\ndecay likely indicates that PSR J1622-4950 is recovering from an X-ray outburst\nthat occurred earlier in 2007, before the 2007 Chandra observations.\nObservations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array show strong radio\nvariability, including a possible radio flaring event at least one and a half\nyears after the 2007 X-ray outburst that may be a direct result of this X-ray\nevent. Radio observations with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope\nreveal that PSR J1622-4950 is 8' southeast of a diffuse radio arc, G333.9+0.0,\nwhich appears non-thermal in nature and which could possibly be a previously\nundiscovered supernova remnant. If G333.9+0.0 is a supernova remnant then the\nestimates of its size and age, combined with the close proximity and reasonable\nimplied velocity of PSR J1622-4950, suggests that these two objects could be\nphysically associated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 05:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and density functional theory provide\ninsight into the charge transfer and hybridization mechanisms of TMPc as a\nfunction of increasing occupancy of the 3d metal states. We show that all four\nTMPc receive approximately one electron from the substrate. Charge transfer\noccurs from the substrate to the molecules, inducing a charge reorganization in\nFePc and CoPc, while adding one electron to ligand \\pi-orbitals in NiPc and\nCuPc. This has opposite consequences on the molecular magnetic moment: in FePc\nand CoPc the interaction with the substrate tends to reduce the TM spin,\nwhereas in NiPc and CuPc an additional spin is induced on the aromatic Pc\nligand, leaving the TM spin unperturbed. In CuPc, the presence of both TM and\nligand spins leads to a triplet ground state arising from intramolecular\nexchange coupling between d and \\pi electrons. In FePc and CoPc the magnetic\nmoment of C and N atoms is antiparallel to that of the TM. The different\ncharacter and symmetry of the frontier orbitals in the TMPc series leads to\nvarying degrees of hybridization and correlation effects, ranging from the\nmixed-valence (FePc, CoPc) to the Kondo regime (NiPc, CuPc).

The four ssDNA strands that\nare attached via alkythiolate [-S (CH2)6-] linker molecule to the free amine\ngroups on the surface of the PAMAM dendrimers observed to undergo a rapid\nconformational change during the 25 ns long simulation period.

As G4 dendrimer contains relatively more\npositive charge than G3 dendrimer, we observe extensive wrapping of ssDNAs on\nthe G4 dendrimer.

The observed\npolarization is lower than the Milne value in a non-magnetized atmosphere. We\nhypothesize that the polarized radiation escapes from optically thick\nmagnetized accretion discs and is weakened by the Faraday rotation effect. This\neffect is able to explain both the value of the polarization and the position\nangle. We estimate the required magnetic field in the broad line region by\nusing simple asymptotic analytical formulas for Milne's problem in magnetized\natmosphere, which take into account the last scattering of radiation before\nescaping from the accretion disc. The polarization of a broad spectral line\nescaping from disc is described by the same mechanism. The characteristic\nfeatures of polarization of a broad line is the minimum of the degree of\npolarization in the center of the line and continuous rotation of the position\nangle from one wing to another. These effects can be explained by existence of\nclouds in the left (velocity is directed to an observer) and the right\n(velocity is directed from an observer) parts of the orbit in a rotating\nkeplerian magnetized accretion disc. The base of explanation is existence of\nazimuthal magnetic field in the orbit. The existence of normal component of\nmagnetic field makes the picture of polarization asymmetric. The existence of\nclouds in left and right parts of the orbit with different emissions also give\nthe contribution in asymmetry effect. Assuming a power-law dependence of the\nmagnetic field inside the disc, we obtain the estimate of the magnetic field\nstrength at first stable orbit near the central SMBH for a number of AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 11:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The global description is a realization of the sculpting mechanism of\ngauging (arXiv:1107.3255) and it is associated to particular deformation of\nfibrations. The supermembrane with central charges may be formulated in terms\nof sections on symplectic torus bundles with SL(2,Z) monodromy. This global\nformulation corresponds to the gauging of the abelian subgroups of SL(2,Z)\nassociated to monodromies acting on the target torus.

Specifically, we consider\nfully-connected topologies with independently fading channels (which can model\ncellular networks) in which flows with short-term deadline constraints and\nlong-term drop rate requirements are served. To that end, we first characterize\nthe maximal set of satisfiable arrival processes for this system and, then,\npropose a Fast-CSMA (FCSMA) policy that is shown to be optimal in supporting\nany real-time traffic that is within the maximal satisfiable set. These\ntheoretical results are further validated through simulations to demonstrate\nthe relative efficiency of the FCSMA policy compared to some of the existing\nCSMA-based algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 15:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-06"}
