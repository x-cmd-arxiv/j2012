The side frequencies are related to the spring tidal period of\nJupiter and Saturn (9.93 yr) and to the tidal sidereal period of Jupiter (11.86\nyr). A simplified harmonic constituent model based on the above two planetary\ntidal frequencies and on the exact dates of Jupiter and Saturn planetary tidal\nphases, plus a theoretically deduced 10.87-year central cycle reveals complex\nquasi-periodic interference/beat patterns at about 115, 61 and 130 years, plus\na quasi-millennial large beat cycle around 983 years. We show that equivalent\nsynchronized cycles are found in cosmogenic records used to reconstruct solar\nactivity and in proxy climate records throughout the Holocene. The\nquasi-secular beat oscillations hindcast reasonably well the known prolonged\nperiods of low solar activity during the last millennium known as Oort, Wolf,\nSporer, Maunder and Dalton minima, as well as 17 115-year long oscillations\nfound in temperature reconstructions during the last 2000 years. The millennial\nthree-frequency beat cycle hindcasts equivalent solar and climate cycles for\n12,000 years. Prolonged solar minima in 1900-1920 and 1960-1980, the secular\nsolar maxima around 1870-1890, 1940-1950 and 1995-2005, and a secular upward\ntrending during the 20th century is recovered: this modulated trending agrees\nwell with some solar proxy model, with the ACRIM TSI satellite composite and\nwith the global surface temperature modulation since 1850. The model forecasts\na new prolonged solar grand minimum during 2020-2045, which would be produced\nby the minima of both the 61 and 115-year reconstructed cycles. Solar and\nclimate oscillations are linked to planetary motion and, furthermore, their\ntiming can be reasonably hindcast and forecast for decades, centuries and\nmillennia. The critique by Smythe and Eddy (1977) is rebutted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 16:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-20"}

Bollob\\'as and Erd\\H{o}s (1990) conjectured that the expected final\nnumber of edges has order $n^{3/2}$, motivated by the study of the Ramsey\nnumber $R(3,t)$.

We review the recent observational results on the hot gas in galaxy\ngroups. The first part of the paper is on the scaling relations, including\nX-ray luminosity, entropy, gas fraction, baryon fraction and metal abundance.\nCompared to clusters, groups have a lower fraction of hot gas around the center\n(e.g., r < r_2500), but may have a comparable gas fraction at large radii\n(e.g., r_2500 < r < r_500). Better constraints on the group gas and baryon\nfractions require sample studies with different selection functions and deep\nobservations at r > r_500 regions. The hot gas in groups is also iron poor at\nlarge radii (0.3 r_500 - 0.7 r_500). The iron content of the hot gas within the\ncentral regions (r < 0.3 r_500) correlates with the group mass, in contrast to\nthe trend of the stellar mass fraction.

The recently discovered\nGalactic halo star SDSS J102915+172927 (Caffau et al. 2011) has a mass less\nthan 0.8 Msun and a metallicity of Z = 4.5 10^{-5} Zsun. We investigate the\norigin and properties of this star by reconstructing the physical conditions in\nits birth cloud. We show that the observed elemental abundance trend of SDSS\nJ102915+172927 can be well fitted by the yields of core-collapse supernovae\nwith metal-free progenitors of 20 Msun and 35 Msun. Using these selected\nsupernova explosion models, we compute the corresponding dust yields and the\nresulting dust depletion factor taking into account the partial destruction by\nthe supernova reverse shock. We then follow the collapse and fragmentation of a\nstar forming cloud enriched by the products of these SN explosions at the\nobserved metallicity of SDSS J102915+172927. We find that [0.05 - 0.1] Msun\nmass fragments, which then lead to the formation of low-mass stars, can occur\nprovided that the mass fraction of dust grains in the birth cloud exceeds 0.01\nof the total mass of metals and dust. This, in turn, requires that at least 0.4\nMsun of dust condense in the first supernovae, allowing for moderate\ndestruction by the reverse shock. If dust formation in the first supernovae is\nless efficient or strong dust destruction does occur, the thermal evolution of\nthe SDSS J102915+172927 birth cloud is dominated by molecular cooling, and only\n> 8 Msun fragments can form. We conclude that the observed properties of SDSS\nJ102915+172927 support the suggestion that dust must have condensed in the\nejecta of the first supernovae and played a fundamental role in the formation\nof the first low-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 20:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This finding can be understood if one assumes that the conversion\nfactor between CO luminosity and H2 mass is much larger in these low\nmetallicity systems than in nearby molecular clouds. However, it is unclear\nwhether this is the only factor at work, or whether the star formation rate of\nthe clouds is directly sensitive to the metallicity of the gas.\n  To investigate this, we have performed numerical simulations of the coupled\ndynamical, chemical and thermal evolution of model clouds with metallicities\nranging from 0.01 Z_solar to Z_solar. We find that the star formation rate in\nour model clouds has little sensitivity to the metallicity. Reducing the\nmetallicity of the gas by two orders of magnitude delays the onset of star\nformation in the clouds by no more than a cloud free-fall time and reduces the\ntime-averaged star formation rate by at most a factor of two. On the other\nhand, the chemical state of the clouds is highly sensitive to the metallicity,\nand at the lowest metallicities, the clouds are completely dominated by atomic\ngas. Our results confirm that the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in these systems\ndepends strongly on the metallicity, but also show that the precise value is\nhighly time-dependent, as the integrated CO luminosity of the most metal-poor\nclouds is dominated by emission from short-lived gravitationally collapsing\nregions. Finally, we find evidence that the star formation rate per unit H2\nmass increases with decreasing metallicity, owing to the much smaller H2\nfractions present in our low metallicity clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 20:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 14:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The correlations between the central values of the\nline-strength indices and velocity dispersion are consistent to those known for\nearly-type galaxies and bulges of high surface-brightness galaxies. The age,\nmetallicity, and alpha/Fe enhancement of the stellar populations in the\nbulge-dominated region are obtained using stellar population models with\nvariable element abundance ratios. Almost all the sample bulges are\ncharacterized by a young stellar population, on-going star formation, and a\nsolar alpha/Fe enhancement. Their metallicity spans from high to sub-solar\nvalues. No significant gradient in age and alpha/Fe enhancement is measured,\nwhereas only in a few cases a negative metallicity gradient is found. These\nproperties suggest that a pure dissipative collapse is not able to explain\nformation of all the sample bulges and that other phenomena, like mergers or\nacquisition events, need to be invoked. Such a picture is also supported by the\nlack of a correlation between the central value and gradient of the metallicity\nin bulges with very low metallicity. The stellar populations of the bulges\nhosted by low surface-brightness discs share many properties with those of high\nsurface-brightness galaxies. Therefore, they are likely to have common\nformation scenarios and evolution histories.

For parallel\ngraphene pairs separated by small gaps, the dispersion relation of the surface\nplasmon splits into two branches, one with a symmetric and the other with an\nantisymmetric magnetic field across the gap. For the symmetric (magnetic field)\nbranch, the confinement may be improved at reduced absorption loss over a wide\nspectrum, unlike conventional SP modes supported on metallic surfaces that are\nsubjected to the trade-off between loss and confinement. This symmetric mode\nbecomes strongly suppressed for very small separations however.

However when reduced to a\ntwo dimensional (2D) isotropic problem, the resulting model becomes non-chiral.\nTherefore, influence of the chiral effect cannot be properly characterized by\nexisting theories for 2D chiral solids. To circumvent this difficulty, based on\nreinterpretation of isotropic tensors in a 2D case, we propose a continuum\ntheory to model the chiral effect for 2D isotropic chiral solids. A single\nmaterial parameter related to chirality is introduced to characterize the\ncoupling between the bulk deformation and the internal rotation which is a\nfundamental feature of 2D chiral solids. Coherently, the proposed continuum\ntheory is also derived for a triangular chiral lattice from a homogenization\nprocedure, from which the effective material constants of the lattice are\nanalytically determined. The unique behavior in the chiral lattice is\ndemonstrated through the analyses of a static tension problem and a plane wave\npropagation problem. The results, which cannot be predicted by the non-chiral\nmodel, are validated by the exact solution of the discrete model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 04:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A review of our current knowledge of the\ndensity of small bodies is presented here. Intrinsic physical properties of\nsmall bodies are sought by searching for relationships between the dynamical\nand taxonomic classes, size, and density. Mass and volume estimates for 287\nsmall bodies are collected from the literature. The accuracy and biases\naffecting the methods used to estimate these quantities are discussed and\nbest-estimates are strictly selected. Bulk densities are subsequently computed\nand compared with meteorite density, allowing to estimate the macroporosity\nwithin these bodies. Dwarf-planets apparently have no macroporosity, while\nsmaller bodies can have large voids. This trend is apparently correlated with\nsize: C and S-complex asteroids tends to have larger density with increasing\ndiameter. The average density of each Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classes is computed.\nS-complex asteroids are more dense on average than those in the C-complex that\nin turn have a larger macroporosity, although both complexes partly overlap.\nWithin the C-complex, B-types stand out in albedo, reflectance spectra, and\ndensity, indicating a unique composition. Asteroids in the X-complex span a\nwide range of densities, suggesting that many compositions are included in the\ncomplex. Comets and TNOs have high macroporosity and low density, supporting\nthe current models of internal structures made of icy aggregates.

Proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase\napproximation (pn-QRPA) theory has recently being used for a microscopic\ncalculation of stellar weak interaction rates of iron isotopes with success.\nHere I present the detailed calculation of neutrino and antineutrino cooling\nrates due to key iron isotopes in stellar matter using the pn-QRPA theory. The\nrates are calculated on a fine grid of temperature-density scale suitable for\ncore-collapse simulators. The calculated rates are compared against earlier\ncalculations. The neutrino cooling rates due to isotopes of iron are in overall\ngood agreement with the rates calculated using the large-scale shell model.\nDuring the presupernova evolution of massive stars, from oxygen shell burning\ntill around end of convective core silicon burning phases, the calculated\nneutrino cooling rates due to $^{54}$Fe are three to four times larger than the\ncorresponding shell model rates. The Brink's hypothesis used in previous\ncalculations can at times lead to erroneous results. The Brink's hypothesis\nassumes that the Gamow-Teller strength distributions for all excited states are\nthe same. It is, however, shown by the present calculation that both the\ncentroid and total strength for excited states differ appreciably from the\nground state distribution. These changes in the strength distributions of\nthermally populated excited states can alter the total weak interaction rates\nrather significantly. The calculated antineutrino cooling rates, due to\npositron capture and $\\beta$-decay of iron isotopes, are orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the corresponding neutrino cooling rates and can safely be\nneglected specially at low temperatures and high stellar densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 08:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-21"}

Two kinds of inertial modes therefore exist, depending on whether\nthe hyperbolic domain where characteristics propagate covers the whole shell or\nnot. The occurrence of these two kinds of inertial modes is examined, and we\nshow that the range of frequencies at which inertial waves may propagate is\nbroader than with solid-body rotation. Using high-resolution calculations based\non a spectral method, we show that, as with solid-body rotation, singular modes\nwith thin shear layers following short-period attractors still exist with\ndifferential rotation. They exist even in the case of a full sphere. In the\nlimit of vanishing viscosities, the width of the shear layers seems to weakly\ndepend on the global background shear, showing a scaling in E^{1/3} with the\nEkman number E, as in the solid-body rotation case. There also exist modes with\nthin detached layers of width scaling with E^{1/2} as Ekman boundary layers.\nThe behavior of inertial waves with a corotation resonance within the shell is\nalso considered. For cylindrical rotation, waves get dramatically absorbed at\ncorotation. In contrast, for shellular rotation, waves may cross a critical\nlayer without visible absorption, and such modes can be unstable for small\nenough Ekman numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 08:59:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 14:23:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 12:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Our basic result is in providing an exact characterization\nof the fastest achievable exponential decay rate, among all possible\nmodulator-estimator (transmitter-receiver) pairs, where the modulator is\nlimited only in the signal power, but not in bandwidth.

In addition, two different sets of pairwise amino acid interactions\nare considered: one promoting exclusively native interactions, and the other\nadditionally including non-native quasi-chemical and electrostatic\ninteractions. With the former model neither protein show a propensity to form\nknots. With the additional non-native interactions, knotting propensity remains\nnegligible for the natively-unknotted OTCase while for AOTCase it is much\nenhanced. Analysis of the trajectories suggests that the different entanglement\nof the two transcarbamylases follows from the tendency of the C-terminal to\npoint away from (for OTCase) or approach and eventually thread (for AOTCase)\nother regions of partly-folded protein. The analysis of the OTCase/AOTCase pair\nclarifies that natively-knotted proteins can spontaneously knot during early\nfolding stages and that non-native sequence-dependent interactions are\nimportant for promoting and disfavoring early knotting events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 10:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Such hypothetical primordial objects may have\nbeen the seed of the massive black holes (BHs) observed at the centre of\ngalaxies. Under the standard picture, these objects can be approximately\ndescribed as n=3 polytropes, and they are expected to shine extremely close to\ntheir Eddington luminosity. Once however, one considers the porosity induced by\ninstabilities near the Eddington limit, which give rise to super-Eddington\nstates, the standard picture should be modified. We study the structure,\nevolution and mass loss of these objects. We find the following. First, the\nevolution of SMSs is hastened due to their increased energy release. They\naccelerate continuum driven winds. If there is no rotational stabilization,\nthese winds are insufficient to \"evaporate\" the objects, such that they can\ncollapse to form a supermassive BHs, however, they do prevent SMSs from\nemitting a copious amount of ionizing radiation. If the SMSs are rotationally\nstabilized, the winds \"evaporate\" the objects until a normal sub-Eddington star\nremains, having a mass of a few 100Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 10:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Statistical\nreliability of the method is studied by means of synthetic data analysis. The\nexperimental measurements on MAST indicate that the apparent mean poloidal\nmotion of the turbulent density patterns in the lab frame arises because the\nlongest correlation direction of the patterns (parallel to the local background\nmagnetic fields) is not parallel to the direction of the fastest mean plasma\nflows (usually toroidal when strong neutral beam injection is present). The\nexperimental measurements are consistent with the mean motion of plasma being\ntoroidal. The sum of all other contributions (mean poloidal plasma flow, phase\nvelocity of the density patterns in the plasma frame, non-linear effects, etc.)\nto the apparent mean poloidal velocity of the density patterns is found to be\nnegligible. These results hold in all investigated L-mode, H-mode and internal\ntransport barrier (ITB) discharges. The one exception is a high-poloidal-beta\n(the ratio of the plasma pressure to the poloidal magnetic field energy\ndensity) discharge, where a large magnetic island exists. In this case BES\ndetects very little motion.

We\nwish to figure out whether the differences between the seismic rotation period\nas determined by a mean rotational splitting, and the rotation period measured\nfrom the low frequency peak in the Fourier spectrum (observed for some of\nCoRoT's targets) can provide constraints on the rotation profile. For uniform\nmoderate rotators,perturbative corrections to second and third order in terms\nof the rotation angular velocity \\Omega, may mimic differential rotation. We\napply our perturbation method to evaluate mode frequencies accurate up to\n\\Omega^3 for uniform rotation. Effects of latitudinal dependence are calculated\nin the linear approximation. In \\beta Cephei pulsators models, third order\neffects become comparable to that of a horizontal shear similar to the solar\none at rotation rates well below the breakup values. We show how a clean\nsignature of the latitudinal shear may be extracted. Our models of two CoRoT\ntarget HD 181906 and HD 181420, represent lower main sequence objects. These\nare slow rotators and nonlinear effects in splittings are accordingly small. We\nuse data on one low frequency peak and one splitting of a dipolar mode to\nconstrain the rotation profile in HD 181420 and HD 181906. The relative\ninfluence of the two effects strongly depends on the type of the oscillation\nmodes in the star and on the magnitude of the rotation rate. Given mean\nrotational splitting and the frequency of a spot signature, it is possible to\ndistinguish between the two hypothesis, and in the case of differential\nrotation in latitude, we propose a method to determine the type of rotation\nprofile and a range of values for the shear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 11:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

In this work the possible link between\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities and thread lifetimes is investigated. This is\ndone by calculating the eigenmodes of a thread modelled as a Cartesian slab\nunder the presence of gravity. An analytical dispersion relation is derived\nusing the incompressible assumption for the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nperturbations. The system allows a mode that is always stable, independently of\nthe value of the Alfv\\'en speed in the thread. The character of this mode\nvaries from being localised at the upper interface of the slab when the\nmagnetic field is weak, to having a global nature and resembling the transverse\nkink mode when the magnetic field is strong. On the contrary, the slab model\npermits another mode that is unstable and localised at the lower interface when\nthe magnetic field is weak. The growth rates of this mode can be very short, of\nthe order of minutes for typical thread conditions. This Rayleigh-Taylor\nunstable mode becomes stable when the magnetic field is increased, and in the\nlimit of strong magnetic field it is essentially a sausage magnetic mode. The\ngravity force might have a strong effect on the modes of oscillation of\nthreads, depending on the value of the Alfv\\'en speed. In the case of threads\nin quiescent filaments, where the Alfv\\'en speed is presumably low, very short\nlifetimes are expected according to the slab model. In active region\nprominences, the stabilising effect of the magnetic tension might be enough to\nsuppress the Rayleigh-Taylor instability for a wide range of wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 11:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We focus\nhere on one object J004441.04-732136.4, which is the only known 21 micrometer\nsource of the SMC. Spectral abundance results reveal J004441.04-732136.4 to be\none of the most s-process enriched objects found up to date, while the\nphotospheric C/O ratio of 1.9 +- 0.7, shows the star is only modestly C-rich.\nJ004441.04-732136.4 also displays a low [Fe/H] = -1.34 +- 0.32, which is\nsignificantly lower than the mean metallicity of the SMC. From the SED, a\nluminosity of 7600 +- 200 solar luminosities is found, together with E(B-V) =\n0.64 +- 0.02.

Therefore the present method requires shorter pulse\ndurations, and enables the study of inhomogeneity at higher RF powers.

In addition to the correction of\natmospheric path-length differences, a decent control algorithm should correct\nfor disturbances introduced by instrumental vibrations, and deal with other\nerrors propagating in the optical trains. We attempt to construct control\nschemes based on Kalman filters. Kalman filtering is an optimal data processing\nalgorithm for tracking and correcting a system on which observations are\nperformed. As a direct application, control schemes are designed for GRAVITY, a\nfuture four-telescope near-infrared beam combiner for the Very Large Telescope\nInterferometer (VLTI). We base our study on recent work in adaptive-optics\ncontrol. The technique is to describe perturbations of fringe phases in terms\nof an a priori model. The model allows us to optimize the tracking of fringes,\nin that it is adapted to the prevailing perturbations. Since the model is of a\nparametric nature, a parameter identification needs to be included. Different\npossibilities exist to generalize to the four-telescope fringe tracking that is\nuseful for GRAVITY. On the basis of a two-telescope Kalman-filtering control\nalgorithm, a set of two properly working control algorithms for four-telescope\nfringe tracking is constructed. The control schemes are designed to take into\naccount flux problems and low-signal baselines. First simulations of the\nfringe-tracking process indicate that the defined schemes meet the requirements\nfor GRAVITY and allow us to distinguish in performance.

The\nformer allows, in principle, to reconcile the presence of cosmological scalar\nfields with the constraints from experiments at the Solar System scale. The\nlatter open up the possibility of building inflationary models that, among\nother things, do not need ad hoc potentials. Further generalizations have\nfinally led to the most general tensor-scalar theory, recently dubbed the \"Fab\nFour\", with only first and second order derivatives of the fields in the\nequations of motion and that self-tune to a vanishing cosmological constant.\nThis model has a very rich phenomenology that needs to be explored and\nconfronted with experimental data in order to constrain a very large parameter\nspace. In this paper, we present some results regarding a subset of the theory\nnamed \"John\", which corresponds to a non-minimal derivative coupling between\nthe scalar field and the Einstein tensor in the action. We show that this\ncoupling gives rise to an inflationary model with very unnatural initial\nconditions. Thus, we include a non-minimal, but non-derivative, coupling\nbetween scalar field and Ricci scalar, a term named \"George\" in the Fab Four\nterminology.

One of the most\nimportant questions in the field is \"which valuation domains admit truthful\nbudget feasible mechanisms with `small' approximations (compared to the social\noptimum)?\" Singer showed that additive and submodular functions have such\nconstant approximations. Recently, Dobzinski, Papadimitriou, and Singer gave an\nO(log^2 n)-approximation mechanism for subadditive functions; they also\nremarked that: \"A fundamental question is whether, regardless of computational\nconstraints, a constant-factor budget feasible mechanism exists for subadditive\nfunctions.\"\n  We address this question from two viewpoints: prior-free worst case analysis\nand Bayesian analysis. For the prior-free framework, we use an LP that\ndescribes the fractional cover of the valuation function; it is also connected\nto the concept of approximate core in cooperative game theory. We provide an\nO(I)-approximation mechanism for subadditive functions, via the worst case\nintegrality gap I of LP. This implies an O(log n)-approximation for subadditive\nvaluations, O(1)-approximation for XOS valuations, and for valuations with a\nconstant I. XOS valuations are an important class of functions that lie between\nsubmodular and subadditive classes. We give another polynomial time O(log\nn/loglog n) sub-logarithmic approximation mechanism for subadditive valuations.\n  For the Bayesian framework, we provide a constant approximation mechanism for\nall subadditive functions, using the above prior-free mechanism for XOS\nvaluations as a subroutine.

Homogeneous and inhomogeneous unpinning\ngeometries, representing creep- and avalanche-like glitches, provide lower and\nupper bounds on the gravitational wave signal strength respectively. The signal\narising from homogeneous glitches is found to scale with the square root of\nglitch size, whereas the signal from inhomogeneous glitches scales proportional\nto glitch size. The signal is also computed as a function of vortex travel\ndistance and stellar angular velocity. Convenient amplitude scalings are\nderived as functions of these parameters. For the typical astrophysical\nsituation, where the glitch duration (in units of the spin period) is large\ncompared to the vortex travel distance (in units of the stellar radius), an\nindividual glitch from an object $1\\,\\rm{kpc}$ from Earth generates a wave\nstrain of $10^{-24} [(\\Delta\\omega/\\omega) / 10^{-7}] (\\omega/10^2 \\rm{rad\ns}^{-1})^3 (\\Delta r / 10^{-2} \\rm{m})^{-1}$, where $\\Delta r$ is the average\ndistance travelled by a vortex during a glitch, $\\Delta\\omega/\\omega$ is the\nfractional glitch size, and $\\omega$ is the pulsar angular velocity.

The EM is best suited for situations\nwhere the expectation in each E-step and the maximization in each M-step are\nstraightforward. A difficulty with the implementation of the EM algorithm is\nthat each E-step requires the integration of the log-likelihood function in\nclosed form. The explicit integration can be avoided by using what is known as\nthe Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm. The MCEM uses a random sample to estimate\nthe integral at each E-step. However, the problem with the MCEM is that it\noften converges to the integral quite slowly and the convergence behavior can\nalso be unstable, which causes a computational burden. In this paper, we\npropose what we refer to as the quantile variant of the EM (QEM) algorithm.

The main purpose of this meeting was to strengthen the\nscientific collaboration between the participants of the Iberian and the rest\nof the southern European branches of the European Nuclear Astrophysics network,\nformerly, COMPSTAR. This ESF (European Science Foundation) supported network\nhas been crucial in helping to make a broader audience for the the most\ninteresting and relevant research lines being developed currently in Nuclear\nAstrophysics, especially related to the physics of neutron stars. The program\nof the meeting was tailored to theoretical descriptions of the physics of\nneutron stars although some input from experimental observers and other\ncondensed matter and optics areas of interest was also included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 21:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

This article shows the\nimportant role of high-energy quantized vibrations and their non-equilibrium\ndynamics for energy transfer in photosynthetic systems with highly localized\nexcitonic states. We consider the cryptophyte antennae protein phycoerythrin\n545 and show that coupling to quantized vibrations which are quasi-resonant\nwith excitonic transitions is fundamental for biological function as it\ngenerates non-cascaded transport with rapid and wider spatial distribution of\nexcitation energy. Our work also indicates that the non-equilibrium dynamics of\nsuch vibrations can manifest itself in ultrafast beating of both excitonic\npopulations and coherences at room temperature, with time scales in agreement\nwith those reported in experiments. Moreover, we show that mechanisms\nsupporting coherent excitonic dynamics assist coupling to selected modes that\nchannel energy to preferential sites in the complex. We therefore argue that,\nin the presence of strong coupling between electronic excitations and quantized\nvibrations, a concrete and important advantage of quantum coherent dynamics is\nprecisely to tune resonances that promote fast and effective energy\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 15:42:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 18:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}
