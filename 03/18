The transport,\nmagnetotransport and non-linear conduction (I-V curves) were analysed using the\nconcept of Spin Polarized Tunnelling in the presence of Coulomb blockade. The\nactivation energy of transport, \\Delta, was used to estimate the tunnelling\ndistances and the inverse decay length of the tunnelling wave function (\\chi)\nand the height of the tunnelling barrier (\\Phi_B). The magnetotransport data\nwere used to find out the magnetic field dependences of these tunnelling\nparameters. The data taken over a large magnetic field range allowed us to\nseparate out the MR contributions at low temperatures arising from tunnelling\ninto two distinct contributions. In LCMO, at low magnetic field, the transport\nand the MR are dominated by the spin polarization, while at higher magnetic\nfield the MR arises from the lowering of the tunnel barrier by the magnetic\nfield leading to an MR that does not saturate even at 14 T. In contrast, in\nLSCO, which does not have substantial spin polarization, the first contribution\nat low field is absent, while the second contribution related to the barrier\nheight persists. The idea of inter-grain tunnelling has been validated by\ndirect measurements of the non-linear I-V data in this temperature range and\nthe I-V data was found to be strongly dependent on magnetic field. We made the\nimportant observation that a gap like feature (with magnitude ~ E_C, the\nCoulomb charging energy) shows up in the conductance g(V) at low bias for the\nsystems with smallest nanocrystal size at lowest temperatures (T < 0.7 K). The\ngap closes as the magnetic field and the temperature are increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2012 16:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-20"}

We argue that by using\nsimple developments of these models, in the context of new multi-frequency data\nextending to gamma-ray energies, valuable insights may be obtained into the\nproperties that fully realistic models must ultimately have. In this paper we\nconsider the synchrotron and synchrotron-self-Compton emission from the jet,\nmodelling the recent simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of BL Lac. This\nis the first time these components have been fitted simultaneously for a blazar\nusing a conical jet model.\n  In the model we evolve the electron population dynamically along the jet\ntaking into account the synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses. The\ninverse-Compton emission is calculated using the Klein-Nishina cross section\nand a relativistic transformation into the jet frame, and we explicitly show\nthe seed photon population. We integrate synchrotron opacity along the line of\nsight through the jet plasma, taking into account the emission and opacity of\neach section of the jet. In agreement with previous studies of radio emission,\nwe find that a conical jet model which conserves magnetic energy produces the\ncharacteristic blazar flat radio spectrum, however, we do not require any\nfine-tuning of the model to achieve this. Of particular note, in our model fit\nto BL Lac--which at ~10^37W is a relatively low jet-power source--we find no\nrequirement for significant re-acceleration within the jet to explain the\nobserved spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2012 18:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-13"}

This\nmode may be further coupled to a dissipative thermal environment. Adopting a\nmaster equation approach, we confirm the charge and heat exchange fluctuation\ntheorem in the steady-state limit, for both harmonic and anharmonic models.\nUsing simple analytical expressions, we calculate the charge current and\nseveral measures for the mode effective temperature. At low bias, we observe\nthe effect of bias-induced cooling of the vibrational mode. At higher bias, the\nmode effective temperature is higher than the environmental temperature, yet\nthe junction is stable. Beyond that, once the vibrational mode (bias-induced)\nexcitation rate overcomes its relaxation rate, instability occurs. We identify\nregimes of instability as a function of voltage bias and coupling to an\nadditional phononic thermal bath. Interestingly, we observe a reentrant\nbehavior where an unstable junction can properly behave at a high enough bias.\nThe mechanism for this behavior is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2012 02:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Under a\nproper gate voltage, the total in-plane effective magnetic field in (111)\nGaAs/AlAs quantum wells can be strongly suppressed in the whole momentum space,\nwhile the one in (111) GaAs/InP quantum wells can be suppressed only on a\nspecial momentum circle. The hole spin relaxation due to the D'yakonov-Perel'\nand Elliott-Yafet mechanisms is calculated by means of the fully microscopic\nkinetic spin Bloch equation approach with all the relevant scatterings\nexplicitly included. For (111) GaAs/AlAs quantum wells, extremely long\nheavy-hole spin relaxation time (upto hundreds of nanoseconds) is predicted. In\naddition, we predict a pronounced peak in the gate-voltage dependence of the\nheavy-hole spin relaxation time due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism. This\npeak origins from the suppression of the unique inhomogeneous broadening in\n(111) GaAs/AlAs quantum wells. Moreover, the Elliott-Yafet mechanism influences\nthe spin relaxation only around the peak area due to the small spin mixing\nbetween the heavy and light holes in quantum wells with small well width. We\nalso show the anisotropy of the spin relaxation. In (111) GaAs/InP quantum\nwells, a mild peak, similar to the case for electrons in (111) GaAs quantum\nwells, is also predicted in the gate-voltage dependence of the light-hole spin\nrelaxation time. The contribution of the Elliott-Yafet mechanism is always\nnegligible in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2012 08:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-14"}

An incremental approach is presented in order to determine the\nsuccessive moves of the Actor to extinguish fire in an environment with and\nwithout obstacles.

Grid axes\nare tightly aligned across simultaneously recorded units. Recent experimental\nfindings have shown that grids can often be better described as elliptical\nrather than purely circular and that, beyond the mutual alignment of their grid\naxes, ellipses tend to also orient their long axis along preferred directions.\nAre grid alignment and ellipse orientation the same phenomenon? Does the grid\nalignment result from single-unit mechanisms or does it require network\ninteractions?\n  We address these issues by refining our model, to describe specifically the\nspontaneous emergence of conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells in layers\nIII, V and VI of mEC. We find that tight alignment can be produced by recurrent\ncollateral interactions, but this requires head-direction modulation. Through a\ncompetitive learning process driven by spatial inputs, grid fields then form\nalready aligned, and with randomly distributed spatial phases. In addition, we\nfind that the self-organization process is influenced by the behavior of the\nsimulated rat. The common grid alignment often orients along preferred running\ndirections. The shape of individual grids is distorted towards an ellipsoid\narrangement when some speed anisotropy is present in exploration behavior.\nSpeed anisotropy on its own also tends to align grids, even without\ncollaterals, but the alignment is seen to be loose. Finally, the alignment of\nspatial grid fields in multiple environments shows that the network expresses\nthe same set of grid fields across environments, modulo a coherent rotation and\ntranslation. Thus, an efficient metric encoding of space may emerge through\nspontaneous pattern formation at the single-unit level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2012 15:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-20"}
