The agents interact with each other on a local level and\ndiffuse information across the network through their collaborations. In this\nwork, we consider two types of agents: informed agents and uninformed agents.\nThe former receive new data regularly and perform consultation and in-network\ntasks, while the latter do not collect data and only participate in the\nconsultation tasks. We examine the performance of adaptive networks as a\nfunction of the proportion of informed agents and their distribution in space.\nThe results reveal some interesting and surprising trade-offs between\nconvergence rate and mean-square performance. In particular, among other\nresults, it is shown that the performance of adaptive networks does not\nnecessarily improve with a larger proportion of informed agents. Instead, it is\nestablished that the larger the proportion of informed agents is, the faster\nthe convergence rate of the network becomes albeit at the expense of some\ndeterioration in mean-square performance. The results further establish that\nuninformed agents play an important role in determining the steady-state\nperformance of the network, and that it is preferable to keep some of the\nhighly connected agents uninformed. The arguments reveal an important interplay\namong three factors: the number and distribution of informed agents in the\nnetwork, the convergence rate of the learning process, and the estimation\naccuracy in steady-state. Expressions that quantify these relations are\nderived, and simulations are included to support the theoretical findings.

Finally, we show that off-stoichiometric compositions\nwith excess Mn promote transitions to a non-modulated tetragonal structure, in\nagreement with experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 17:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-09"}

Our aims are to identify possible active longitudes,\nestimate the differential rotation and study long and short term changes in the\nactivity. Our analysis is based on 24 years of Johnson V-band photometry. We\nuse the previously published Continuous Period Search (CPS) method to model the\nevolution of the light curve of LQ Hya. The CPS fits a Fourier series model to\nshort overlapping subsets of data. This enables us to monitor the spot\nconfiguration of the star with a higher time resolution. We find seasonal\nvariability in the mean level and amplitude of the light curve of LQ Hya. The\nvariability of the light curve amplitude seems not to be cyclic, but the\nlong-term variations in the mean magnitude could be explained by an\napproximately 13 year cycle. Because of the limited length of the observed time\nseries, it is not yet possible to determine whether this structure really is\nperiodic and represents an activity cycle. We estimate the differential\nrotation of the star to be small, and the star is potentially very close to a\nrigid rotator. We search for active longitudes and find that on time scales up\nto six months there are typically one or two relatively stable active areas on\nthe star with limited phase migration. On time scales longer than one year, no\nstable active longitudes have been present except for the period between 2003\nand 2009 and possibly also some time before 1995. We find any signs of\nflip-flops with a regular period.

This\npaper develops algorithms for distributed sparsity-regularized rank\nminimization over networks, when the nuclear- and $\\ell_1$-norm are used as\nsurrogates to the rank and nonzero entry counts of the sought matrices,\nrespectively. While nuclear-norm minimization has well-documented merits when\ncentralized processing is viable, non-separability of the singular-value sum\nchallenges its distributed minimization. To overcome this limitation, an\nalternative characterization of the nuclear norm is adopted which leads to a\nseparable, yet non-convex cost minimized via the alternating-direction method\nof multipliers. The novel distributed iterations entail reduced-complexity\nper-node tasks, and affordable message passing among single-hop neighbors.\nInterestingly, upon convergence the distributed (non-convex) estimator provably\nattains the global optimum of its centralized counterpart, regardless of\ninitialization. Several application domains are outlined to highlight the\ngenerality and impact of the proposed framework. These include unveiling\ntraffic anomalies in backbone networks, predicting networkwide path latencies,\nand mapping the RF ambiance using wireless cognitive radios. Simulations with\nsynthetic and real network data corroborate the convergence of the novel\ndistributed algorithm, and its centralized performance guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 19:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}

It is largely accepted that the mobility-limiting\nfactor in graphene is the Coulomb scattering off of charged impurities that\nreside either on graphene or in the underlying substrate. This is true both for\ntraditional graphene devices on SiO2 substrates and possibly for the recently\nreported high-mobility suspended and supported devices. An attractive approach\nto reduce such scattering is to place graphene in an environment with high\nstatic dielectric constant \\kappa\\ that would effectively screen the electric\nfield due to the impurities. However, experiments so far report only a modest\neffect of high-\\kappa\\ environment on mobility. Here, we investigate the effect\nof the dielectric environment of graphene by studying electrical transport in\nmulti-terminal graphene devices that are suspended in liquids with \\kappa\\\nranging from 1.9 to 33. For non-polar liquids (\\kappa <5) we observe a rapid\nincrease of \\mu\\ with \\kappa\\ and report a record room-temperature mobility as\nlarge as ~60,000 cm2/Vs for graphene devices in anisole (\\kappa=4.3), while in\npolar liquids (\\kappa >18) we observe a drastic drop in mobility. We\ndemonstrate that non-polar liquids enhance mobility by screening charged\nimpurities adsorbed on graphene, while charged ions in polar liquids cause the\nobserved mobility suppression. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation\nwe establish that scattering by out-of-plane flexural phonons, a dominant\nscattering mechanism in suspended graphene in vacuum at room temperature, is\nsuppressed by the presence of liquids.

The model describes spectral indices, fluxes and the duration of the\nhigh-energy component as well as a long keV tail present in the prompt phase of\nGRB980923. Here, we present an extension of this model to describe the\nhigh-energy emission of GRB090926A. We argue that the emission consist of two\ncomponents, one with a duration less than 1s during the prompt phase, and a\nsecond, longer-lasting GeV phase lasting hundred of seconds after the prompt\nphase. The short high-energy phase can be described as SSC emission from a\nreverse shock similar to that observed in GRB980923, while the longer component\narises from the forward shock. The main assumption is that the jet is\nmagnetized and evolves in the thick-shell case, and the calculated fluxes and\nbreak energies are all consistent with the observed values. A comparison\nbetween the resulting parameters obtained for GRB980923 and GRB090926A suggests\ndifferences in burst tails that could be attributable to the circumburst\nmedium, and this could account for previous analyses reported in the literature\nfor other bursts.

Results show that as the interuser link qualities\nincrease, the optimal scheme moves from no cooperation to partial then to full\ncooperation, in which the users fully exchange their information and\ncooperatively send it to the destination. Therefore, in practical systems with\nstrong inter-user links, simple decode-forward relaying at both users is\nrate-optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 20:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2013 15:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

In the case of\ngene regulatory networks (GRNs) they correspond to stable genes profiles\nassociated to the various cell types.

We start this paper by proving that, if we\nfix the values of the source nodes (nodes with in-degree 0), the expected\nnumber of fixed points of any RBN is one (independently of the topology we\nchoose). For finding such fixed points we use the {\\alpha}-asynchronous\ndynamics (where every node is updated independently with probability 0 <\n{\\alpha} < 1). In fact, it is well-known that asynchrony avoids the cycle\nattractors into which parallel dynamics tends to fall. We perform simulations\nand we show the remarkable property that, if for a given RBN with scale-free\ntopology and {\\alpha}-asynchronous dynamics an initial configuration reaches a\nfixed point, then every configuration also reaches a fixed point. By contrast,\nin the parallel regime, the percentage of initial configurations reaching a\nfixed point (for the same networks) is dramatically smaller.

We model stellar angular momentum evolution starting\nwith a rotation distribution from open cluster M37. Our predicted\nrotation-mass-age relationship shows significant zero-point offsets compared to\nan alternative angular momentum loss law and published gyrochronology\nrelations. Systematic errors at the 30 percent level are permitted by current\ndata, highlighting the need for empirical guidance. We identify two fundamental\nsources of uncertainty that limit the precision of rotation-based ages and\nquantify their impact. Stars are born with a range of rotation rates, which\nleads to an age range at fixed rotation period. We find that the inherent\nambiguity from the initial conditions is important for all young stars, and\nremains large for old stars below 0.6 solar masses. Latitudinal surface\ndifferential rotation also introduces a minimum uncertainty into rotation\nperiod measurements and, by extension, rotation-based ages. Both models and the\ndata from binary star systems 61 Cyg and alpha Cen demonstrate that latitudinal\ndifferential rotation is the limiting factor for rotation-based age precision\namong old field stars, inducing uncertainties at the ~2 Gyr level. We also\nexamine the relationship between variability amplitude, rotation period, and\nage. Existing ground-based surveys can detect field populations with ages as\nold as 1-2 Gyr, while space missions can detect stars as old as the Galactic\ndisk.

We analyzed and discussed\nmore about the dynamics, metallicity and age, and their distributions as well\nas the relationships between these parameters. Eight more confirmed GCs in the\nhalo of M31 were observed, most of which lack the spectroscopic information\nbefore. These star clusters are located far from the galactic center at a\nprojected radius of ~14 to ~117 kpc. The Lick absorption-line indices and the\nradial velocities have been measured and ages, metallicities [Fe/H] and\nalpha-element [alpha/Fe] have also been fitted by comparing the observed\nspectral feature indices and Thomas et al.SSP model. Our results show that most\nof the star clusters of our sample are older than 10 Gyr except B290 ~5.5 Gyr,\nand most of them are metal-poor with the metallicity [Fe/H]<-1, suggesting that\nthese clusters were born at the early stage of the galaxy's formation. We find\nthat the metallicity gradient for the outer halo clusters with r_p>25 kpc may\nnot exist with a slope of -0.005+-0.005 dex kpc^-1. We also find that the\nmetallicity is not a function of age for the GCs with age < 7 Gyr while for the\nold GCs with age >7 Gyr there seems to be a trend that the older ones have\nlower metallicity. Besides, We plot metallicity distributions with the largest\nsample of M31 GCs so far and it shows the bimodality is not significant and the\nnumber of the metal-poor and metal-rich groups becomes comparable. The spatial\ndistributions shows that the metal-rich group is more centrally concentrated\nwhile the metal-poor group is occupy a more extended halo and the young\npopulation is centrally concentrated while the old population is more extended\nspatially to the outer halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 03:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In particular, we seek to\ndemonstrate the potential existence of traditional baroclinic instabilities of\nmeteorological studies in a simplified two-layer Philips Disk Model. Each disk\nlayer is of constant but differing densities. The resulting mean azimuthal\nvelocity profile shows a variation in the vertical direction implying that the\nsystem is baroclinic in the mean state. The stability of the system is treated\nin the context of disk shallow water theory wherein azimuthal disturbances are\nmuch longer than the corresponding radial or vertical scales. The normal-mode\nproblem is solved numerically using two different methods. The results of a\nsymmetric single layer barotropic model is considered and it is found that\ninstability persists for models in which the potential vorticity profiles are\nnot symmetric, consistent with previous results. The instaiblity is interpreted\nin terms of interacting Rossby waves. For a two layer system in which the flow\nis fundamentally baroclinic we report here that instability takes on the form\nof mixed barotropic-baroclinic type: instability occurs but it qualitatively\nfollows the pattern of instability found in the barotropic models. Instability\narises because of the phase locking and interaction of the Rossby waves between\nthe two layers. The strength of the instability weakens as the density contrast\nbetween layers increases.

We find that the max norm of\nthe error achieved with a \\SpAMM{} tolerance below $2 \\times 10^{-8}$ is lower\nthan that of the single-precision {\\tt SGEMM} for dense quantum chemical\nmatrices, while outperforming {\\tt SGEMM} with a cross-over already for small\nmatrices ($n \\sim 1000$). Relative to naive implementations of \\SpAMM{} using\nIntel's Math Kernel Library ({\\tt MKL}) or AMD's Core Math Library ({\\tt\nACML}), our optimized version is found to be significantly faster. Detailed\nperformance comparisons are made for quantum chemical matrices with differently\nstructured sub-blocks. Finally, we discuss the potential of improved hardware\nprefetch to yield 2--3x speedups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 05:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 22:42:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 21:49:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 22:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 18:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-05"}

We present a new approach to confront\nsmall-scale non-linearities in the power spectrum of matter fluctuations. This\never-present and pernicious uncertainty is often the Achilles' heel in\ncosmological studies and must be reduced if we are to see the advent of\nprecision cosmology in the late-time Universe. We show that an optimally\ntrained artificial neural network (ANN), when presented with a set of\ncosmological parameters (Omega_m h^2, Omega_b h^2, n_s, w_0, sigma_8, m_nu and\nredshift z), can provide a worst-case error <=1 per cent (for z<=2) fit to the\nnon-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations, for modes\nup to k<=0.7 h/Mpc. Our power spectrum interpolator is accurate over the entire\nparameter space. This is a significant improvement over some of the current\nmatter power spectrum calculators. In this paper, we detail how an accurate\ninterpolation of the matter power spectrum is achievable with only a sparsely\nsampled grid of cosmological parameters. Unlike large-scale N-body simulations\nwhich are computationally expensive and/or infeasible, a well-trained ANN can\nbe an extremely quick and reliable tool in interpreting cosmological\nobservations and parameter estimation. This paper is the first in a series. In\nthis method paper, we generate the non-linear matter power spectra using\nHaloFit and use them as mock observations to train the ANN. This work sets the\nfoundation for Paper II, where a suite of N-body simulations will be used to\ncompute the non-linear matter power spectra at sub-per cent accuracy, in the\nquasi-non-linear regime 0.1 h/Mpc <= k <= 0.9 h/Mpc. A trained ANN based on\nthis N-body suite will be released for the scientific community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 05:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 15:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}

This behaviour stabilizes the magnetism caused by the\nchemisorption being against its destruction by the pair formations. Initially\nflat, compressed graphene is shown to buckle spontaneously right after\nchemisorption of single adatoms.

The tunneling formalism is used to calculate the probability for\ndetecting such $E < m$ particles, for a Schwarzschild black hole of\nastrophysical size or in an analogue gravity experiment, as a function of the\ndistance from the horizon and the energy of the particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 10:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-15"}

The key ingredient of the design of NC-Audit is a\nnovel combination of SpaceMac, a homomorphic message authentication code (MAC)\nscheme for network coding, and NCrypt, a novel chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)\nsecure encryption scheme that is compatible with SpaceMac.

The X-ray and the optical bursts are detected in a long observation of\nthis source with the XMM-Newton observatory. This has increased the number of\nthermonuclear X-ray bursts in the LMXBs with simultaneous optical detection by\nseveral factors. The optical bursts are found to have a linear rise followed by\na slow, somewhat exponential decay. Most of the optical bursts have longer rise\nand decay timescale compared to the corresponding X-ray bursts. We have\ndetermined the X-ray and optical excess photon counts in the bursts that allow\nus to look at the optical to X-ray burst fluence ratio for each burst and the\nratio as a function of the X-ray burst intensity and as a function of the\norbital phase. The delay between the onset of the X-ray bursts and the onset of\nthe optical bursts have also been measured and is found to have an average\nvalue of 3.25 seconds. We do not find any convincing evidence of orbital phase\ndependence of the following parameters: X-ray to optical delay, rise time of\nthe optical bursts, and optical to X-ray burst intensity ratio as would be\nexpected if the optical bursts were produced by reprocessing from the surface\nof the secondary star that is facing the compact star.

The\nanalysis lends insights into some recent interpretations of chiroptical\nexperiments, in which this measure, and an associated chirality flux, have been\ntreated as representing physically distinctive \"superchiral\" phenomena. In the\nfully quantized formalism the chirality density is promoted to operator status,\nwhose exploration with reference to an arbitrary polarization basis reveals\nrelationships to optical angular momentum and helicity operators. Analyzing\nmulti-mode beams with complex wave-front structures, notably Laguerre-Gaussian\nmodes, affords a deeper understanding of the interplay between optical\nchirality and optical angular momentum. By developing theory with due\ncognizance of the photonic character of light, it emerges that only the spin\nangular momentum of light is engaged in such observations. Furthermore, it is\nshown that these prominent measures of the helicity of chiral electromagnetic\nradiation have a common basis, in differences between the populations of\noptical modes associated with angular momenta of opposite sign. Using a\ncalculation of the rate of circular dichroism as an example, with coherent\nstates to model the electromagnetic field, it is discovered that two terms\ncontribute to the differential effect. The primary contribution relates to the\ndifference in left- and right- handed photon populations; the only other\ncontribution, which displays a sinusoidal distance-dependence, corresponding to\nthe claim of nodal enhancements, is connected with the quantum photon\nnumber-phase uncertainty relation. From the full analysis, it appears that the\nterm \"superchiral\" can be considered redundant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 11:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

The static\nnonlinear response is finite with the exception of a certain temperature $T_0$\ndetermined by the value of the asymmetry. In a narrow temperature range around\n$T_0$, the modulus of the frequency-dependent cubic response shows a peak at a\nfrequency on the order of the relaxation rate and it vanishes for both, low\nfrequencies and high frequencies.

When the distance D between the confining walls is\nreduced at constant particle number from an initial value D_0, for which a\ncrystalline structure commensurate with the imposed periodicity fits, to\nsmaller values, a succession of phase transitions to imperfectly ordered\nstructures occur. These structures have a reduced number of rows parallel to\nthe boundaries (from n to n-1 to n-2 etc.) and are accompanied by an almost\nperiodic strain pattern, due to \"soliton staircases\" along the boundaries.\nSince standard simulation studies of such transitions are hampered by huge\nhysteresis effects, we apply the phase switch Monte Carlo method to estimate\nthe free energy difference between the structures as a function of the misfit\nbetween D and D_0, thereby locating where the transitions occurs in\nequilibrium.

In particular, tides in non-synchronized bodies and\nlibration in synchronized ones are known to be capable of exciting the\nso-called elliptical instability, i.e. a generic instability corresponding to\nthe destabilization of two-dimensional flows with elliptical streamlines,\nleading to three-dimensional turbulence. We aim here at confirming the\nrelevance of such an elliptical instability in terrestrial bodies by\ndetermining its growth rate, as well as its consequences on energy dissipation,\non magnetic field induction, and on heat flux fluctuations on planetary scales.\nPrevious studies and theoretical results for the elliptical instability are\nre-evaluated and extended to cope with an astrophysical context. In particular,\ngeneric analytical expressions of the elliptical instability growth rate are\nobtained using a local WKB approach, simultaneously considering for the first\ntime (i) a local temperature gradient due to an imposed temperature contrast\nacross the considered layer or to the presence of a volumic heat source and\n(ii) an imposed magnetic field along the rotation axis, coming from an external\nsource.

In order to get insight into\nthe hydro- and thermodynamical characteristics of these structures, we\nperformed a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Instead of analyzing\nextensive simulations of cosmological structure formation, we simulate certain\nwell-defined structures and study the impact of different physical processes as\nwell as of the scale dependencies. In this paper, we continue our work from\nKlar & M\\\"ucket (2010), and extend our simulations into three dimensions.\nInstead of a pancake structure, we now obtain a configuration consisting of\nwell-defined sheets, filaments, and a gaseous halo. We use a set of\nsimulations, parametrized by the length of the initial perturbation L, to\nobtain detailed information on the state of the gas and its evolution inside\nthe filament. For L > 4 Mpc, we obtain filaments which are fully confined by an\naccretion shock. Additionally, they exhibit an isothermal core, which\ntemperature is balanced by radiative cooling and heating due to the UV\nbackground. This indicates on a multiphase structure for the medium temperature\nWHIM. We obtain scaling relations for the main quantities of this core. In the\nvicinity of the halo, the filament's core can be attributed to the cold streams\nfound in cosmological hydro-simulations. Thermal conduction can lead to a\ncomplete evaporation of the cold stream for L > 6 Mpc/h.

The\nunusual, very 1-dimensional band dispersion obtained in previous band\ncalculations is confirmed for the ordered structure, and the overall band\nstructure agrees reasonably with existing photoemission data. Dispersion and\nbandstructure perpendicular to the main dispersive direction is obtained. A\ntemperature dependent band broadening is calculated from configurations with\nthermal disorder of the atomic positions within the unit cell. This leads a\nband broadening of the two bands at the Fermi energy which can become\ncomparable to their energy separation. The bands are particularly sensitive to\nin-plane movements of Mo sites far from the Li-sites, where the\ndensity-of-states is highest. The latter fact makes the effect of Li vacancies\non the two bands relatively small. Spin-polarized band results for the ordered\nstructure show a surprisingly large exchange enhancement on the high DOS Mo\nsites. Consequences for spin fluctuations associated with a cell doubling along\nthe conducting direction are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 15:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

It detects sources in the data, estimates a\nlocal sky background, cuts postage stamp images for all sources, prepares\nobject masks, performs Sersic fitting including neighbours and compiles all\nobjects in a final output catalogue. For the initial source detection GALAPAGOS\napplies SExtractor, while GALFIT is incorporated for modelling Sersic profiles.\nIt measures the background sky involved in the Sersic fitting by means of a\nflux growth curve. GALAPAGOS determines postage stamp sizes based on SExtractor\nshape parameters. In order to obtain precise model parameters GALAPAGOS\nincorporates a complex sorting mechanism and makes use of modern CPU's\nmultiplexing capabilities. It combines SExtractor and GALFIT data in a single\noutput table. When incorporating information from overlapping tiles, GALAPAGOS\nautomatically removes multiple entries from identical sources. GALAPAGOS is\nprogrammed in the Interactive Data Language, IDL. We test the stability and the\nability to properly recover structural parameters extensively with artificial\nimage simulations.

This was\naccomplished by building a web platform in which human groups interact to both\nrespond to questions likely to help predict a behavioral outcome and pose new\nquestions to their peers.

In the single-degenerate\nscenario (SDS), the companion star is non-degenerate and can be significantly\naffected by the explosion. We explore this interaction by means of\nmulti-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations using the FLASH code. We\nconsider several different companion types, including main-sequence-like stars\n(MS), red giants (RG), and helium stars (He). In addition, we include the\nsymmetry-breaking effects of orbital motion, rotation of the non-degenerate\nstar, and Roche-lobe overflow. A detailed study of a sub-grid model for Type Ia\nsupernovae is also presented. We find that the dependence of the unbound\nstellar mass and kick velocity on the initial binary separation can be fitted\nby power-law relations. By using the tracer particles in FLASH, the process\nleading to the unbinding of matter is dominated by ablation, which has usually\nbeen neglected in past analytical studies.
