It presents exceptional X-rays properties (high temperature\nand luminosity), suggesting that it is a very massive cluster. Recent 2D\nanalysis of the gas distribution has revealed a complex and multiphase\nstructure. This paper presents a wide-field weak lensing study of the dark\nmatter distribution in the cluster in order to provide an alternative vision of\nthe merging status of the cluster. The 2D mass distribution is built and\ncompared to the galaxies and gas distributions. A Bayesian method, implemented\nin the Im2shape software, was used to fit the shape parameters of the faint\nbackground galaxies and to correct for PSF smearing. A careful color selection\non the background galaxies was applied to retrieve the weak lensing signal.\nShear signal was measured out to more than 2 Mpc (~12' from the center). The\nradial shear profile was fit with different parametric mass profiles. The 2D\nmass map is built from the shear distribution and used to identify the\ndifferent mass components. The 2D mass map agrees with the galaxy distribution,\nwhile the total mass inferred from weak lensing shows a strong discrepancy to\nthe X-ray deduced mass. Regardless of the method used, the virial mass M200\nfalls in the range 8 to 14 10^14 Msol inside the virial radius (~ 2.0 Mpc), a\nvalue that is two times less than the mass deduced from X-rays. The central\nmass clump appears bimodal in the dark matter distribution, with a mass ratio\n~3:1 between the two components. The infalling clump A2163-B is detected in\nweak lensing as an independent entity. All these results are interpreted in the\ncontext of a multiple merger seen less than 1Gyr after the main crossover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 16:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Here we show how the hierarchy of structures in the density field\ninside voids is reflected by a similar hierarchy of structures in the velocity\nfield. Voids defined by dense filaments and clusters can de described as simple\nexpanding domains with coherent flows everywhere except at their boundaries. At\nscales smaller that the void radius the velocity field breaks into expanding\nsub-domains corresponding to sub- voids. These sub-domains break into even\nsmaller sub-sub domains at smaller scales resulting in a nesting hierarchy of\nlocally expanding domains. The ratio between the magnitude of the velocity\nfield responsible for the expansion of the void and the velocity field defining\nthe sub voids is approximately one order of magnitude. The small-scale\ncomponents of the velocity field play a minor role in the shaping of the voids\nbut they define the local dynamics directly affecting the processes of galaxy\nformation and evolution. The super-Hubble expansion inside voids makes them\ncosmic magnifiers by stretching their internal primordial density fluctuations\nallowing us to probe the small scales in the primordial density field. Voids\nalso act like time machines by \"freezing\" the development of the medium-scale\ndensity fluctuations responsible for the formation of the tenuous web of\nstructures seen connecting proto galaxies in computer simulations. As a result\nof this freezing haloes in voids can remain \"connected\" to this tenuous web\nuntil the present time.

Starting from basic DD\nsequences, more sophisticated schemes were developed that eliminate\nhigher-order terms of the system-environment interaction and are also more\nrobust against experimental imperfections. A particularly successful scheme,\ncalled concatenated DD (CDD), gives a recipe for generating higher order\nsequences by inserting lower order sequences into the delays of a generating\nsequence.

However, it occurs in our model entirely due to the\ninteraction of compact, gravitationally-bound gaseous clumps and is free from\nthe smoothing-length uncertainty that is characteristic of models using sink\nparticles.

This 'heartbeat' state is characterized by a bright\nflare that recurs every ~50-100 seconds, but the profile and duration of the\nflares varies significantly from observation to observation. Based on a\ncomprehensive, phase-resolved study of heartbeats in the RXTE archive, we\ndemonstrate that very different X-ray lightcurves do not require origins in\ndifferent accretion processes. Indeed, our detailed comparison of the\nphase-resolved spectra of a double-peaked oscillation and a single-peaked\noscillation shows that different cycles can have basically similar X-ray\nspectral evolution. We argue that all heartbeat oscillations can be understood\nas the result of a combination of a thermal-viscous radiation pressure\ninstability, a local Eddington limit in the disk, and a sudden,\nradiation-pressure-driven evaporation or ejection event in the inner accretion\ndisk. This ejection appears to be a universal, fundamental part of the rho\nstate, and is largely responsible for a hard X-ray pulse seen in the lightcurve\nof all cycles. We suggest that the detailed shape of oscillations in the mass\naccretion rate through the disk is responsible for the phenomenological\ndifferences between different rho-type lightcurves, and we discuss how future\ntime-dependent simulations of disk instabilities may provide new insights into\nthe role of radiation pressure in the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The universal shape is such that it has an excess of low AM\nmaterial and hence cannot explain the exponential structure of disk galaxies. A\nresolution to this is suggested by the spatial distribution of low AM material\nwhich is found to be in the centre and a conical region close to the axis of\nrotation. A mechanism that preferentially discards the material in the centre\nand prevents the material along the poles from falling onto the disc is\nproposed as a solution.

We analyze the observations in the context of several\ndifferent models, demonstrating that the observations are consistent with a\nsmooth, broad, axisymmetric disk with inner radius 20-100 AU and width >50 AU.\nThe interferometric data require that at least half of the 860 um emission\ndetected by previous single-dish observations with the James Clerk Maxwell\nTelescope be distributed axisymmetrically, ruling out strong contributions from\nflux concentrations on spatial scales of <100 AU. These observations support\nrecent results from the Plateau de Bure Interferometer indicating that previous\ndetections of clumpy structure in the Vega debris disk were spurious.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 21:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

General conditions for the cooling to the\nground state with single and two-electron dark states are obtained. The results\nshow that in the case of the interaction of the resonator with a\nsingle-electron dark state, no cooling of the resonator occurs unless the\nquantum dots are not identical. The steady-state cooling is possible only if\nthe energy state of the quantum dot coupled to the drain electrode is detuned\nfrom the energy states of the dots coupled to the electron source electrode.\nThe detuning has the effect of unequal shifting of the effective dressed states\nof the system that the cooling and heating processes occur at different\nfrequencies. For the case of two electrons injected to the quantum dot system,\nthe creation of a two-particle dark state is established to be possible with\nspin-antiparallel electrons. The results predict that with the two-particle\ndark state, an effective cooling can be achieved even with identical quantum\ndots subject of an asymmetry only in the charging potential energies coupling\nthe injected electrons. It is found that similar to the case of the\nsingle-electron dark state, the asymmetries result in the cooling and heating\nprocesses to occur at different frequencies. However, an important difference\nbetween the single and two-particle dark state cases is that the cooling\nprocess occurs at significantly different frequencies. This indicates that the\nfrequency at which the resonator could be cooled to its ground state can be\nchanged by switching from the one-electron to the two-electron Coulomb blockade\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 06:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 05:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This asymmetry results in the\nformation of a hysteresis loop: $\\oint pdV$, whose value can be non-vanishing\nduring each oscillatory cycle. For flat potentials, a negative value of the\nhysteresis loop leads to the increase in amplitude of consecutive cycles and to\na universe with older and larger successive cycles.

Cosmological hysteresis appears\nto be widespread and exists for a large class of scalar field potentials and\nmechanisms for making the universe bounce. For steep potentials, the value of\nthe hysteresis loop can be positive as well as negative. The expansion factor\nin this case displays quasi-periodic behaviour in which successive cycles can\nbe both larger as well as smaller than previous ones.

In particular we aim at reasoning about possible\nfailures and fault tolerance. We regard systems which are composed of different\nunits: sensors, computational parts and actuators. Considering worst-case\nfailure behavior of system components, our framework is most suited to derive\nreliability guarantees for composed systems. The behavior of system components\nis modeled using monad like constructs that serve as an abstract representation\nfor system behavior. We introduce rules to reason about these representations\nand derive results like guaranteed upper bounds for system failure. Our\napproach is characterized by the fact that we do not just map a certain\ncomponent to a failure probability, but regard distributions of error behavior\nand their evolvement over system runs.

Since the dust optical depth varies with AGB\nchemistry (C-rich or O-rich), our results suggest that the contribution of AGB\nstars to the flux from their host clusters will be closely linked to the\nmetallicity and the progenitor mass of the AGB star, to which dust chemistry\nand mass-loss rate are sensitive.

However, vortices may have different dynamical behaviours in 3D than in\n2D.

This paper presents an algorithm to compute a certified\napproximation to a given parametric space curve with cubic B-spline curves. By\ncertified, we mean that the approximation can approximate the given curve to\nany given precision and preserve the geometric features of the given curve such\nas the topology, singular points, etc. The approximated curve is divided into\nsegments called quasi-cubic B\\'{e}zier curve segments which have properties\nsimilar to a cubic rational B\\'{e}zier curve.

A novel optimization method is\nproposed to select proper weights in the cubic rational B\\'{e}zier curve to\napproximate the given curve. The error of the approximation is controlled by\nthe size of its tetrahedron, which converges to zero by subdividing the curve\nsegments. As an application, approximate implicit equations of the approximated\ncurves can be computed.

Here weak stability means that exponentially growing\nmodes are absent, but the so-called uniform Lopatinskii condition fails at some\nboundary frequency $\\beta$ in the hyperbolic region. As a consequence of this\ndegeneracy there is an amplification phenomenon: outgoing waves of amplitude\n$O(\\eps^2)$ and wavelength $\\eps$ give rise to reflected waves of amplitude\n$O(\\eps)$, so the overall solution has amplitude $O(\\eps)$. Moreover, the\nreflecting waves emanate from a radiating wave that propagates in the boundary\nalong a characteristic of the Lopatinskii determinant. An approximate solution\nthat displays the qualitative behavior just described is constructed by solving\nsuitable profile equations that exhibit a loss of derivatives, so we solve the\nprofile equations by a Nash-Moser iteration. The exact solution is constructed\nby solving an associated singular problem involving singular derivatives of the\nform $\\partial_{x'}+\\beta\\frac{\\partial_{\\theta_0}}{\\eps}$, $x'$ being the\ntangential variables with respect to the boundary. Tame estimates for the\nlinearization of that problem are proved using a first-order calculus of\nsingular pseudodifferential operators constructed in the companion article\n\\cite{CGW2}. These estimates exhibit a loss of one singular derivative and\nforce us to construct the exact solution by a separate Nash-Moser iteration.\nThe same estimates are used in the error analysis, which shows that the exact\nand approximate solutions are close in $L^\\infty$ on a fixed time interval\nindependent of the (small) wavelength $\\eps$. The approach using singular\nsystems allows us to avoid constructing high order expansions and making small\ndivisor assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 14:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

This flexible setup helps capture\nthe informative features and produces sufficient local feature codes by some\nwell-chosen aggregation statistics or pooling operations within each\npartitioned region, even when only a few sample images are available for\ntraining.
