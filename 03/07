The\nsolution is used to compute the phase diagram of the bosonic Hubbard model for\ndifferent lattices. We compare our results with numerical solutions of the\nB-DMFT equations and numerically exact methods, respectively. The very good\nagreement with those numerical results demonstrates that our approach captures\nthe essential physics of correlated bosons both in the Mott insulator and in\nthe superfluid phase. Close to the transition into the superfluid phase the\nmomentum distribution function at zero momentum is found to be strongly\nenhanced already in the normal phase. The linked-cluster expansion also allows\nus to compute dynamical properties such as the spectral function of bosons. The\nevolution of the spectral function across the transition from the normal to the\nsuperfluid phase is seen to be characteristically different for the interaction\ndriven and density driven transition, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 16:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We provide a method to construct {\\it accessible\nnonlinear EWs}, which incorporate two important properties. First, they improve\non linear EWs in the sense that each non-linear EW detects more entangled\nstates than its linear counterpart and therefore allow the verification of\nentanglement without critical dependence on having found the 'right' linear\nwitness. Second, they can be evaluated using exactly the same data as for the\nevaluation of the original linear witness. This allows a reanalysis of\npublished experimental data to strengthen statements about entanglement\nverification without the requirement to perform additional measurements. These\nparticular properties make the accessible nonlinear EWs attractive for the\nimplementations in current experiments, for they can also enhance the\nstatistical significance of the entanglement verification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 16:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-02"}

For\nthe old, metal-poor (`blue') clusters, the peak mass of the mass function M_p\nincreases with internal half-mass density rho_h as (M_p proportional to\nrho_h^0.44) whereas it stays approximately constant with galactocentric\ndistance R_gal. The mass functions of these clusters are consistent with a\nsimple scenario in which they formed with a Schechter initial mass function and\nevolved subsequently by internal two-body relaxation. For the intermediate-age\npopulation of metal-rich (\"red\") clusters, the faint end of the previously\nreported power-law luminosity function of the clusters with R_gal > 9 kpc is\ndue to many of those clusters having radii larger than the theoretical maximum\nvalue imposed by the tidal field of NGC 1316 at their R_gal.

Clustering is a recurrent feature in light nuclei, from beryllium to\nnickel. For instance, in $^{12}$C the Hoyle state, crucial for stellar\nnucleosynthesis, can be described as a nuclear molecule consisting of three\nalpha-particles. The mechanism of cluster formation, however, has not yet been\nfully understood. We show that the origin of clustering can be traced back to\nthe depth of the confining nuclear potential. By employing the theoretical\nframework of energy density functionals that encompasses both cluster and\nquantum liquid-drop aspects of nuclei, it is shown that the depth of the\npotential determines the energy spacings between single-nucleon orbitals, the\nlocalization of the corresponding wave functions and, therefore, the degree of\nnucleonic density clustering. Relativistic functionals, in particular, are\ncharacterized by deep single-nucleon potentials. When compared to\nnon-relativistic functionals that yield similar ground-state properties\n(binding energy, deformation, radii), they predict the occurrence of much more\npronounced cluster structures. More generally, clustering is considered as a\ntransitional phenomenon between crystalline and quantum liquid phases of\nfermionic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 16:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

These pulses share many similarities\nwith the nervous impulse, e.g., the propagation velocity as well as the\nmeasured reversible heat production and changes in thickness and length that\ncannot be explained with traditional nerve models. A necessary condition for\nsolitary pulse propagation is the simultaneous existence of nonlinearity and\ndispersion, i.e., the dependence of the speed of sound on density and\nfrequency. A prerequisite for the nonlinearity is the presence of a chain\nmelting transition close to physiological temperatures. The transition causes a\ndensity dependence of the elastic constants which can easily be determined by\nexperiment. The frequency dependence is more difficult to determine. The\ntypical time scale of a nerve pulse is 1 ms, corresponding to a characteristic\nfrequency in the range up to one kHz. Dispersion in the sub-kHz regime is\ndifficult to measure due to the very long wave lengths involved. In this\ncontribution we address theoretically the dispersion of the speed of sound in\nlipid membranes and relate it to experimentally accessible relaxation times by\nusing linear response theory.

The established theory of tunneling two state systems (TTLS) in\nits original form (i.e. without extra fitting functions and parameters), is\nunable to explain this universality. While the TTLS model can be modified,\nparticularly by including long range phonon induced interactions to explain the\nuniversal value of Q, (a) it is not clear that the essential features of the\noriginal model that has been successful in explaining the experimental data is\npreserved, and (b) even if it is, it is not clear that the postulates of the\noriginal model remain necessary. The purpose of this study is to derive the\nuniversal acoustic absorption and related quantities observed in disordered\nsolids by starting from a many-body quantum theory of unspecified amorphous\nblocks that mutually interact through the strain field. Based on very generic\nassumptions and having no adjustable fitting parameters, the frequency and\ninitial state averaged macroscopic attenuation of a group of interacting\ndisordered blocks is calculated in the low temperature regime by a novel \"trace\nmethod\", which then is iterated up-to experimental length scales through a real\nspace renormalization group approach. Then using a heuristic second-order\nperturbation argument, the frequency dependence of Q is found, and combined\nwith the previous result to yield the observed universal values in the MHz-Ghz\nrange of frequencies. It is concluded that strong microscopic postulates are\nnot necessary in order to explain the thermal conductivity, velocity shift and\nsound attenuation of disordered media in the low temperature regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 19:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-07"}

Systems of classical\nself-gravitating particles can be studied with the standard tools of\nequilibrium statistical mechanics, provided the potential is regularized at\nsmall length scales and the system is confined in a box. The confinement\ncondition looks rather unphysical in general, so that it is natural to ask\nwhether what we learn with these studies is relevant to real self-gravitating\nsystems. In order to provide a first answer to this question we consider a\nbasic, simple, yet effective model of globular clusters, the King model. This\nmodel describes a self-consistently confined system, without the need of any\nexternal box, but the stationary state is a non-thermal one. In particular, we\nconsider the King model with a short-distance cutoff on the interactions and we\ndiscuss how such a cutoff affects the caloric curve, i.e. the relation between\ntemperature and energy. We find that the cutoff stabilizes a low-energy phase\nwhich is absent in the King model without cutoff; the caloric curve of the\nmodel with cutoff turns out to be very similar to that of previously studied\nconfined and regularized models, but for the absence of a high-energy gas-like\nphase.

In a seminal piece of work, Eigen and coauthors proposed\nthe quasispecies model in an attempt to understand such an evolutionary\nprocess. Their work has impacted antiviral treatment and vaccine design\nstrategies. Yet, predictions of the quasispecies model are at best viewed as a\nguideline, primarily because it assumes an infinite population size, whereas\nrealistic population sizes can be quite small. In this paper we consider a\npopulation genetics-based model aimed at understanding the evolution of such\norganisms with finite population sizes and present a rigorous study of the\nconvergence and computational issues that arise therein. Our first result is\nstructural and shows that, at any time during the evolution, as the population\nsize tends to infinity, the distribution of genomes predicted by our model\nconverges to that predicted by the quasispecies model. This justifies the\ncontinued use of the quasispecies model to derive guidelines for intervention.\nWhile the stationary state in the quasispecies model is readily obtained, due\nto the explosion of the state space in our model, exact computations are\nprohibitive. Our second set of results are computational in nature and address\nthis issue. We derive conditions on the parameters of evolution under which our\nstochastic model mixes rapidly. Further, for a class of widely used fitness\nlandscapes we give a fast deterministic algorithm which computes the stationary\ndistribution of our model. These computational tools are expected to serve as a\nframework for the modeling of strategies for the deployment of mutagenic drugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 19:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-07"}

Given\nthat such signals are most likely subdominant, the search for pronounced\nspectral features plays a key role for indirect detection experiments;\nmonochromatic gamma-ray lines or similar features related to internal\nbremsstrahlung, in particular, provide smoking gun signatures. We perform a\ndedicated search for the latter in the data taken by the Fermi gamma-ray space\ntelescope during its first 43 months. To this end, we use a new adaptive\nprocedure to select optimal target regions that takes into account both\nstandard and contracted dark matter profiles. The behaviour of our statistical\nmethod is tested by a subsampling analysis of the full sky data and found to\nreproduce the theoretical expectations very well. The limits on the dark matter\nannihilation cross-section that we derive are stronger than what can be\nobtained from the observation of dwarf galaxies and, at least for the model\nconsidered here, collider searches. While these limits are still not quite\nstrong enough to probe annihilation rates expected for thermally produced dark\nmatter, future prospects to do so are very good. In fact, we already find a\nweak indication, with a significance of 3.1\\sigma (4.3\\sigma) when (not) taking\ninto account the look-elsewhere effect, for an internal bremsstrahlung-like\nsignal that would correspond to a dark matter mass of \\sim150 GeV; the same\nsignal is also well fitted by a gamma-ray line at around 130 GeV.

The large\nnumber of these sources suggests that among them there could be a population\nthat significantly contributes to the isotropic gamma-ray background and is\ntherefore crucial to understand their nature. The first step toward a complete\ncomprehension of the unidentified gamma-ray source population is to identify\nthose that can be associated with blazars, the most numerous class of\nextragalactic sources in the gamma-ray sky. Recently, we discovered that\nblazars can be recognized and separated from other extragalactic sources using\nthe infrared (IR) WISE satellite colors. The blazar population delineates a\nremarkable and distinctive region of the IR color-color space, the WISE blazar\nstrip. In particular, the subregion delineated by the gamma-ray emitting\nblazars is even narrower and we named it as the WISE Gamma-ray Strip (WGS). In\nthis paper we parametrize the WGS on the basis of a single parameter s that we\nthen use to determine if gamma-ray Active Galactic Nuclei of the uncertain type\n(AGUs) detected by Fermi are consistent with the WGS and so can be considered\nblazar candidates. We find that 54 AGUs out of a set 60 analyzed have IR colors\nconsistent with the WGS; only 6 AGUs are outliers. This result implies that a\nvery high percentage (i.e., in this sample about 90%) of the AGUs detected by\nFermi are indeed blazar candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 21:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

To increase\nthe realism of existing simulations, we simulated for the first time a disk\ngalaxy exposed to a uniformly magnetized wind including radiative cooling and\nself-gravity of the gas. We find that B-fields have a strong effect on the\nmorphology of the gas in the tail of the galaxy. While in the pure hydro case\nthe tail is very clumpy, the MHD case shows very filamentary structures in the\ntail. The filaments can be strongly supported by magnetic pressure and, when\nthis is the case, the B-field vectors tend to be aligned with the filaments.\nThe ram pressure stripping may lead to the formation of magnetized density\ntails that appear as bifurcated in the plane of the sky and resemble the double\ntails observed in ESO 137-001 and ESO 137-002. Such tails can be formed under a\nvariety of situations, both for the disks oriented face-on with respect to the\nICM wind and for the tilted ones. While this bifurcation is due to the generic\ntendency for the B-fields to produce very filamentary tail morphology, the tail\nproperties are further shaped by the combination of the B-field orientation and\nthe sliding of the field past the disk surface exposed to the wind. Magnetic\ndraping does not strongly change the rate of gas stripping. For a face-on\ngalaxy, the field tends to reduce the amount of stripping compared to the pure\nhydro case, and is associated with the formation of a magnetic draping layer on\nthe side of the galaxy exposed to the ICM wind. For significantly tilted disks,\nthe stripping rate may be enhanced by the ``scraping'' of the disk surface by\nthe B-fields sliding past the ISM/ICM interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 22:18:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 03:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

Despite the\nhuge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual\nanswer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how\nthey may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell\ninequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for\na very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual\nprinciple, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our\nnotion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell\ninequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It\napplies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers\nnot only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly\napplied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There\nis much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach\ndirectly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very\ngeneral notion of contextuality.\n  There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem `without\ninequalities' or `without probabilities'. These proofs are seen as being in a\nsense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On\nthe hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach\nreconciles these aspects, and in fact shows how the logical robustness can be\nconverted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable\nviolations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality\nexhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown\nto lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 23:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 09:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 00:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 22:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 16:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

It is found that EELR phenomenon shows clear\ncorrelation with Eddington ratio, which links EELR to the constituents of the\nprincipal component 1 (PC 1), or eigenvector 1, of the AGN emission\ncorrelations.

Our model\nassumes that early superhumps are caused by the rotation effect of\nnon-axisymmetrically flaring disks. We have developed a Bayesian model for this\nreconstruction, in which a smoother disk-structure tends to have a higher prior\nprobability. We analyzed simultaneous optical and near-infrared photometric\ndata of early superhumps of the dwarf nova, V455 And using this technique. The\nreconstructed disk has two flaring parts in the outermost region of the disk.\nThese parts are responsible for the primary and secondary maxima of the light\ncurves. The height-to-radius ratio is h/r=0.20-0.25 in the outermost region. In\naddition to the outermost flaring structures, flaring arm-like patterns can be\nseen in an inner region of the reconstructed disk. The overall profile of the\nreconstructed disk is reminiscent of the disk structure that is deformed by the\ntidal effect. However, an inner arm-like pattern, which is responsible for the\nsecondary minimum in the light curve, cannot be reproduced only by the tidal\neffect. It implies the presence of another mechanism that deforms the disk\nstructure. Alternatively, the temperature distribution of the disk could be\nnon-axisymmetric. We demonstrate that the disk structure with weaker arm-like\npatterns is optimal in the model including the irradiation effect. However, the\nstrongly irradiated disk gives quite blue colors, which may conflict with the\nobservation. Our results suggest that the amplitude of early superhumps depends\nmainly on the height of the outermost flaring regions of the disk.

In this paper we\ndescribe our work on implementing RBMM for the logic programming language\nMercury. One interesting point about Mercury is that it is designed with strong\ntype, mode, and determinism systems. These systems not only provide Mercury\nprogrammers with several direct software engineering benefits, such as\nself-documenting code and clear program logic, but also give language\nimplementors a large amount of information that is useful for program analyses.\nIn this work, we make use of this information to develop program analyses that\ndetermine the distribution of data into regions and transform Mercury programs\nby inserting into them the necessary region operations. We prove the\ncorrectness of our program analyses and transformation. To execute the\nannotated programs, we have implemented runtime support that tackles the two\nmain challenges posed by backtracking. First, backtracking can require regions\nremoved during forward execution to be \"resurrected\"; and second, any memory\nallocated during a computation that has been backtracked over must be recovered\npromptly and without waiting for the regions involved to come to the end of\ntheir life. We describe in detail our solution of both these problems. We study\nin detail how our RBMM system performs on a selection of benchmark programs,\nincluding some well-known difficult cases for RBMM. Even with these difficult\ncases, our RBMM-enabled Mercury system obtains clearly faster runtimes for 15\nout of 18 benchmarks compared to the base Mercury system with its Boehm runtime\ngarbage collector, with an average runtime speedup of 24%, and an average\nreduction in memory requirements of 95%.

In\nall these examples deformable polymers are subject to various hydrodynamic\nflows and hydrodynamic interactions. Perfect stiff nano-cylinders are known to\nshow no orientational effects as they sediment through a viscous fluid, but it\nis the coupling between elasticity and hydrodynamic torques that leads to an\norientation perpendicular to the direction of sedimentation. Likewise, a\nrotating stiff rod does not lead to a net propulsion in the Stokes limit, but\nif bending is allowed an effective thrust develops whose strength and direction\nis independent of the sense of rotation and thus acts as a rectification\ndevice. Lastly, surface-anchored polymers are deformed by shear flows, which\nmodifies the effective hydrodynamic boundary condition in a non-linear fashion.\nAll these results are obtained with hydrodynamic Brownian dynamics simulation\ntechniques, as appropriate for dilute systems. Scaling analyses are presented\nwhen possible. The common theme is the interaction between elasticity of soft\nmatter and hydrodynamics, which can lead to qualitatively new effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 09:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-08"}

The method is applied\nto find quadratic permutation polynomials (QPP) based interleavers. Compared to\nprevious methods for founding QPP based interleavers, the search complexity is\nreduced, allowing to find interleavers of higher length. This method has been\napplied for QPP interleavers with lengths from the LTE (Long Term Evolution)\nstandard up to 1504. The analyzed classes are those with the largest spread QPP\n(LS-QPP), with the D parameter equal to that of LTE interleaver (D_L_T_E-QPP),\nand the class consisting of all QPP interleavers for lengths up to 1008.

In order to\ncorrectly resemble the realistic case of vertically extended 3D disks the\nsoftening prescription used in 2D needs to be adjusted properly. In this paper\nwe analyze the embedded planet and the self-gravity case and provide a method\nto evaluate the required smoothing in 2D simulations of thin disks. Starting\nfrom the averaged hydrodynamic equations and using a vertically isothermal disk\nmodel, we calculate the force. We compare our results to the often used Plummer\nform of the potential which runs as \\propto 1/(r^2+\\epsilon^2)^{1/2}. For that\npurpose we compute the required smoothing length \\epsilon as a function of\ndistance r to the planet or to a disk element within a self-gravitating disk.\nWe find that for larger distances \\epsilon is determined solely by the vertical\ndisk thickness H. For the planet case we find that outside r\\simH a value of\n\\epsilon = 0.7H describes the averaged force very well, while in the\nself-gravitating disk the value needs to be larger, \\epsilon = 1.2H. For\nsmaller distances the smoothing needs to be reduced significantly. Comparing\ntorque densities of 3D and 2D simulations we show that the modification to the\nvertical density stratification as induced by an embedded planet needs to be\ntaken into account to obtain agreeing results. In disk fragmentation\nsimulations the choice of \\epsilon can determine whether a disk will fragment\nor not. Because a wrong smoothing length can change even the direction of\nmigration, it is very important to include the effect of the planet on the\nlocal scale height in 2D planet-disk simulations. We provide an approximate and\nfast method for this purpose which gives very good agreement to full 3D\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 09:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 09:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}

Simple models of irreversible dynamics on graphs, in which\nnodes activate depending on the state of their neighbors, have been\nsuccessfully applied to describe cascades in a large variety of contexts. Over\nthe last decades, many efforts have been devoted to understand the typical\nbehaviour of the cascades arising from initial conditions extracted at random\nfrom some given ensemble. However, the problem of optimizing the trajectory of\nthe system, i.e. of identifying appropriate initial conditions to maximize (or\nminimize) the final number of active nodes, is still considered to be\npractically intractable, with the only exception of models that satisfy a sort\nof diminishing returns property called submodularity.

We analyze a sample of 183 sunspots observed\nfrom 1999 until 2011 with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter at the German\nVacuum Tower Telescope. The magnetic field strength is derived from the Zeeman\nsplitting of the Stokes-V signal in one near-infrared spectral line, either Fe\nI 1564.8 nm, Fe I 1089.6 nm, or Si I 1082.7 nm. This avoids the effects of the\nunpolarized stray light from the field-free quiet Sun surroundings. The minimum\numbral continuum intensity and umbral area are also measured. We find that\nthere is a systematic trend for sunspots in the late stage of the solar cycle\nno.23 to be weaker, i.e., to have a smaller maximum magnetic field strength\nthan those at the start of the cycle. The decrease in the field strength with\ntime of about 94 G/yr is well beyond the statistical fluctuations that would be\nexpected because of the larger number of sunspots close to cycle maximum (14\nG/yr). In the same time interval, the continuum intensity of the umbra\nincreases with a rate of 1.3 (+- 0.4)% of Ic/yr, while the umbral area does not\nshow any trend above the statistical variance. Sunspots in the new cycle no.24\nshow higher field strengths and lower continuum intensities than those at the\nend of cycle no.23, interrupting the trend. Sunspots have an intrinsically\nweaker field strength and brighter umbrae at the late stages of solar cycles\ncompared to their initial stages, without any significant change in their area.\nThe abrupt increase in field strength in sunspots of the new cycle suggests\nthat the cyclic variations are dominating over any long-term trend that\ncontinues across cycles.

While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN. The possible dip observed in the hydrogen-poor SLSN, 2006oz, could be\nthe first example of this signature and give support to the SN-CSM interaction\nas the power source of SLSN 2006oz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 12:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 18:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

We\npropose a new model to study the self-composition of ABG protocols. The central\ndogma of our approach can be phrased as follows: Consider a player who\ndiligently executes (only) the delegated protocol but the adversary steals some\nprivate information from him. Should such a player be considered faulty? With\nrespect to ABG protocols, we argue that the answer has to be no.\n  In the new model we show that in spite of using unique session identifiers,\nif $n < 2t$, there cannot exist any ABG protocol that composes in parallel even\ntwice. Further, for $n \\geq 2t$, we design ABG protocols that compose for any\nnumber of parallel executions.

We present an adaptation of the Advanced\nThermophysical Model (ATPM) to simultaneously predict the Yarkovsky and YORP\neffects in the presence of thermal-infrared beaming caused by surface\nroughness, which has been neglected or dismissed in all previous models. Tests\non Gaussian random sphere shaped asteroids, and on the real shapes of asteroids\n(1620) Geographos and (6489) Golevka, show that rough surface thermal-infrared\nbeaming enhances the Yarkovsky orbital drift by typically tens of percent but\nit can be as much as a factor of two. The YORP rotational acceleration is on\naverage dampened by up to a third typically but can be as much as one half. We\nfind that the Yarkovsky orbital drift is only sensitive to the average degree,\nand not to the spatial distribution, of roughness across an asteroid surface.\nHowever, the YORP rotational acceleration is sensitive to the surface roughness\nspatial distribution, and can add significant uncertainties to the predictions\nfor asteroids with relatively weak YORP effects. To accurately predict either\neffect the degree and spatial distribution of roughness across an asteroid\nsurface must be known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 13:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We add several pieces of information to\nthe previous merging scenario: the two subclusters (here A1758N(NW) and\nA1758N(SE)) cannot be separated in the velocity analyses and we deduce a small\nLOS velocity difference of ~300 km/s in the cluster rest-frame.

The central problem in TRMC is to decide\nwhether a set of bad states is reachable. The problem of computing a TA\nrepresenting (an over- approximation of) the set of reachable states is\nundecidable, but efficient solutions based on completion or iteration of tree\ntransducers exist. Unfortunately, the TRMC framework is unable to efficiently\ncapture both the complex structure of a system and of some of its features. As\nan example, for JAVA programs, the structure of a term is mainly exploited to\ncapture the structure of a state of the system. On the counter part, integers\nof the java programs have to be encoded with Peano numbers, which means that\nany algebraic operation is potentially represented by thousands of applications\nof rewriting rules.

The branching\nprocess during lung development has been studied in great detail and is\nremarkably stereotyped. The branched tree is generated by the sequential,\nnon-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain\nbranching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation). While many regulatory components\nand local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the\nregulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking. We have\ndeveloped a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of\nthe core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis. The model\nfocuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in\nexperiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well\nas the SHH receptor patched (Ptc). We show that the reported biochemical\ninteractions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that\nallows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.\nThe kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental\ndata where available. The developed model is robust to small absolute and large\nrelative changes in the parameter values. At the same time there is a strong\nregulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be\nachieved by targeted changes in the parameter values. We note that the sequence\nof different branching events may also be the result of different growth\nspeeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours\nbifurcations in our model.

For the studied $^{146}{\\rm Tm}$ nucleus it has been studied the\nfollowing: (1) How much does the magnetic emission change the full\nbremsstrahlung spectrum? (2) At which angle is the magnetic emission the most\nintensive relatively electric one? (3) Is there some space region where the\nmagnetic emission increases strongly relatively electric one? (4) How intensive\nis the magnetic emission in the tunneling region? (5) Which values has the\nprobability at its maximum and at zero energy limit of the emitted photons? It\nis demonstrated that the model is able to describe enough well experimental\ndata of the bremsstrahlung emission which accompanies collisions of protons off\nthe $^{9}{\\rm Be}$, $^{12}{\\rm C}$ and $^{208}{\\rm Pb}$ nuclei at the incident\nenergy $T_{\\rm lab}=140$ MeV (at the photon energy up to 120 MeV).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 15:25:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2012 10:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}
