In this\npaper, we present new Herschel PACS and SPIRE observations of the B59 and Stem\nregions in the Pipe Nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network of\nfilaments. The asymmetric column density profiles observed for several\nfilaments, along with the bow-like edge of B59, indicates that the Pipe Nebula\nis being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from the\nnearby Sco OB2 association. We suggest that this compressive flow has\ncontributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. In\nB59, the only region of the entire Pipe complex showing star formation\nactivity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial column\ndensity of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.\nAlthough more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsible\nfor shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in B59.

Previous radio\nobservations of this compact triplet of galaxies include images at higher\nfrequencies of the radio continuum as well as HI emission, the latter showing\nhuge HI trails originating from the vicinity of NGC 5903 where HI is in a\nkinematically disturbed state. The TGSS 150 MHz image has revealed a large\nasymmetric radio halo around NGC 5903 and also established that the dwarf SO\ngalaxy ESO514-G003 is the host to a previously known bright double radio\nsource. The radio emission from NGC 5903 is found to have a very steep radio\nspectrum ({\\alpha} ~ -1.5) and to envelope a network of radio continuum\nfilaments bearing a spatial relationship to the HI trails. Another noteworthy\naspect of this triplet of early-type galaxies highlighted by the present study\nis that both its radio loud members, namely NGC 5903 and ESO514-G003, are also\nthe only galaxies that are seen to be connected to an HI filament.

The presence of viscosity is generally\nregarded as the condition for such transfer to happen. In this paper, we show\nhow the orbital evolution can cause a persistent torque between the binary\ncomponents, even for inviscid bodies. This preferentially occurs at the final\nstage of coalescence of compact binaries, when the orbit shrinks successively\nby gravitational waves and plunging on a timescale shorter than the viscous\ntimescale. The total orbital energy transferred to the secondary by this torque\nis ~0.01 of its binding energy. We further show that this persistent torque\ninduces a differentially rotating quadrupole perturbation. Specializing to the\ncase of a secondary neutron star, we find that this non equilibrium state has\nan associated free energy of 10^47-10^48 erg, just prior to coalescence. This\nenergy is likely stored in internal fluid motions, with a sizable amount of\ndifferential rotation. By tapping this free energy reservoir, a preexisting\nweak magnetic field could be amplified up to a strength of ~10^15 Gauss.

This follows from the relative inefficiency of AGN\nfeedback on a flattened inflow. We find that even under the most optimistic\nconditions for SMBH feedback on flattened inflows, the mass at which the SMBH\nexpels the gas disc and terminates its own growth is a factor of several higher\nthan the one established for quasi-spherical inflows. Any beaming of feedback\naway from the disc and any disc self-shadowing strengthens this result further.\nContrary to this theoretical expectation, recent observations have shown that\nSMBH in pseudobulge galaxies (which are associated with barred galaxies) are\ntypically under- rather than over-massive when compared with their classical\nbulge counterparts at a fixed value of $\\sigma$.

Instead, there may be additional\nsuppressions hidden in the UV completion of the field theory, which really\ncontrol which light modes can be emitted by the black hole. It could turn out\nthat many degrees of freedom cannot be efficiently emitted by the black hole,\nand so the radiance rate may be much smaller than its estimate based on the\ncounting of the light IR degrees of freedom. If we apply this argument to the\nRS2 brane world, it implies that the emission rates of the low energy CFT modes\nwill be dramatically suppressed: its UV completion is given by the bulk gravity\non $AdS_5 \\times S^5$, and the only bulk modes that could be emitted by a black\nhole are the 4D s-waves of bulk modes with small 5D momentum, or equivalently,\nsmall 4D masses.

We confirm our earlier results based on real z=2 galaxies,\nthat usually adopted \\tau-models lead to overestimate the SFR and to\nunderestimate the stellar mass.

For fitting setups with a\nvariety of SFHs the median mass recovery at z ~ 2-3 is as decent as ~0.1 dex,\nalbeit with large scatter. The situation worsens towards lower redshifts\nbecause of the variety of possible SFHs and ages (~0.6 dex at z=0.5). A\npractical trick to improve upon this is to exclude reddening from the fitting\nto avoid unrealistically young and dusty solutions. Reddening and SFRs should\nthen be determined by a separate fit.

One challenge for measuring the Hubble constant using Classical\nCepheids is the calibration of the Leavitt Law or period-luminosity\nrelationship. The Baade-Wesselink method for distance determination to Cepheids\nrelies on the ratio of the measured radial velocity and pulsation velocity, the\nso-called projection factor and the ability to measure the stellar angular\ndiameters. Aims. We use spherically-symmetric model stellar atmospheres to\nexplore the dependence of the p-factor and angular diameter corrections as a\nfunction of pulsation period. Methods. Intensity profiles are computed from a\ngrid of plane-parallel and spherically-symmetric model stellar atmospheres\nusing the SAtlas code. Projection factors and angular diameter corrections are\ndetermined from these intensity profiles and compared to previous results.\nResults. Our predicted geometric period-projection factor relation including\npreviously published state-of-the-art hydrodynamical predictions is not with\nrecent observational constraints. We suggest a number of potential resolutions\nto this discrepancy. The model atmosphere geometry also affects predictions for\nangular diameter corrections used to interpret interferometric observations,\nsuggesting corrections used in the past underestimated Cepheid angular\ndiameters by 3 - 5%. Conclusions. While spherically-symmetric hydrostatic model\natmospheres cannot resolve differences between projection factors from theory\nand observations, they do help constrain underlying physics that must be\nincluded, including chromospheres and mass loss. The models also predict more\nphysically-based limb-darkening corrections for interferometric observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 20:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It somehow makes a bridge between viscosity\nsolutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Mather invariant sets of\nHamiltonian systems, although this was fully understood only a posteriori.\nThese theories converge under the hypothesis of convexity, and the richness of\napplications mostly comes from this remarkable convergence. In the present\ncourse, we provide an elementary exposition of some of the basic concepts of\nweak KAM theory. In a companion lecture, Albert Fathi exposes the aspects of\nhis theory which are more directly related to viscosity solutions. Here on the\ncontrary, we focus on dynamical applications, even if we also discuss some\nviscosity aspects to underline the connections with Fathi's lecture. The\nfundamental reference on Weak KAM theory is the still unpublished book of\nAlbert Fathi \\textit{Weak KAM theorem in Lagrangian dynamics}. Although we do\nnot offer new results, our exposition is original in several aspects. We only\nwork with the Hamiltonian and do not rely on the Lagrangian, even if some\nproofs are directly inspired from the classical Lagrangian proofs. This\napproach is made easier by the choice of a somewhat specific setting. We work\non $\\Rm^d$ and make uniform hypotheses on the Hamiltonian. This allows us to\nreplace some compactness arguments by explicit estimates. For the most\ninteresting dynamical applications however, the compactness of the\nconfiguration space remains a useful hypothesis and we retrieve it by\nconsidering periodic (in space) Hamiltonians. Our exposition is centered on the\nCauchy problem for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the Lax-Oleinik evolution\noperators associated to it. Dynamical applications are reached by considering\nfixed points of these evolution operators, the Weak KAM solutions. The\nevolution operators can also be used for their regularizing properties, this\nopens a second way to dynamical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 21:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-19"}

In the literature there are available models that link\nthe accretion disk surrounding the neutron star with the amount of material it\nreceives, but there is no model linking the amount of matter lost by the donor\nstar to that falling onto the neutron star.\n  In this paper we explore the evolutionary response of these close binary\nsystems when we vary the amount of material accreted by the neutron star. We\nconsider a parameter \\beta, which represents the fraction of material lost by\nthe normal star that can be accreted by the neutron star. \\beta is considered\nas constant throughout evolution. We have computed the evolution of a set of\nmodels considering initial donor star masses (in solar units) between 0.5 and\n3.50, initial orbital periods (in days) between 0.175 and 12, initial masses of\nneutron stars (in solar units) of 0.80, 1.00, 1.20 and 1.40 and several values\nof beta. We assumed solar abundances. These systems evolve to ultracompact or\nto open binary systems, many of which form low mass helium white dwarfs.

Nowadays, document\nsummarization plays an important role in information retrieval. With a large\nvolume of documents, presenting the user with a summary of each document\ngreatly facilitates the task of finding the desired documents. Document\nsummarization is a process of automatically creating a compressed version of a\ngiven document that provides useful information to users, and multi-document\nsummarization is to produce a summary delivering the majority of information\ncontent from a set of documents about an explicit or implicit main topic. The\nlexical cohesion structure of the text can be exploited to determine the\nimportance of a sentence/phrase. Lexical chains are useful tools to analyze the\nlexical cohesion structure in a text .In this paper we consider the effect of\nthe use of lexical cohesion features in Summarization, And presenting a\nalgorithm base on the knowledge base.

The structure of\nreionization, and hence the observed power spectrum of redshifted 21cm\nfluctuations are known to be sensitive to the astrophysical properties of the\ngalaxies that drove reionization. Thus, detailed measurements of the 21cm power\nspectrum and its evolution could lead to measurements of the properties of\nearly galaxies that are otherwise inaccessible. In this paper, we make\npredictions for the ionised structure during reionization and the 21cm power\nspectrum based on detailed models of galaxy formation. We combine the\nsemi-analytic GALFORM model implemented within the Millennium-II dark matter\nsimulation, with a semi-numerical scheme to describe the resulting ionization\nstructure. Using these models we show that the details of SNe and radiative\nfeedback affect the structure and distribution of ionised regions, and hence\nthe slope and amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum. These results indicate\nthat forthcoming measurements of the 21cm power-spectrum could be used to\nuncover details of early galaxy formation. We find that the strength of SNe\nfeedback is the dominant effect governing the evolution of structure during\nreionization. In particular we show SNe feedback to be more important than\nradiative feedback, the presence of which we find does not influence either the\ntotal stellar mass or overall ionising photon budget. Thus, if SNe feedback is\neffective at suppressing star formation in high redshift galaxies, we find that\nphotoionization feedback does not lead to self-regulation of the reionization\nprocess as has been thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 01:18:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 23:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Very uncertain is still the relative velocity\nregime in which growth rather than destruction can take place. The outcome of a\ncollision depends on the bulk properties of the porous dust agglomerates.\nContinuum models of dust agglomerates require a set of material parameters that\nare often difficult to obtain from laboratory experiments. Here, we aim at\ndetermining those parameters from ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our\ngoal is to improveon the existing model that describe the interaction of\nindividual monomers. We use a molecular dynamics approach featuring a detailed\nmicro-physical model of the interaction of spherical grains. The model includes\nnormal forces, rolling, twisting and sliding between the dust grains. We\npresent a new treatment of wall-particle interaction that allows us to perform\ncustomized simulations that directly correspond to laboratory experiments. We\nfind that the existing interaction model by Dominik & Tielens leads to a too\nsoft compressive strength behavior for uni and omni-directional compression.\nUpon making the rolling and sliding coefficients stiffer we find excellent\nagreement in both cases. Additionally, we find that the compressive strength\ncurve depends on the velocity with which the sample is compressed. The modified\ninteraction strengths between two individual dust grains will lead to a\ndifferent behaviour of the whole dust agglomerate. This will influences the\nsticking probabilities and hence the growth of planetesimals. The new parameter\nset might possibly lead to an enhanced sticking as more energy can be stored in\nthe system before breakup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 08:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-17"}

Recently this\ndecision problem has been shown to be NP-complete by Nichterlein (2011).\nHowever, we can show that several important classes of sequences are\nefficiently solvable.\n  In previous work (Berger and Mueller-Hannemann, FCT2011), we have proved that\nyes-instances always have a special kind of topological order which allows us\nto reduce the number of possible topological orderings in most cases\ndrastically. This leads to an exact exponential-time algorithm which\nsignificantly improves upon a straightforward approach. Moreover, a combination\nof this exponential-time algorithm with a special strategy gives a linear-time\nalgorithm. Interestingly, in systematic experiments we observed that we could\nsolve a huge majority of all instances by the linear-time heuristic. This\nmotivates us to develop characteristics like dag density and \"distance to\nprovably easy sequences\" which can give us an indicator how easy or difficult a\ngiven sequence can be realized.\n  Furthermore, we propose a randomized algorithm which exploits our structural\ninsight on topological sortings and uses a number of reduction rules. We\nobserve that it clearly outperforms all other variants and behaves surprisingly\nwell for almost all instances. Another striking observation is that our simple\nlinear-time algorithm solves a set of real-world instances from different\ndomains, namely ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs), train and flight\nschedules, as well as instances derived from food-web networks without any\nexception.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 08:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-19"}

We want to verify to what extent\nupper limits from direct imaging do indeed constrain the microlensing results.\nWe examine the current derivation of the upper limits used in the microlensing\nstudy and re-analyze the data from the corresponding imaging survey.

We also consider new results from a recent M-dwarf\nimaging survey as these objects are typically the host stars for planets\ndetected by microlensing. We find that the upper limits currently applied in\ncontext of the microlensing results are probably underestimated. This means\nthat a larger fraction of stars than assumed may harbor gas giant planets at\nlarger orbital separations. Also, the way the upper limit is currently used to\nestimate the fraction of free-floating objects is not strictly correct. If the\nplanetary surface density of giant planets around M-dwarfs is described as\ndf_Planet ~ a^beta da, we find that beta ~ 0.5 - 0.6 is consistent with results\nfrom different observational studies probing semi-major axes between ~0.03 - 30\nAU. Having a higher upper limit on the fraction of stars that may have gas\ngiant planets at orbital separations probed by the microlensing data implies\nthat more of the planets detected in the microlensing study are potentially\nbound to stars rather than free-floating.

The resulting spacetime may be\nstatistically uniform on average, or have random, non-repeating variation. The\nconstruction utilises the Darmois junction conditions to join many different\ncomponent spacetime regions. In the initial simple example given, the component\nparts are spatially flat and uniform, but much more general combinations should\nbe possible. Further inhomogeneity may be added via swiss cheese vacuoles and\ninhomogeneous metrics. This model is used to explore the proposal, that\nobservers are located in bound, non-expanding regions, while the universe is\nactually in the process of becoming void dominated, and thus its average\nexpansion rate is increasing. The model confirms qualitatively that the faster\nexpanding components come to dominate the average, and that inhomogeneity\nresults in average parameters which evolve differently from those of any one\ncomponent, but more realistic modelling of the effect will need this\nconstruction to be generalised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 09:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-19"}

To tackle this problem, sufficient dimension reduction aims to\nestimate the central subspace (CS), in which all the necessary information\nsupplied by the covariates regarding the response of interest is contained.\nSubsequent statistical analysis can then be made in a lower-dimensional space\nwhile preserving relevant information. Oftentimes studies are interested in a\ncertain transformation of the response (the induced response), instead of the\noriginal one, whose corresponding CS may vary. When estimating the CS of the\ninduced response, existing dimension reduction methods may, however, suffer the\nproblem of inefficiency. In this article, we propose a more efficient two-stage\nestimation procedure to estimate the CS of an induced response. This approach\nis further extended to the case of censored responses. An application for\ncombining multiple biomarkers is also illustrated. Simulation studies and two\ndata examples provide further evidence of the usefulness of the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 10:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-19"}

Our results provide coherence for all\nreasonable extensions to tricategories of Quillen's definition of the\n'classifying space' of a category as the geometric realization of the\ncategory's Grothendieck nerve. Many properties of the classifying space\nconstruction for tricategories may be easier to establish depending on the\nnerve used for realizations. For instance, by using Grothendieck nerves we\nstate and prove the precise form in which the process of taking classifying\nspaces transports tricategorical coherence to homotopy coherence. Segal nerves\nallow us to obtain an extension to bicategories of the results by Mac Lane,\nStasheff, and Fiedorowicz about the relation between loop spaces and monoidal\nor braided monoidal categories by showing that the group completion of the\nclassifying space of a bicategory enriched with a monoidal structure is, in a\nprecise way, a loop space.

When\nwalls are sheared very slowly, only two or three crystalline layers next to the\nwalls move along with them, while the inner layers of the crystal are only\nslightly tilted. At higher shear velocities, this inner part of the crystal\nbreaks into several pieces with different orientations. The velocity profile\nacross the slit is reminiscent of shear-banding in flowing soft materials,\nwhere liquid and solid regions coexist; the difference, however, is that in the\nlatter case the solid regions are glassy while here they are crystalline. At\neven higher shear velocities, the effect of the shearing becomes smaller again.\nAlso the effective temperature near the walls (deduced from the velocity\ndistributions of the particles) decreases again when the wall velocity gets\nvery large. When the walls are placed closer together, thereby introducing a\nmisfit, a structure containing a soliton staircase arises in simulations\nwithout shear. Introducing shear increases the disorder in these systems until\nno solitons are visible any more. Instead, similar structures like in the case\nwithout misfit result.

This estimates the probability of future attacks as a\nfunction of the times since the past attacks. In addition, the excess of\nnonattack days coupled with the presence of multiple coordinated attacks on the\nsame day compelled the use of hurdle models to jointly model the probability of\nan attack day and corresponding number of attacks.

The\ntechnique is based on local modification of variables (replacing X by aX or Xa)\nand iterative replacement of pairs of letters appearing in the equation by a\n`fresh' letter, which can be seen as a bottom-up compression of the solution of\nthe given word equation, to be more specific, building an SLP (Straight-Line\nProgramme) for the solution of the word equation.\n  Using this technique we give a new, independent and self-contained proofs of\nmost of the known results for word equations. To be more specific, the\npresented (nondeterministic) algorithm runs in O(n log n) space and in time\npolynomial in log N, where N is the size of the length-minimal solution of the\nword equation. The presented algorithm can be easily generalised to a generator\nof all solutions of the given word equation (without increasing the space\nusage). Furthermore, a further analysis of the algorithm yields a doubly\nexponential upper bound on the size of the length-minimal solution. The\npresented algorithm does not use exponential bound on the exponent of\nperiodicity. Conversely, the analysis of the algorithm yields an independent\nproof of the exponential bound on exponent of periodicity.\n  We believe that the presented algorithm, its idea and analysis are far\nsimpler than all previously applied. Furthermore, thanks to it we can obtain a\nunified and simple approach to most of known results for word equations.\n  As a small additional result we show that for O(1) variables (with arbitrary\nmany appearances in the equation) word equations can be solved in linear space,\ni.e. they are context-sensitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 13:43:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 10:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 12:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

The description given is\nsimple in that the effect of large-scale structures is limited to a\nquasi-steady response of the near-wall turbulence to slow large-scale\nfluctuations of the skin friction. The most natural and compact form of\nexpressing this mechanism is given by the usual Reynolds-number-independent\nrepresentation of the total skin friction and velocity, scaled in wall\nvariables, where the mean quantities are replaced by large-scale\nlow-pass-filtered fluctuating components. The theory is rewritten in terms of\nfuctuations via a universal mean velocity and random mean square fluctuation\nvelocity profiles of the small-scales and then linearised assuming that the\nlarge-scale fluctuations are small as compared to the mean components.

We prove that besides Dirac's infinite families\nof graphs and four infinite families of non-regular matroids determined by\nOxley, there are only three possibilities for a matroid in this class: it is\nisomorphic to the dual of the generalized parallel connection of $F_7$ with\nitself across a triangle with an element of the triangle deleted; it's rank is\nbounded by 5; or it admits a non-minimal exact 3-separation induced by the\n3-separation in $P_9$.

Usually the process of (automatically)\ndefining the roles in a bottom up way, starting from the permissions assigned\nto each user, is called {\\it role mining}. In literature, the role mining\nproblem has been formally analyzed and several techniques have been proposed in\norder to obtain a set of valid roles.\n  Recently, the problem of defining different kind of constraints on the number\nand the size of the roles included in the resulting role set has been\naddressed. In this paper we provide a formal definition of the role mining\nproblem under the cardinality constraint, i.e. restricting the maximum number\nof permissions that can be included in a role.
