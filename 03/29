Extended [CII] emission and more\ncompact CO-emission was found in the globule. We ascribe this emission mainly\nto an internal PDR, created by a possibly embedded star-cluster with at least\none early B-star.

The velocity-resolved [CII]\nemission traces the emission of PDR surfaces, possible rotation of the globule,\nand high-velocity outflowing gas. The globule shows a velocity shift of ~2 km/s\nwith respect to the expanding HII-region, which can be understood as the\nresidual turbulence of the molecular cloud from which the globule arose. This\nscenario is compatible with recent numerical simulations that emphazise the\neffect of turbulence.

Approximately one third (28-37%) of individual\nstars in multiples have detectable millimeter emission, a rate half that for\nsingle stars (~62%). There is a strong correlation between the luminosity and\nprojected separation (a_p) of a stellar pair. Wide pairs (a_p > 300 AU) have a\nsimilar luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (a_p ~ 30-300 AU)\nare a factor of 5 fainter, and close pairs (a_p < 30 AU) are ~ 5 times fainter\nyet (aside from a small population of bright circumbinary disks).

A direct comparison of resolved disk sizes with predictions\nfrom tidal truncation models yields mixed results; some disks are larger than\nexpected given their companion separations. We suggest that the presence of a\nstellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the internal\nevolution mechanisms operating in isolated systems, with both the multiple star\nformation process itself and star-disk tidal interactions likely playing\nimportant roles in the evolution of disk material.

The former is able to explain the detected signal of G2 in the\nposition-velocity diagram of the Br gamma emission of the year 2008.5 and\n2011.5 data.

As a string/unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads,\nsuch a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a\nlossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on\nwhole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion\n(INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs.\n  Results: To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context\nof resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles\nIllumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the\ninput reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a\nreference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we\nshowed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar\naccuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher\nsensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our\nwork suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly be a beneficial\ncomplement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome\nresequencing.

In\nthe former, $b$ quarks appear only in the final state and are typically\nconsidered massive. In 5-flavor schemes, calculations include $b$ quarks in the\ninitial state, are simpler and allow the resummation of possibly large initial\nstate logarithms of the type $\\log \\frac{{\\cal Q}^2}{m_b^2}$ into the $b$\nparton distribution function (PDF), ${\\cal Q}$ being the typical scale of the\nhard process. In this work we critically reconsider the rationale for using\n5-flavor improved schemes at the LHC. Our motivation stems from the observation\nthat the effects of initial state logs are rarely very large in hadron\ncollisions: 4-flavor computations are pertubatively well behaved and a\nsubstantial agreement between predictions in the two schemes is found. We\nidentify two distinct reasons that explain this behaviour, i.e., the\nresummation of the initial state logarithms into the $b$-PDF is relevant only\nat large Bjorken $x$ and the possibly large ratios ${\\cal Q}^2/m_b^2$'s are\nalways accompanied by universal phase space suppression factors. Our study\npaves the way to using both schemes for the same process so to exploit their\ncomplementary advantages for different observables, such as employing a\n5-flavor scheme to accurately predict the total cross section at NNLO and the\ncorresponding 4-flavor computation at NLO for fully exclusive studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 22:52:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 15:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 10:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

To\naccomplish this, we derive lower bounds on the mutual information rate between\nthe transmitted and received sequences (for the original channel) for an\narbitrary input distribution, and then relate this result to the channel\ncapacity. The results apply without the knowledge of the exact capacity\nachieving input distributions. A primary application of our results is that we\ncan employ any lower bound derived on the capacity of the first channel\n(synchronization error channel in the decomposition) to find lower bounds on\nthe capacity of the (original) noisy channel with synchronization errors. We\napply the general ideas to several specific classes of channels such as\nsynchronization error channels with erasures and substitutions, with symmetric\nq-ary outputs and with AWGN explicitly, and obtain easy-to-compute bounds. We\nillustrate that, with our approach, it is possible to derive tighter capacity\nlower bounds compared to the currently available bounds in the literature for\ncertain classes of channels, e.g., deletion/substitution channels and\ndeletion/AWGN channels (for certain signal to noise ratio (SNR) ranges).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 23:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-30"}

A prominent example is the binary\nblack hole problem within Einstein's theory of gravitation, in which one\ncomputes the gravitational radiation emitted from the inspiral of the two black\nholes, merger and ringdown. Powerful mathematical tools can be used to\nestablish qualitative statements about the solutions, such as their existence,\nuniqueness, continuous dependence on the initial data, or their asymptotic\nbehavior over large time scales. However, one is often interested in computing\nthe solution itself, and unless the partial differential equation is very\nsimple, or the initial data possesses a high degree of symmetry, this\ncomputation requires approximation by numerical discretization. When solving\nsuch discrete problems on a machine, one is faced with a finite limit to\ncomputational resources, which leads to the replacement of the infinite\ncontinuum domain with a finite computer grid. This, in turn, leads to a\ndiscrete initial-boundary value problem.

Our X-ray timing analysis finds the source rotating with a period\nof P=8.43772016(2) s and a period derivative \\dot{P}=8.3(2)x10^{-14} s s^{-1} ,\nwhich entails an inferred dipolar surface magnetic field of B~2.7x10^{13} G at\nthe equator. This measurement makes Swift J1822.3-1606 the second lowest\nmagnetic field magnetar (after SGR 0418+5729; Rea et al. 2010). Following the\nflux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst, we find that\nthe flux decreased by about an order of magnitude, with a subtle softening of\nthe spectrum, both typical of the outburst decay of magnetars. By modeling the\nsecular thermal evolution of Swift J1822.3-1606, we find that the observed\ntiming properties of the source, as well as its quiescent X-ray luminosity, can\nbe reproduced if it was born with a poloidal and crustal toroidal fields of\nB_{p}~1.5x10^{14} G and B_{tor}~7x10^{14} G, respectively, and if its current\nage is ~550 kyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 07:27:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 20:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The UC HII Mon R2 is the\nclosest one and therefore an excellent target to study the chemistry in these\ncomplex regions.\n  We carried out a 3mm and 1mm spectral survey using the IRAM 30-m telescope\ntowards three positions that represent different physical environments in Mon\nR2: (i) the ionization front (IF) at (0\",0\"); two peaks in the molecular cloud\n(ii) MP1 at the offset (+15\",-15\") and (iii) MP2 at the farther offset\n(0\",40\"). In addition, we carried out extensive modeling to explain the\nchemical differences between the three observed regions.\n  We detected more than thirty different species. We detected SO+ and C4H\nsuggesting that UV radiation plays an important role in the molecular chemistry\nof this region. We detected the typical PDR molecules CN, HCN, HCO, C2H, and\nc-C3H2. While the IF and the MP1 have a chemistry similar to that found in high\nUV field and dense PDRs like the Orion Bar, the MP2 is more similar to lower\nUV/density PDRs like the Horsehead nebula.\n  We also detected complex molecules that are not usually found in PDRs (CH3CN,\nH2CO, HC3N, CH3OH and CH3C2H). Sulfur compounds CS, HCS+, C2S, H2CS, SO and SO2\nand the deuterated species DCN and C2D were also identified. [DCN]/[HCN]=0.03\nand [C2D]/[C2H]=0.05, are among the highest in warm regions.\n  Our results show that the high UV/dense PDRs present a different chemistry\nfrom that of the low UV case. Abundance ratios like [CO+]/[HCO+] or\n[HCO]/[HCO+] are good diagnostics to differentiate between them. In Mon R2 we\nhave the two classes of PDRs, a high UV PDR towards the IF and the adjacent\nmolecular bar and a low-UV PDR which extends towards the north-west following\nthe border of the cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 08:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

However, hydrodynamic\nmodels including radiation and gravity show that UV-illumination has little or\nno impact on the global dynamical evolution of the cloud. The Rosette molecular\ncloud, irradiated by the NGC2244 cluster, is a template region for triggered\nstar-formation, and we investigated its spatial and density structure by\napplying a curvelet analysis, a filament-tracing algorithm (DisPerSE), and\nprobability density functions (PDFs) on Herschel column density maps, obtained\nwithin the HOBYS key program. The analysis reveals not only the filamentary\nstructure of the cloud but also that all known infrared clusters except one lie\nat junctions of filaments, as predicted by turbulence simulations. The PDFs of\nsub-regions in the cloud show systematic differences. The two UV-exposed\nregions have a double-peaked PDF we interprete as caused by shock compression.\nThe deviations of the PDF from the log-normal shape typically associated with\nlow- and high-mass star-forming regions at Av~3-4m and 8-10m, respectively, are\nfound here within the very same cloud. This shows that there is no fundamental\ndifference in the density structure of low- and high-mass star-forming regions.\nWe conclude that star-formation in Rosette - and probably in high-mass\nstar-forming clouds in general - is not globally triggered by the impact of\nUV-radiation. Moreover, star formation takes place in filaments that arose from\nthe primordial turbulent structure built up during the formation of the cloud.\nClusters form at filament mergers, but star formation can be locally induced in\nthe direct interaction zone between an expanding HII--region and the molecular\ncloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 09:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We restrict our study to regularly arranged distributions of masses\nin topological 3-spheres. This has the benefit of allowing straightforward\ncomparisons to be made with FLRW solutions, as both spacetimes admit a discrete\ngroup of symmetries. It also provides a time-symmetric hypersurface at the\nmoment of maximum expansion that allows the constraint equations to be solved\nexactly. We find that when all the mass in the universe is condensed into a\nsmall number of objects (<10) then the amount of backreaction in dust models\ncan be large, with O(1) deviations from the predictions of the corresponding\nFLRW solutions. When the number of masses is large (>100), however, then our\nmeasures of backreaction become small (<1%).

We identify,\ncharacterize, and mitigate the impact of sources of systematic uncertainty on\nlarge-scale clustering measurements, both for angular moments of the\nredshift-space correlation function and the spherically averaged power\nspectrum, P(k), in order to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will be\nobtained from these data. A correlation between the projected density of stars\nand the higher redshift (0.43 < z < 0.7) galaxy sample (the `CMASS' sample) due\nto imaging systematics imparts a systematic error that is larger than the\nstatistical error of the clustering measurements at scales s > 120h^-1Mpc or k\n< 0.01hMpc^-1.

In this paper, we use a sample of 43 Swift bursts to investigate\nwhether this relation depends on redshift. Both the z-correction and the\nk-correction are taken into account. Our analysis consists of binning the data\nin redshift, z, then applying a fit of the form: log(L) = A +\nBlog(tau_lag0/<tau_lag0>) for each bin, where tau_lag0 is the time-lag in the\nburst's source frame, and <tau_lag0> is the corresponding mean value for the\nentire sample.

Finally, in order to get a more realistic distribution of\nconductivity, notably by removing negative conductivity values, we suggest an\nadditional recursive filter based upon the inversion of the logarithm of the\nconductivity.
