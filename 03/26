Concerning the appearance of the Bose-Einstein Condensation, the\nresults are surprisingly in accordance with the previous ones, despite the lack\nof amenability. We indeed first show the following fact. Even when the critical\ndensity is finite (which is implied in all the models under consideration,\nthanks to the appearance of the hidden spectrum), if the adjacency operator of\nthe graph is recurrent, it is impossible to exhibit temperature locally normal\nstates (i.e. states for which the local particle density is finite) describing\nthe condensation at all. The same occurs in the transient cases for which it is\nimpossible to exhibit locally normal states describing the Bose--Einstein\nCondensation at mean particle density strictly greater than the critical\ndensity . In addition, for the transient cases, in order to construct locally\nnormal temperature states through infinite volume limits of finite volume Gibbs\nstates, a careful choice of the the sequence of the finite volume chemical\npotential should be done. For all such states, the condensate is essentially\nallocated on the base--point supporting the perturbation. This leads that the\nparticle density always coincide with the critical one.

In\naddition to the shock formed towards the star, the shocked and unshocked\ncomponents of the pulsar wind flowing away from the star terminate by means of\nadditional strong shocks produced by the orbital motion. Strong instabilities\nlead to the development of turbulence and an effective two-wind mixing in both\nthe leading and trailing sides of the interaction structure, which starts to\nmerge with itself after one orbit.

Five of these are spectroscopically\nconfirmed to be heavily reddened Type 1 AGN with broad emission lines bringing\nour total sample of reddened quasars from the UKIDSS-LAS to 12 at z=1.4-2.7. At\nthese redshifts, Ha (6563A) is in the K-band. However, the mean Ha equivalent\nwidth of the reddened quasars is only ten per cent larger than that of the\noptically selected population and cannot explain the extreme colours. Instead,\ndust extinction of Av~2-6 mags is required to reproduce the continuum colours\nof our sources. This is comparable to the dust extinctions seen in\nsubmillimetre galaxies at similar redshifts. We argue that the AGN are likely\nbeing observed in a relatively short-lived breakout phase when they are\nexpelling gas and dust following a massive starburst, subsequently turning into\nUV-luminous quasars. Some of our quasars show direct evidence for strong\noutflows (v~800-1000 km/s) affecting the Ha line consistent with this scenario.\nWe predict that a larger fraction of reddened quasar hosts are likely to be\nsubmillimetre bright compared to the UV-luminous quasar population. We use our\nsample to place new constraints on the fraction of obscured Type 1 AGN likely\nto be missed in optical surveys. Taken at face-value our findings suggest that\nthe obscured fraction depends on quasar luminosity. The space density of\nobscured quasars is ~5x that inferred for UV-bright quasars from the SDSS\nluminosity function at Mi<-30 but seems to drop at lower luminosities even\naccounting for various sources of incompleteness in our sample (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2012 18:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 10:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 09:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Eccentric, Jupiter-sized planets are particularly\ninteresting: they may link the \"cold\" Jupiters beyond the ice line to close-in\nhot Jupiters, which are unlikely to have formed in situ. To date,\neccentricities of individual transiting planets primarily come from radial\nvelocity measurements. Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting Jupiters\nspanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludes\nradial velocity follow-up of most. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian method of\nmeasuring an individual planet's eccentricity solely from its transit light\ncurve using prior knowledge of its host star's density. We show that eccentric\nJupiters are readily identified by their short ingress/egress/total transit\ndurations -- part of the \"photoeccentric\" light curve signature of a planet's\neccentricity --- even with long-cadence Kepler photometry and\nloosely-constrained stellar parameters. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration\nof parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and\nautomatically accounts for the transit probability. To demonstrate, we use\nthree published transit light curves of HD 17156 b to measure an eccentricity\nof e = 0.71 +0.16/-0.09, in good agreement with the discovery value e =\n0.67+/-0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements.

In theory, the PNLF method should not work at\nall, since the luminosities of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) should be\nhighly sensitive to the age of their host stellar population. Yet the method\nappears robust, as it consistently produces < 10% distances to galaxies of all\nHubble types, from the earliest ellipticals to the latest-type spirals and\nirregulars. It is therefore uniquely suited for cross-checking the results of\nother techniques and finding small offsets between the Population I and\nPopulation II distance ladders. We review the calibration of the method and\nshow that the zero points provided by Cepheids and the Tip of the Red Giant\nBranch are in excellent agreement. We then compare the results of the PNLF with\nthose from Surface Brightness Fluctuation measurements, and show that, although\nboth techniques agree in a relative sense, the latter method yields distances\nthat are ~15% larger than those from the PNLF. We trace this discrepancy back\nto the calibration galaxies and argue that, due to a small systematic error\nassociated with internal reddening, the true distance scale likely falls\nbetween the extremes of the two methods.

We identified a process \"ground state alignment\" as a new way to\ndetermine the magnetic field direction in diffuse medium. The alignment is due\nto anisotropic radiation impinging on the atom/ion, while the magnetic field\ninduces precession and realign the atom/ion and therefore the polarization of\nthe emitted or absorbed radiation reflects the direction of the magnetic field.\nThe atoms get aligned at their low levels and, as the life-time of the\natoms/ions we deal with is long, the alignment induced by anisotropic radiation\nis susceptible to weak magnetic fields ($1{\\rm G}\\gtrsim B\\gtrsim 10^{-15}$G).\nCompared to the upper level Hanle effect, atomic realignment is most suitable\nfor the studies of magnetic field in the diffuse medium, where magnetic field\nis relatively weak. In fact, the effects of atomic/ionic alignment, including\nthe realignment in magnetic field, were studied in the laboratory decades ago,\nmostly in relation to the maser research.

The main contributions of the paper are graph-theoretic\ncharacterizations of the structural controllability for multi-agent systems. It\nturns out that the multi-agent system with switching topology is structurally\ncontrollable if and only if the union graph G of the underlying communication\ntopologies is connected (single leader) or leader-follower connected\n(multi-leader). Finally, the paper concludes with several illustrative examples\nand discussions of the results and future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 05:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-27"}

Multi-wavelength studies were performed combining\noptical absorption line data of CaII and NaI with follow-up HI 21-cm emission\nline observations along 408 sight lines towards low- and high-redshift QSOs. We\nmade use of archival optical spectra obtained with UVES/VLT. HI data were\nextracted from the Effelsberg-Bonn HI survey and the Galactic All-Sky survey.\nFor selected sight lines we obtained deeper follow-up observations using the\nEffelsberg 100-m telescope. CaII (NaI) halo absorbers at intermediate and high\nradial velocities are present in 40-55% (20-35%) of the sightlines, depending\non the column density threshold chosen. Many halo absorbers show\nmulti-component absorption lines, indicating the presence of sub-structure. In\n65% of the cases, absorption is associated with HI 21-cm emission. The CaII\n(NaI) column density distribution function follows a power-law with a slope of\n-2.2 (-1.4). Our absorption-selected survey confirms our previous results that\nthe Milky Way halo is filled with a large number of neutral gas structures\nwhose high column density tail represents the population of common HI high- and\nintermediate-velocity clouds seen in 21-cm observations. We find that CaII/NaI\ncolumn density ratios in the halo absorbers are typically smaller than those in\nthe Milky Way disc, in the gas in the Magellanic Clouds, and in damped\nLyman-alpha systems. The small ratios (prominent in particular in high-velocity\ncomponents) indicate a lower level of Ca depletion onto dust grains in Milky\nWay halo absorbers compared to gas in discs and inner regions of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 08:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

These data have been searched for GWs\nemitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotating\nneutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of the\ndetectors. The sensitivity of GW searches is limited by noise produced by the\ndetector or its environment. It is therefore crucial to characterize the\nvarious noise sources in a GW detector. This paper reviews the Virgo detector\nnoise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which were\nidentified in the three first Virgo observing runs. In many cases, these\ninvestigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or to\nselectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. We present\nexamples from the joint LIGO-GEO-Virgo GW searches to show how well noise\ntransients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from the\nVirgo data. We also discuss how detector characterization can improve the\nastrophysical reach of gravitational-wave searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 09:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 13:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The Antarctic plateau is recognized to be an ideal\nsite for mm and sub-mm observations, and the French/Italian base of Dome C is\namong the best sites on Earth for these observations. In this paper we present\nmeasurements, performed using the BRAIN-pathfinder experiment, at Dome C of the\natmospheric emission in intensity and polarization at 150GHz, one of the best\nobservational frequencies for CMB observations when considering cosmic signal\nintensity, atmospheric transmission, detectors sensitivity, and foreground\nremoval. Careful characterization of the air-mass synchronous emission has been\nperformed, acquiring more that 380 elevation scans (i.e. \"skydip\") during the\nthird BRAIN-pathfinder summer campaign in December 2009/January 2010. The\nextremely high transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere over Dome Concordia is\nproven by the very low measured optical depth: <tau_I>=0.050 \\pm 0.003 \\pm\n0.011 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic error.\nMid term stability, over the summer campaign, of the atmosphere emission has\nalso been studied. Adapting the radiative transfer atmosphere emission model\n\"am\" to the particular conditions found at Dome C, we also infer the level of\nthe PWV content of the atmosphere, notoriously the main source of disturbance\nin millimetric astronomy (<PWV>=0.77 +/- 0.06 + 0.15 - 0.12 mm). Upper limits\non the air-mass correlated polarized signal are also placed for the first time.\nThe degree of circular polarization of atmospheric emission is found to be\nlower than 0.2% (95%CL), while the degree of linear polarization is found to be\nlower than 0.1% (95%CL). These limits include signal-correlated instrumental\nspurious polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 09:56:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 11:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The reason is the lack of information about magnon\ninteractions and of reliable methods to obtain it, in particular for electrical\nconductors because of the intricate influence of electrons.

The\nposition variance as a measure of quantum walk starts oscillating from the\nfirst several steps and tends to be linear on time and showing a diffusive\nspread in the long time limit, which is caused by the non-Markovian dephasing\naffecting on quantum correlations between quantum walker and his coin.

In an extension\nof the concept of Lopatinski and Shapiro, it associates to each operator two\nsymbols: a pseudodifferential principal symbol, which is a bundle homomorphism,\nand an operator-valued boundary symbol. Ellipticity requires the invertibility\nof both. If the underlying manifold is compact, elliptic elements define\nFredholm operators. Boutet de Monvel showed how then the index can be computed\nin topological terms. The crucial observation is that elliptic operators can be\nmapped to compactly supported $K$-theory classes on the cotangent bundle over\nthe interior of the manifold. The Atiyah-Singer topological index map, applied\nto this class, then furnishes the index of the operator. Based on this result,\nFedosov, Rempel-Schulze and Grubb have given index formulas in terms of the\nsymbols.

This equation is a\nsimplemodel for the circulation of currents in closed basins, the variables$x$\nand $y$ being respectively the longitude and the latitude. A crudeanalysis\nshows that as $\\mathfrak{E} \\to 0$, the weak limit of $\\psi$ satisfiesthe\nso-called Sverdrup transport equation inside the domain, namely$\\partial\\_x\n\\psi^0=\\tau$, while boundary layers appear in the vicinity ofthe boundary.These\nboundary layers, which are the main center of interest of thepresent paper,\nexhibit several types of peculiar behaviour. First, thesize of the boundary\nlayer on the western and eastern boundary, whichhad already been computed by\nseveral authors, becomes formally verylarge as one approaches northern and\nsouthern portions of the boudary,i.e. pieces of the boundary on which the\nnormal is vertical. Thisphenomenon is known as geostrophic degeneracy. In order\nto avoid suchsingular behaviour, previous studies imposed restrictive\nassumptionson the domain $\\Omega$ and on the forcing term $\\tau$. Here, we\nprovethat a superposition of two boundary layers occurs in the vicinity ofsuch\npoints: the classical western or eastern boundary layers, andsome northern or\nsouthern boundary layers, whose mathematicalderivation is completely new. The\nsize of northern/southern boundarylayers is much larger than the one of western\nboundary layers($\\mathfrak{E}^{1/4}$ vs. $\\mathfrak{E}^{1/3}$). We explain in\ndetail how the superpositiontakes place, depending on the geometry of the\nboundary.Moreover, when the domain $\\Omega$ is not connex in the $x$\ndirection,$\\psi^0$ is not continuous in $\\Omega$, and singular layers appear\ninorder to correct its discontinuities. These singular layers areconcentrated\nin the vicinity of horizontal lines, and thereforepenetrate the interior of the\ndomain $\\Omega$. Hence we exhibit some kindof boundary layer separation.\nHowever, we emphasize that we remainable to prove a convergence theorem, so\nthat the singular layerssomehow remain stable, in spite of the\nseparation.Eventually, the effect of boundary layers is non-local in\nseveralaspects.

We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a\nmismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the\nmass of the parent stellar population. Because too much mass is heated, the\ntemperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic\narguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical\nresolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected\nthermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose\nand test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum\ntemperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both\nparticle- and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nsimulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark\nmatter haloes with total mass 10^10 and 10^12 h^-1 solar masses. The thermal\nfeedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive,\nlarge-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling\ntemporarily.

Correlations in the statistics of neural spike trains also\narise as the effect of interaction between neurons. Here we show that these two\nsituations can be distinguished, with machine learning techniques, provided the\ndata are rich enough. In order to do this, we study the problem of inferring a\nkinetic Ising model, stationary or nonstationary, from the available data. We\napply the inference procedure to two data sets: one from salamander retinal\nganglion cells and the other from a realistic computational cortical network\nmodel. We show that many aspects of the concerted activity of the salamander\nretinal neurons can be traced simply to the external input. A model of\nnon-interacting neurons subject to a non-stationary external field outperforms\na model with stationary input with couplings between neurons, even accounting\nfor the differences in the number of model parameters. When couplings are added\nto the non-stationary model, for the retinal data, little is gained: the\ninferred couplings are generally not significant. Likewise, the distribution of\nthe sizes of sets of neurons that spike simultaneously and the frequency of\nspike patterns as function of their rank (Zipf plots) are well-explained by an\nindependent-neuron model with time-dependent external input, and adding\nconnections to such a model does not offer significant improvement.

An\naspect of graph algorithms that has hitherto not received much interest is the\neffect of memory hierarchy on accesses. A typical system today has multiple\nlevels in the memory hierarchy with differing units of locality; ranging across\ncache lines, TLB entries and DRAM pages. We postulate that it is possible to\nallocate graph structured data in main memory in a way as to improve the\nspatial locality of the data. Previous approaches to improving cache locality\nhave focused only on a single unit of locality, either the cache line or\nvirtual memory page. On the other hand cache oblivious algorithms can optimise\nlayout for all levels of the memory hierarchy but unfortunately need to be\nspecially designed for individual data structures. In this paper we explore\nhierarchical blocking as a technique for closing this gap. We require as input\na specification of the units of locality in the memory hierarchy and lay out\nthe input graph accordingly by copying its nodes using a hierarchy of breadth\nfirst searches. We start with a basic algorithm that is limited to trees and\nthen extend it to arbitrary graphs. Our most efficient version requires only a\nconstant amount of additional space. We have implemented versions of the\nalgorithm in various environments: for C programs interfaced with macros, as an\nextension to the Boost object oriented graph library and finally as a\nmodification to the traversal phase of the semispace garbage collector in the\nJikes Java virtual machine.

The aim is a complete description of particle\nproduction at all transverse momentum ($p_{t}$) scales. In this picture, the\nhard initial scatterings result in mainly longitudinal flux tubes, with\ntransversely moving pieces carrying the $p_{t}$ of the partons from hard\nscatterings. These flux tubes constitute eventually both bulk matter (which\nthermalizes and flows) and jets. We introduce a criterion based on parton\nenergy loss to decide whether a given string segment contributes to the bulk or\nleaves the matter to end up as a jet of hadrons. Essentially low $p_{t}$\nsegments from inside the volume will constitute the bulk, high $p_{t}$ segments\n(or segments very close to the surface) contribute to the jets. The latter ones\nappear after the usual flux tube breaking via q-qbar production (Schwinger\nmechanism). Interesting is the transition region: Intermediate $p_{t}$ segments\nproduced inside the matter close to the surface but having enough energy to\nescape, are supposed to pick up q-qbar pairs from the thermal matter rather\nthan creating them via the Schwinger mechanism. This represents a communication\nbetween jets and the flowing bulk matter (fluid-jet interaction). Also very\nimportant is the interaction between jet hadrons and the soft hadrons from the\nfluid freeze-out. We employ the new picture to investigate Pb-Pb collisions at\n2.76 TeV. We discuss the centrality and $p_{t}$ dependence of particle\nproduction and long range dihadron correlations at small and large $p_{t}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 15:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2012 09:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The main focus of this review is to illustrate how the\nlong standing anomalies between the calculated and measured current amplitudes\ncarried by a small conducting ring upon the application of a magnetic flux\n$\\phi$ can be removed. We discuss two different cases. First, we examine the\ncombined effect of second-neighbor hopping integral and Hubbard correlation on\nthe enhancement of persistent current in presence of disorder. A significant\nchange in current amplitude is observed compared to the traditional\nnearest-neighbor hopping model and the current amplitude becomes quite\ncomparable to experimental realizations. In the other case we verify that in\npresence of spin-orbit interaction a considerable enhancement of persistent\ncurrent amplitude takes place, and the current amplitude in a disordered ring\nbecomes almost comparable to that of an ordered one. In addition to these, we\nalso present the detailed band structures and some other related issues to get\na complete picture of the phenomena at the microscopic level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 10:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}
