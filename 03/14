In particular, we focus on the influence of an\neccentric orbit of the outer perturber on the dynamics of a small highly\ninclined inner body. Our analytical study of the secular perturbations relies\non the classical octupole hamiltonian expansion (third-order theory in the\nratio of the semi-major axes), as third-order terms are needed to consider the\nsecular variations of the outer perturber and potential secular resonances\nbetween the arguments of the pericenter and/or longitudes of the node of both\nbodies. Short-period averaging and node reduction (Laplace plane) reduce the\nproblem to two degrees of freedom. The four-dimensional dynamics is analyzed\nthrough representative planes which identify the main equilibria of the\nproblem. As in the circular problem (i.e. perturber on a circular orbit), the\n\"Kozai-bifurcated\" equilibria play a major role in the dynamics of an inner\nbody on quasi-circular orbit: its eccentricity variations are very limited for\nmutual inclination between the orbital planes smaller than ~40^{\\deg}, while\nthey become large and chaotic for higher mutual inclination. Particular\nattention is also given to a region around 35^{\\deg} of mutual inclination,\ndetected numerically by Funk et al.

Using a 12th-order\nHamiltonian expansion in eccentricities and inclinations, in particular its\naction-angle formulation obtained by Lie transforms in Libert & Henrard (2008),\nwe show that this region presents an equality of two fundamental frequencies\nand can be regarded as a secular resonance.

The majority of the methods to derive constraints on\ncosmological parameters use second-order statistics of the cosmic shear.\nDespite their success, second-order statistics are not optimal and degeneracies\nbetween some parameters remain. Tighter constraints can be obtained if\nsecond-order statistics are combined with a statistic that is efficient to\ncapture non-Gaussianity. In this paper, we search for such a statistical tool\nand we show that there is additional information to be extracted from\nstatistical analysis of the convergence maps beyond what can be obtained from\nstatistical analysis of the shear field. For this purpose, we have carried out\na large number of cosmological simulations along the {\\sigma}8-{\\Omega}m\ndegeneracy, and we have considered three different statistics commonly used for\nnon-Gaussian features characterization: skewness, kurtosis and peak count. To\nbe able to investigate non-Gaussianity directly in the shear field we have used\nthe aperture mass definition of these three statistics for different scales.\nThen, the results have been compared with the results obtained with the same\nstatistics estimated in the convergence maps at the same scales. First, we show\nthat shear statistics give similar constraints to those given by convergence\nstatistics, if the same scale is considered. In addition, we find that the peak\ncount statistic is the best to capture non-Gaussianities in the weak lensing\nfield and to break the {\\sigma}8-{\\Omega}m degeneracy. We show that this\nstatistical analysis should be conducted in the convergence maps: first,\nbecause there exist fast algorithms to compute the convergence map for\ndifferent scales, and secondly because it offers the opportunity to denoise the\nreconstructed convergence map, which improves non-Gaussian features extraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 17:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This\ncontamination arises from the diverse population of volatile organics and\ninorganics in the atmosphere. Such surface contamination can affect the\nuncertainties in determination of thickness, roughness and density of thin film\nstructures by X-Ray Reflectometry (XRR). Here we study the effect of a 0.5 nm\ncarbon surface contamination layer on thickness determination for a 20 nm\ntitanium nitride thin film on silicon. Uncertainties calculated using\nMarkov-Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian statistical methods from simulated data of\nclean and contaminated TiN thin films are compared at varying degrees of data\nquality to study (1) whether synchrotron sources cope better with contamination\nthan laboratory sources and (2) whether cleaning off the surface of thin films\nprior to XRR measurement is necessary. We show that, surprisingly,\ncontributions to uncertainty from surface contamination can dominate\nuncertainty estimates, leading to minimal advantages in using synchrotron- over\nlaboratory-intensity data. Further, even prior knowledge of the exact nature of\nthe surface contamination does not significantly reduce the contamination's\ncontribution to the uncertainty in the TiN layer thickness. We conclude, then,\nthat effective and standardized cleaning protocols are necessary to achieve\nhigh levels of accuracy in XRR measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 18:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

As with other ecosystems, its species composition is\nresilient against small disturbances but strong perturbations such as\nantibiotics can affect the consortium dramatically. Antibiotic cessation does\nnot necessarily restore pre-treatment conditions and disturbed microbiota are\noften susceptible to pathogen invasion. Here we propose a mathematical model to\nexplain how antibiotic-mediated switches in the microbiota composition can\nresult from simple social interactions between antibiotic-tolerant and\nantibiotic-sensitive bacterial groups. We build a two-species (e.g. two\nfunctional-groups) model and identify regions of domination by\nantibiotic-sensitive or antibiotic-tolerant bacteria, as well as a region of\nmultistability where domination by either group is possible. Using a new\nframework that we derived from statistical physics, we calculate the duration\nof each microbiota composition state. This is shown to depend on the balance\nbetween random fluctuations in the bacterial densities and the strength of\nmicrobial interactions. The singular value decomposition of recent metagenomic\ndata confirms our assumption of grouping microbes as antibiotic-tolerant or\nantibiotic-sensitive in response to a single antibiotic. Our methodology can be\nextended to multiple bacterial groups and thus it provides an ecological\nformalism to help interpret the present surge in microbiome data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 18:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Moreover, Monte Carlo methods can handle complicated\ngeometries and are relatively easy to extend to multiple spatial dimensions,\nwhich makes them potentially interesting in modeling complex multi-dimensional\nastrophysical phenomena such as core-collapse supernovae. The aim of this paper\nis to explore Monte Carlo methods for modeling neutrino transport in\ncore-collapse supernovae. We generalize the Implicit Monte Carlo photon\ntransport scheme of Fleck & Cummings and gray discrete-diffusion scheme of\nDensmore et al. to energy-, time-, and velocity-dependent neutrino transport.\nUsing our 1D spherically-symmetric implementation, we show that, similar to the\nphoton transport case, the implicit scheme enables significantly larger\ntimesteps compared with explicit time discretization, without sacrificing\naccuracy, while the discrete-diffusion method leads to significant speed-ups at\nhigh optical depth.

Recently the discovery of PSR J1719-1438, a 5.8 ms pulsar with a\ncompanion in a 2.2 hr orbit, was reported. The combination of this orbital\nperiod and the very low mass function is unique. The discoverers, Bailes et\nal., proposed an ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) as the progenitor system.\nHowever, the standard UCXB scenario would not produce this system as the time\nrequired to reach this orbital period exceeds the current estimate of the age\nof the Universe. The detached state of the system aggravates the problem. Aims.\nWe want to understand the evolutionary history of PSR J1719-1438, and determine\nunder which circumstances it could have evolved from an UCXB. Methods. We model\nUCXB evolution varying the donor size and investigate the effect of a wind mass\nloss from the donor, and compare the results with the observed characteristics\nof PSR J1719-1438. Results. An UCXB can reach a 2.2 hr orbit within the age of\nthe Universe, provided that 1) the millisecond pulsar can significantly heat\nand expand the donor by pulsar irradiation, or 2) the system loses extra\norbital angular momentum, e.g. via a fast wind from the donor. Conclusions. The\nmost likely scenario for the formation of PSR J1719-1438 is UCXB evolution\ndriven by angular momentum loss via the usual gravitational wave emission,\nwhich is enhanced by angular momentum loss via a donor wind of ~3x10^-13\nMsun/yr. Depending on the size of the donor during the evolution, the companion\npresently probably has a mass of ~1-3 Jupiter masses, making it a very low mass\nwhite dwarf as proposed by Bailes et al. Its composition can be either helium\nor carbon-oxygen. A helium white dwarf companion makes the long (for an UCXB)\norbital period easier to explain, but the required inclination makes it a\npriori less likely than a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 11:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-02"}

However, there is great uncertainty in how efficiently\nradiation couples to matter in these high optical depth environments. In\nparticular, it is unclear what levels of turbulence the radiation can produce,\nand whether the infrared radiation trapped by the dust opacity can give rise to\nheavily mass-loaded winds. In this paper we report a series of two-dimensional\nflux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics calculations performed with the\ncode ORION in which we drive strong radiation fluxes through columns of dusty\nmatter confined by gravity. We consider both systems where the radiation flux\nis sub-Eddington throughout the gas column, and where it is super-Eddington at\nthe midplane but sub-Eddington in the atmosphere. In the latter, we find that\nthe radiation-matter interaction gives rise to radiation-driven Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability, which drives supersonic turbulence at a level sufficient to fully\nexplain the turbulence seen in Galactic protocluster gas clouds, and to make a\nnon-trivial contribution to the turbulence observed in starburst galaxy disks.\nHowever, the instability also produces a channel structure in which the\nradiation-matter interaction is reduced because the radiation field is not\nfully trapped. For astrophysical parameters relevant to forming star clusters\nand starburst galaxies, we find that this effect reduces the net momentum\ndeposition rate in the dusty gas by a factor of ~2-6 compared to simple\nanalytic estimates, and that in steady state the Eddington ratio reaches unity\nand there are no strong winds.

In our previous studies we used the\nVassiliadis & Wood mass-loss rate, which stays low until the pulsation period\nreaches 500 days after which point a superwind begins. Vassiliadis & Wood noted\nthat for stars over 2.5Msun the superwind should be delayed until P ~ 750 days\nat 5Msun. We calculate evolutionary sequences where we delay the onset of the\nsuperwind to pulsation periods of P ~ 700-800 days in models of M = 5, 6, and\n7Msun. Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations show that the 6 and 7Msun\nmodels produce the most Rb, with [Rb/Fe] ~ 1 dex, close to the average of most\nof the Galactic Rb-rich stars ([Rb/Fe] ~ 1.4 plus or minus 0.8 dex). Changing\nthe rate of the 22Ne + alpha reactions results in variations of [Rb/Fe] as\nlarge as 0.5 dex in models with a delayed superwind. The largest enrichment in\nheavy elements is found for models that adopt the NACRE rate of the\n22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction. Using this rate allows us to best match the composition\nof most of the Rb-rich stars. A synthetic evolution algorithm is then used to\nremove the remaining envelope resulting in final [Rb/Fe] of ~ 1.4 dex although\nwith C/O ratios > 1.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions.

We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons.

The spectra\nof knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as\nbefore.

A fraction of these are\nlikely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of\nstellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular\nevolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with\nhighly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly\naffected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at\nthe highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission\nbecomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and\ncoalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than\nsimilar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of\nSMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of\nbinaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties. Such compact binaries\nwould be detectable as gravitational wave (GW) sources by the next generation\nof GW detectors (e.g. advanced- LIGO). About 0.5% of such nuclear merging\nbinaries will enter the LIGO observational window while on orbit that are still\nvery eccentric (e>~0.5). The efficient gravitational wave analysis for such\nsystems would therefore require the use of eccentric templates. We also find\nthat binaries very close to the MBH could evolve through a complex dynamical\n(non-secular) evolution leading to emission of several GW pulses during only a\nfew yrs (though these are likely to be rare). Finally, we note that the\nformation of close stellar binaries, X-ray binaries and their merger products\ncould be induced by similar secular processes, combined with tidal friction\nrather than GW emission as in the case of compact object binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 20:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 22:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Studies of particle\npile-up in static gas discs have provided partial support for this hypothesis.\nHere, we study the radial and temporal evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio in\nturbulent discs, that evolve under the action of viscosity and\nphotoevaporation. We find that particle pile-ups do not generically occur\nwithin evolving discs, particularly if the introduction of large grains is\nrestricted to the inner, dense regions of a disc. Instead, radial drift results\nin depletion of solids from the outer disc, while the inner disc maintains a\ndust-to-gas ratio that is within a factor of ~2 of the initial value. We\nattribute this result to the short time-scales for turbulent diffusion and\nradial advection (with the mean gas flow) in the inner disc. We show that the\nqualitative evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio depends only weakly upon the\nparameters of the disc model (the disc mass, size, viscosity, and value of the\nSchmidt number), and discuss the implications for planetesimal formation via\ncollective instabilities.

Resonant interactions and close planetary encounters are\nthought to be the primary inclination-excitation mechanisms, resulting in a\nresonant and non-resonant system, respectively. Here we propose an alternative\nformation scenario, starting from a system composed of three giant planets in a\nnearly coplanar configuration. As was recently shown for the case of the Solar\nsystem, planetary migration in the gas disc (Type II migration) can force the\nplanets to become trapped in a multiply resonant state. We simulate this\nprocess, assuming different values for the planetary masses and mass ratios. We\nshow that such a triple resonance generally becomes unstable as the resonance\nexcites the eccentricities of all planets and planet-planet scattering sets in.\nOne of the three planets is typically ejected from the system, leaving behind a\ndynamically 'hot' (but stable) two-planet configuration. The resulting\ntwo-planet systems typically have large values of semimajor axial ratios (a1/a2\n< 0.3), while the mutual inclination can be as high as 70{\\deg}, with a median\nof \\sim30{\\deg}. A small fraction of our two-planet systems (\\sim5 per cent)\nends up in the stability zone of the Kozai resonance. In a few cases, the\ntriple resonance can remain stable for long times and a '3D' system can form by\nresonant excitation of the orbital inclinations; such a three-planet system\ncould be stable if enough eccentricity damping is exerted on the planets.\nFinally, in the single-planet resulting systems, which are formed when two\nplanets are ejected from the system, the inclination of the planet's orbital\nplane with respect to the initial invariant plane -presumably the plane\nperpendicular to the star's spin axis- can be as large as \\sim40{\\deg}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 21:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Most studies\nhave so far concentrated on the colder parts (T<30K) of these regions. The aim\nis to characterize the warmer parts of the protostellar envelope in order to\nquantify the feedback of the protostars on their surroundings in terms of\nshocks, UV heating, photodissociation and outflow dispersal. Fully sampled\nlarge scale maps of the region were obtained; APEX-CHAMP+ was used for 12CO\n6-5, 13CO 6-5 and [CI] 2-1, and JCMT-HARP-B for 12CO 3-2 emissions.\nComplementary Herschel-HIFI and ground-based lines of CO and its isotopologs,\nfrom 1-0 upto 10-9 (Eu/k 300K), are collected at the source positions.\nRadiative-transfer models of the dust and lines are used to determine\ntemperatures and masses of the outflowing and UV-heated gas and infer the CO\nabundance structure. Broad CO emission line profiles trace entrained shocked\ngas along the outflow walls, with typical temperatures of ~100K. At other\npositions surrounding the outflow and the protostar, the 6-5 line profiles are\nnarrow indicating UV excitation. The narrow 13CO 6-5 data directly reveal the\nUV heated gas distribution for the first time. The amount of UV-heated and\noutflowing gas are found to be comparable from the 12CO and 13CO 6-5 maps,\nimplying that UV photons can affect the gas as much as the outflows. Weak [CI]\nemission throughout the region indicates a lack of CO dissociating photons.\nModeling of the C18O lines indicates the necessity of a \"drop\" abundance\nprofile throughout the envelope where the CO freezes out and is reloaded back\ninto the gas phase, thus providing quantitative evidence for the CO ice\nevaporation zone around the protostars. The inner abundances are less than the\ncanonical value of CO/H_2=2.7x10^-4, indicating some processing of CO into\nother species on the grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 22:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Additional sensitivity\ntests are performed on: (i) different parameterizations of the floe size\ndistribution (FSD), including the initial FSD used; (ii) the properties of the\nwave field; and (iii) the sea ice properties such as concentration, thickness\nand breaking strain. Results are relatively insensitive to FSD parameterization\nbut vary noticeably and systematically with its initial configuration, as they\ndo with properties (ii-iii). An additional, somewhat surprising sensitivity, is\nthe degree of influence of the numerical scheme that performs wave attenuation\nand advection. This is because a naive implementation of spatial and temporal\ndiscretizations can cause the waves to be over-attenuated, leading to a\nreduction of the predicted MIZ width by a substantial factor. Example\nsimulations intended to represent conditions in the Fram Strait in 2007, which\nexploit reanalyzed wave and ice model data, are shown to conclude the results\nsection. These compare favorably to estimates of MIZ width using concentrations\nobtained from remotely-sensed passive microwave images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 00:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-15"}

The standard proximal gradient method, also known as iterative\nsoft-thresholding when applied to this problem, has low computational cost per\niteration but a rather slow convergence rate. Nevertheless, when the solution\nis sparse, it often exhibits fast linear convergence in the final stage. We\nexploit the local linear convergence using a homotopy continuation strategy,\ni.e., we solve the $\\ell_1$-LS problem for a sequence of decreasing values of\nthe regularization parameter, and use an approximate solution at the end of\neach stage to warm start the next stage. Although similar strategies have been\nstudied in the literature, there have been no theoretical analysis of their\nglobal iteration complexity. This paper shows that under suitable assumptions\nfor sparse recovery, the proposed homotopy strategy ensures that all iterates\nalong the homotopy solution path are sparse. Therefore the objective function\nis effectively strongly convex along the solution path, and geometric\nconvergence at each stage can be established. As a result, the overall\niteration complexity of our method is $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ for finding an\n$\\epsilon$-optimal solution, which can be interpreted as global geometric rate\nof convergence.

It combines the molecular\ndipole moment of the solute with the polarization of a large subensemble of\nsolvent molecules at the solute-solvent interface. The goal of the theory is\ntwo-fold: (i) to formulate the problem of the dielectric response avoiding the\nreliance on the cavity-field concepts of dielectric theories and (ii) to\nseparate the non-additive polarization of the interface, jointly produced by\nthe external field of the laboratory experiment and the solute, from specific\nsolute-solvent interactions contributing to the dielectric signal. The theory\nis applied to experimentally reported frequency-dependent dielectric spectra of\nlysozyme in solution. The analysis of the data in the broad range of\nfrequencies up to 700 GHz shows that the cavity field susceptibility, critical\nfor the theory formulation, is consistent with the prediction of Maxwell's\nelectrostatics in the frequency range of 10--200 GHz, but deviates from it\noutside this range. In particular, it becomes much smaller then the Maxwell\nresult and shifts to negative values at small frequencies. The latter\nobservation implies a dia-electric response, or negative dielectrophoresis, of\nhydrated lysozyme. It also implies that the effective protein dipole recorded\nby dielectric spectroscopy is much smaller than the value calculated from\nprotein's charge distribution. We suggest an empirical equation that describes\nboth the increment of the static dielectric constat and the decrement of the\nDebye water peak with increasing protein concentration. It gives fair agreement\nwith broad-band dispersion and loss spectra of protein solutions, but misses\nthe delta-dispersion region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 06:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Star formation rates of 500-1100 Msun/yr are\nestimated from the 7.7 micron PAH feature. At such prodigious formation rates,\nthe galaxy stellar masses will double in 0.6-1.1 Gyr. We are viewing the peak\nepoch of star formation for these protocluster galaxies. However, it appears\nthat extinction of Halpha is much greater (factor of 40) in the two ULIRG HAEs\ncompared to the Spiderweb. This may be attributed to different spatial\ndistributions of star formation--nuclear star formation in the HAEs versus\nextended star formation in accreting satellite galaxies in the Spiderweb. We\nfind extremely luminous mid-IR rotational line emission from warm molecular\nhydrogen in the Spiderweb Galaxy, with L(H2 0-0 S(3))= 1.4E44 erg/s (3.7E10\nLsun), 20 times more luminous than any previously known H2 emission galaxy\n(MOHEG). Depending on temperature, this corresponds to a very large mass of\n>9E6-2E9 Msun of T>300 K molecular gas, heated by the PKS 1138-26 radio jet,\nacting to quench nuclear star formation. There is >8 times more warm H2 at\nthese temperatures in the Spiderweb than what has been seen in low-redshift\n(z<0.2) radio galaxies, indicating that the Spiderweb may have a larger\nreservoir of molecular gas than more evolved radio galaxies. This is the\nhighest redshift galaxy yet in which warm molecular hydrogen has been directly\ndetected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 08:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We consider\nseveral N-body simulations of such a system, with the initial velocity\ndispersion as a free parameter. We show that there is a clear difference\nbetween structures formed when the initial virial ratio is b_0 =2K_0/W_0 <\nb_0^c ~ -1/2 and b_0> b_0^c. These two sets of initial conditions give rise\nrespectively to a mild and violent relaxation occurring in about the same time\nscale: however in the latter case the system contracts by a large factor, while\nin the former it approximately maintains its original size. Correspondingly the\nresulting quasi equilibrium state is characterized by a density profile\ndecaying at large enough distances as ~1/r^4 or with a sharp cut-off. The case\nb_0<b_0^c can be well described by the Lynden-Bell theory of collisionless\nrelaxation considering the system confined in a box. On the other hand the\nrelevant feature for b_0>b_0^c is the ejection of particles and energy, which\nis not captured by such a theoretical approach: for this case we introduce a\nsimple physical model to explain the formation of the power-law density\nprofile. This model shows that the behavior n(r) ~1/r^4 is the typical density\nprofile that is obtained when the initial conditions are cold enough that mass\nand energy ejection occurs.

This posits a free energy functional for the\nsuperconductor in terms of a complex order parameter characterizing it. We\npropose, for superconducting cuprates, a similar functional of the complex, in\nplane, nearest neighbor spin singlet bond (or Cooper) pair amplitude psi_ij. A\ncrucial part of it is a (short range) positive interaction between nearest\nneighbor bond pairs, of strength J'. Such an interaction leads to nonzero long\nwavelength phase stiffness or superconductive long range order, with the\nobserved d-wave symmetry, below a temperature T_c\\simzJ' where z is the number\nof nearest neighbours; it is thus an emergent, collective consequence. Using\nthe functional, we calculate a large range of properties, e.g. the pseudogap\ntransition temperature T* as a function of hole doping x, the transition curve\nT_c(x), the superfluid stiffness rho_s(x,T), the specific heat (without and\nwith a magnetic field) due to the fluctuating pair degrees of freedom, and the\nzero temperature vortex structure.

In this\nwork, we use a combination of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES),\npump-probe measurements and quantum chemistry to investigate the ultrafast CT\ndynamics in a lutetium bisphthalocyanine dimer in different oxidation states.\nIt is found that in the anionic form, the combination of strong CT-exciton\ninteraction and electronic asymmetry induced by a counter-ion enables CT\nbetween the two macrocycles of the complex on a 30 fs timescale. Following\noptical excitation, a chain of electron and hole transfer steps gives rise to\ncharacteristic cross-peak dynamics in the electronic 2D spectra, and we monitor\nhow the excited state charge density ultimately localizes on the macrocycle\nclosest to the counter-ion within 100 fs. A comparison with the dynamics in the\nradical species further elucidates how CT states modulate the electronic\nstructure and tune fs-reaction dynamics. Our experiments demonstrate the unique\ncapability of 2D-ES in combination with other methods to decipher ultrafast CT\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 13:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

Significant v_2-v_6\nvalues are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),\npseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n\nvalues for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and\ntheir pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,\nv_n^{1/n}(pT) \\propto v_2^{1/2}(pT).

This problem has received\nmuch attention, but very little of this has focussed on the important practical\ncase where the data consists of noisy or incomplete observations of the\nunderlying hidden structure. This paper specifically addresses this problem,\ncomparing two alternative methodologies. In the first of these approaches\nparticle Markov chain Monte Carlo (Andrieu et al., 2010) is used to efficiently\nexplore the parameter space, combined with the exchange algorithm (Murray et\nal., 2006) for avoiding the calculation of the intractable normalising constant\n(a proof showing that this combination targets the correct distribution in\nfound in a supplementary appendix online). This approach is compared with\napproximate Bayesian computation (Pritchard et al., 1999). Applications to\nestimating the parameters of Ising models and exponential random graphs from\nnoisy data are presented. Each algorithm used in the paper targets an\napproximation to the true posterior due to the use of MCMC to simulate from the\nlatent graphical model, in lieu of being able to do this exactly in general.\nThe supplementary appendix also describes the nature of the resulting\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 07:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-19"}
