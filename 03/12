Their probable roles in heating\nand accelerating the solar wind via Landau and cyclotron resonances are\nquantified. We assume that (1) low-frequency Alfven and fast waves have the\nsame spectral shape and the same amplitude of power spectral density; (2) these\nwaves eventually reach ion cyclotron frequencies due to a turbulence cascade;\n(3) kinetic wave-particle interaction powers the solar wind. The existence of\nalpha particles in a dominant proton/electron plasma can trigger linear mode\nconversion between oblique fast-whistler and hybrid alpha-proton cyclotron\nwaves. The fast-cyclotron waves undergo both alpha and proton cyclotron\nresonances. The alpha cyclotron resonance in fast-cyclotron waves is much\nstronger than that in Alfven-cyclotron waves. For alpha cyclotron resonance, an\noblique fast-cyclotron wave has a larger left-handed electric field\nfluctuation, a smaller wave number, a larger local wave amplitude, and a\ngreater energization capability than a corresponding Alfven-cyclotron wave at\nthe same wave propagation angle \\theta, particularly at $80^\\circ$ < \\theta <\n$90^\\circ$. When Alfven-cyclotron or fast-cyclotron waves are present, alpha\nparticles are the chief energy recipient. The transition of preferential\nenergization from alpha particles to protons may be self-modulated by\ndifferential speed and temperature anisotropy of alpha particles via the\nself-consistently evolving wave-particle interaction. Therefore, fast-cyclotron\nwaves as a result of linear mode coupling is a potentially important mechanism\nfor preferential energization of minor ions in the main acceleration region of\nthe solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 17:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

Both objects are assumed to be\ndeformed due to their own rotations, as well as due to the mutual tidal\ninteractions. The general relativity corrections are considered in terms of the\npost-Newtonian approximation.

The algorithm uses zero\nmean normalized cross correlation to detect and locate an object in the image.\nA kalman filter is used to make the tracking algorithm computationally\nefficient. Object position in an image frame is predicted using the motion\nmodel and a search window, centered at the predicted position is generated.\nObject position is updated with the measurement from object detection. The\ndetected position is sent to the motion controller to move the gimbal so that\nthe object stays at the center of the image frame. Detection and tracking is\nautonomously carried out on the payload computer and the system is able to work\nin two different methods. The first method starts detecting and tracking using\na stored image patch. The second method allows the operator on the ground to\nselect the interest object for the UAV to track. The system is capable of\nre-detecting an object, in the event of tracking failure. Performance of the\ntracking system was verified both in the lab and on the field by mounting the\npayload on a vehicle and simulating a flight.

As a result, the range of applications of the DPF is broader than\nthe one for the RBPF. In this paper, we improve the DPF in two ways. First, we\nderive a Monte Carlo approximation of the optimal proposal distribution and,\nconsequently, design and implement a more efficient look-ahead DPF.

Our\nresults show that siRNA strongly binds to SWCNT surface via unzipping its\nbase-pairs and the propensity of unzipping increases with the increase in the\ndiameter of the SWCNTs. The unzipping and subsequent wrapping events are\ninitiated and driven by van der Waals interactions between the aromatic rings\nof siRNA nucleobases and the SWCNT surface. However, MD simulations of double\nstrand DNA (dsDNA) of the same sequence show that the dsDNA undergoes much less\nunzipping and wrapping on the SWCNT in the simulation time scale of 70 ns.

We have performed test\nmeasurements showing that the filter energy of the pre-spectrometer can be\nreduced by several keV in order to diminish this trap. These measurements were\nanalyzed with the help of a complex computer simulation, modeling multiple\nelectron reflections both from the detector and the photoelectric electron\nsource used in our test setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 10:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We compare these results with those\nfrom CGRO, and find a good agreement. Confirming previous studies, we find the\npresence of a high-energy MeV tail beyond a thermal-Comptonization spectrum;\nhowever, the tail is much softer and weaker than that recently published by\nLaurent et al. In spite of this difference, the observed high-energy tail could\nstill be due to the synchrotron emission of the jet of Cyg X-1, as claimed by\nLaurent et al.\n  To test this possibility, we study optically-thin synchrotron and\nself-Compton emission from partially self-absorbed jets. We develop formalisms\nfor calculating both emission of the jet base (which we define here as the\nregion where the jet starts its emission) and emission of the entire jet. We\nrequire the emission to match that observed at the turnover energy. The\noptically thin emission is dominated by that from the jet base, and it has to\nbecome self-absorbed within it at the turnover frequency. We find this implies\nthe magnetic field strength at the jet base of B_0 prop. to z_0^4, where z_0 is\nthe distance of the base from the black-hole centre. The value of B_0 is then\nconstrained from below by the condition that the self-Compton emission is below\nan upper limit in the GeV range, and from above by the condition that the\nPoynting flux does not exceed the jet kinetic power. This yields B_0 of the\norder of ~10^4 G and the location of the jet base at ~10^3 gravitational radii.\nUsing our formalism, we find the MeV tail can be due to jet synchrotron\nemission, but this requires the electron acceleration at a rather hard\npower-law index, p~1.3-1.6. For acceleration indices of p> 2, the amplitude of\nthe synchrotron component is much below that of MeV tail, and its origin is\nlikely to be due to hybrid Comptonization in the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 12:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This theory accounts for the realistic variation of the displacements\nthrough the thickness. The governing equations obtained here are solved for\nstatic analysis considering two types of sandwich FGM plates, viz., homogeneous\nface sheets with FGM core and FGM face sheets with homogeneous hard core. The\nin-plane and rotary inertia terms are considered for vibration studies. The\naccuracy of the present formulation is tested considering the problems for\nwhich three-dimensional elasticity solutions are available. A detailed\nnumerical study is carried out based on various higher-order models to examine\nthe influence of the gradient index and the plate aspect ratio on the\nglobal/local response of different sandwich FGM plates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 15:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-11"}

We consider the case of compact spatial\nsections (thus avoiding infrared divergences), with the topology of a\nthree-sphere. After expanding the perturbations in series of eigenfunctions of\nthe Laplace-Beltrami operator, the Hamiltonian of the system is written up to\nquadratic order in them. We fix the gauge of the local degrees of freedom in\ntwo different ways, reaching in both cases the same qualitative results. A\ncanonical transformation, which includes the scaling of the matter field\nperturbations by the scale factor of the geometry, is performed in order to\narrive at a convenient formulation of the system. We then study the\nquantization of these perturbations in the classical background determined by\nthe homogeneous variables. Based on previous work, we introduce a Fock\nrepresentation for the perturbations in which: (a) the complex structure is\ninvariant under the isometries of the spatial sections and (b) the field\ndynamics is implemented as a unitary operator. These two properties select not\nonly a unique unitary equivalence class of representations, but also a\npreferred field description, picking up a canonical pair of field variables\namong all those that can be obtained by means of a time-dependent scaling of\nthe matter field (completed into a linear canonical transformation). Finally,\nwe present an equivalent quantization constructed in terms of gauge-invariant\nquantities. We prove that this quantization can be attained by a mode-by-mode\ntime-dependent linear canonical transformation which admits a unitary\nimplementation, so that it is also uniquely determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 15:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 14:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

Methanol maser emission is found towards both W51 Main and South. We did\nnot detect any emission in the excited OH maser lines at 6.030 and 6.049 GHz\ndown to a 3 sigma limit of ~20 mJy per beam. Excited OH maser emission at 6.035\nGHz is only found towards W51 Main. This emission is highly circularly\npolarised (typically 45% and up to 87%). Seven Zeeman pairs were identified in\nthis transition, one of which contains detectable linear polarisation. The\nmagnetic field strength derived from these Zeeman pairs ranges from +1.6 to\n+6.8 mG, consistent with the previously published magnetic field strengths\ninferred from the OH ground-state lines. The bulk of the methanol maser\nemission is associated with W51 Main, sampling a total area of ~3\"x2.2\" (i.e.,\n~16200x11900 AU), while only two maser components, separated by ~2.5\", are\nfound in the W51 South region. The astrometric distributions of both 6.668-GHz\nmethanol and 6.035-GHz excited-OH maser emission in the W51 Main/South region\nare presented here. The methanol masers in W51 Main show a clear coherent\nvelocity and spatial structure with the bulk of the maser components\ndistributed into 2 regions showing a similar conical opening angle with of a\ncentral velocity of ~+55.5 km/s and an expansion velocity of =<5 km/s. The mass\ncontained in this structure is estimated to be at least 22 solar masses. The\nlocation of maser emission in the two afore-mentioned lines is compared with\nthat of previously published OH ground-state emission. Association with the\nUCHII regions in the W51 Main/South complex and relationship of the masers to\ninfall or outflow in the region are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 15:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This model takes into account couplings to the collective states\nof the interacting nuclei in the penetration of the Coulomb barrier and the\nsubsequent dynamical evolution of a nuclear shape from the contact\nconfiguration. In the fluctuation-dissipation model with a Langevin equation,\nthe effect of nuclear orientation at the initial impact on the prolately\ndeformed target nucleus is considered. Fusion-fission, quasi-fission and deep\nquasi-fission are separated as different Langevin trajectories on the potential\nenergy surface.
