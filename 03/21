Strong\nfeatures at H-alpha are observed in the transmission spectra of both HD 189733b\nand HD 209458b. We attempt to characterize and remove the effects of stellar\nvariability in HD 189733b, and along with an empirical Monte Carlo test the\nresults imply a statistically significant transit-dependent feature of\n(-8.72+/-1.48)x10^-4 integrated over a 16 Angstrom band relative to the\nadjacent continuum. We interpret this as the first detection of this line in an\nexoplanetary atmosphere. A previous detection of Ly-alpha in HD 189733b's\natmosphere allows us to calculate an excitation temperature for hydrogen,\nT_exc=2.6x10^4 K. This calculation depends significantly on certain simplifying\nassumptions. We explore these assumptions and argue that T_exc is very likely\nmuch greater than the radiative equilibrium temperature (the temperature the\nplanet is assumed to be at based on stellar radiation and the planetary\ndistance) of HD 189733b. A large T_exc implies a very low density that is not\nin thermodynamic equilibrium the planet's lower atmosphere. We argue that the\nn=2 hydrogen required to cause H-alpha absorption in the atmosphere is created\nas a result of the greater UV flux at HD 189733b, which has the smallest orbit\nand most chromospherically active central star in our sample. Though the\noverall integration of HD 209458b's transmission spectrum over a wide band is\nconsistent with zero, it contains a dramatic, statistically significant feature\nin the transmission spectrum with reflectional symmetry. We discuss possible\nphysical processes that could cause this feature. Our remaining two targets (HD\n147506b and HD 149026b) do not show any clear features, so we place upper\nlimits on their H-alpha absorption levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 16:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

As the Zeeman field\ncrosses the critical bulk value B_c of the topological transition, a Majorana\nbound state (MBS) is formed, giving rise to a sharp zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) in\nthe tunneling differential conductance. We identify novel features beyond this\npicture in wires with inhomogeneous depletion, like the appearance of two MBSs\ninside a long depleted region for B<B_c. The resulting ZBA is in most cases\nweakly split and may coexist with Andreev bound states near zero energy. The\nZBA may appear without evidence of a topological gap closing.

Particle-in-cell\nsimulations are carried out to explore the mechanisms of energetic electron\ntransport from the corona to the chromosphere and possible confinement. We set\nup an initial system of pre-accelerated hot electrons in contact with ambient\ncold electrons along the local magnetic field, and let it evolve over time.\nSuppression of transport by a nonlinear, highly localized electrostatic\nelectric field (in the form of a double layer) is observed after a short phase\nof free-streaming by hot electrons. The double layer (DL) emerges at the\ncontact of the two electron populations. It is driven by an ion-electron\nstreaming instability due to the drift of the back-streaming return current\nelectrons interacting with the ions. The DL grows over time and supports a\nsignificant drop in temperature and hence reduces heat flux between the two\nregions that is sustained for the duration of the simulation. This study shows\ntransport suppression begins when the energetic electrons start to propagate\naway from a coronal acceleration site. It also implies confinement of energetic\nelectrons with kinetic energies less than the electrostatic energy of the DL\nfor the DL lifetime, which is much longer than the electron transit time\nthrough the source region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 16:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-08"}

Well-known GP mechanisms, such as type classes and the C++0x\nconcepts proposal, usually combine two features: 1) a special type of\ninterfaces; and 2) implicit instantiation of implementations of those\ninterfaces.\n  Scala implicits are a GP language mechanism, inspired by type classes, that\nbreak with the tradition of coupling implicit instantiation with a special type\nof interface. Instead, implicits provide only implicit instantiation, which is\ngeneralized to work for any types. This turns out to be quite powerful and\nuseful to address many limitations that show up in other GP mechanisms.\n  This paper synthesizes the key ideas of implicits formally in a minimal and\ngeneral core calculus called the implicit calculus, and it shows how to build\nsource languages supporting implicit instantiation on top of it. A novelty of\nthe calculus is its support for partial resolution and higher-order rules (a\nfeature that has been proposed before, but was never formalized or\nimplemented). Ultimately, the implicit calculus provides a formal model of\nimplicits, which can be used by language designers to study and inform\nimplementations of similar mechanisms in their own languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 16:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-21"}

In this letter (the first of a series dedicated to\nmodel magnetar outbursts), we tackle the long-standing open issue of whether or\nnot short bursts and glitches are always connected to long-term radiative\noutbursts. We show that the recent detection of short bursts and glitches\nseemingly unconnected to outbursts is only misleading our understanding of\nthese events. We show that, in the framework of the starquake model, neutrino\nemission processes in the magnetar crust limit the temperature, and therefore\nthe luminosity. This natural limit to the maximum luminosity makes outbursts\nassociated with bright persistent magnetars barely detectable. These events are\nsimply seen as a small luminosity increase over the already bright quiescent\nstate, followed by a fast return to quiescence. In particular, this is the case\nfor 1RXS J1708-4009, 1E 1841-045, SGR 1806-20, and other bright persistent\nmagnetars. On the other hand, a similar event (with the same energetics) in a\nfainter source will drive a more extreme luminosity variation and longer\ncooling time, as for sources such as XTE J1810-197, 1E 1547-5408 and SGR\n1627-41.

Observations from 1.4 to 43 GHz have been obtained with the VLA and\nEffelsberg telescopes, and data from 74 to 408 MHz have been compiled from the\nliterature.\n  The fractions of candidate GHz-peaked sources are similar in the two samples\n(36\\pm12% vs 23\\pm8%), suggesting that BAL QSOs are not generally younger than\nnon-BAL QSOs. BAL and non-BAL QSOs show a large range of spectral indices,\nconsistent with a broad range of orientations. There is weak evidence (91%\nconfidence) that the spectral indices of the BAL QSOs are steeper than those of\nnon-BAL QSOs, mildly favouring edge-on orientations. At a higher level of\nsignificance (\\geq97%), the spectra of BAL QSOs are not flatter than those of\nnon-BAL QSOs, which suggests that a polar orientation is not preferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 17:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Stokes Inversion\nbased on Response functions (SIR) is an implementation widely used by the solar\nphysics community. It allows to work with different atmospheric components,\nwhere gradients of different physical parameters are possible, e.g., magnetic\nfield strength and velocities. The spectropolarimetric full-disk observations\nwere carried out with the Stokesmeter of the Solar Telescope for Operative\nPredictions (STOP) at the Sayan Observatory on 3 February 2009, when neither an\nactive region nor any other extended flux concentration was present on the Sun.\nIn this study of quiet Sun magnetic fields, we apply the SIR code\nsimultaneously to 15 spectral lines. A tendency is found that weaker magnetic\nfield strengths occur closer to the limb. We explain this finding by the fact\nthat close to the limb, we are more sensitive to higher altitudes in an\nexpanding flux tube, where the field strength should be smaller since the\nmagnetic flux is conserved with height. Typically, the inversions deliver two\npopulations of magnetic elements: (1) high magnetic field strengths (1500-2000\nG) and high temperatures (5500-6500 K) and (2) weak magnetic fields (50-150 G)\nand low temperatures (5000-5300 K).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 17:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

These events were\ndiscovered as a byproduct of an analysis designed to find short timescale\nsingle lens events that may be due to free-floating planets. Three of these\nevents are determined to be microlensing events, while the fourth is most\nlikely caused by stellar variability. For each of the three microlensing\nevents, the signal is almost entirely due to a brief caustic feature with\nlittle or no lensing attributable mainly to the lens primary. One of these\nevents, MOA-bin-1, is due to a planet, and it is the first example of a\nplanetary event in which stellar host is only detected through binary\nmicrolensing effects. The mass ratio and separation are q = 4.9 +- 1.4 x\n10^{-3} and s = 2.10 +- 0.05, respectively. A Bayesian analysis based on a\nstandard Galactic model indicates that the planet, MOA-bin-1Lb, has a mass of\nm_p = 3.7 +- 2.1 M_{Jup}, and orbits a star of M_* = 0.75{+0.33 -0.41} M_solar\nat a semi-major axis of a = 8.3 {+4.5 -2.7} AU. This is one of the most massive\nand widest separation planets found by microlensing. The scarcity of such wide\nseparation planets also has implications for interpretation of the isolated\nplanetary mass objects found by this analysis. If we assume that we have been\nable to detect wide separation planets with a efficiency at least as high as\nthat for isolated planets, then we can set limits on the distribution on\nplanets in wide orbits.

Our combined clustering sample is the largest\nspectroscopic quasar clustering sample to date, containing ~48,000 quasars in\nthe redshift range 0.4<z<2.5 with median redshift 1.4. We interpret these\nprecise 2PCF measurements within the halo occupation distribution (HOD)\nframework and constrain the occupation functions of central and satellite\nquasars in dark matter halos. In order to explain the small-scale clustering,\nthe HOD modeling requires that a small fraction of z~1.4 quasars,\nfsat=(7.4+/-1.4) 10^(-4), be satellites in dark matter halos.

Such an assumption is valid for the downlink\nmulti-user MIMO systems with linear precoders that depend on channels to all\nreceivers. We propose a concept called dual systems with zero-forcing designs\nbased on the duality principle, originally proposed to relate Gaussian\nmulti-access channels (MACs) and Gaussian broadcast channels (BCs). For the\ntwo-user N*2 MIMO BC with N antennas at the transmitter and two antennas at\neach of the receivers, we design a downlink interference cancellation (IC)\ntransmission scheme using the dual of uplink MAC systems employing IC methods.\nThe transmitter simultaneously sends two precoded Alamouti codes, one for each\nuser. Each receiver can zero-force the unintended user's Alamouti codes and\ndecouple its own data streams using two simple linear operations independent of\nCSIR. Analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves a diversity gain of\n2(N-1) for equal energy constellations with short-term power and rate\nconstraints. Power allocation between two users can also be performed, and it\nimproves the array gain but not the diversity gain. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the bit error rate of the downlink IC scheme has a substantial\ngain compared to the block diagonalization method, which requires global\nchannel information at each node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 21:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-22"}

When the lengthscale for the disorder, $l_d$, is much greater\nthan the coherence length, $l_c$, earlier analytical calculations of quantum\nconduction on the Bethe lattice demonstrate that for $k=3$ the metal-insulator\ntransition (MIT) is discontinuous, suggesting a new universality class of\ndisorder-driven quantum MITs.

In this problem, a set of $n$ jobs have to be\ndistributed among a set of $m$ (unrelated) machines, given the processing time\nof each job on each machine, where each machine has a startup cost. The goal is\nto produce a schedule of minimum total startup cost subject to a constraint\n$\\bf L$ on its makespan. While Khuller {\\em et al} considered the offline\nversion of this problem, a typical scenario in scheduling is one where jobs\narrive online and have to be assigned to a machine immediately on arrival. We\ngive an $(O(\\log (mn)\\log m), O(\\log m))$-competitive randomized online\nalgorithm for this problem, i.e. the schedule produced by our algorithm has a\nmakespan of $O({\\bf L} \\log m)$ with high probability, and a total expected\nstartup cost of $O(\\log (mn)\\log m)$ times that of an optimal offline schedule\nwith makespan $\\bf L$. The competitive ratios of our algorithm are (almost)\noptimal.\n  Our algorithms use the online primal dual framework introduced by Alon {\\em\net al} for the online set cover problem, and subsequently developed further by\nBuchbinder, Naor, and co-authors. To the best of our knowledge, all previous\napplications of this framework have been to linear programs (LPs) with either\npacking or covering constraints. One novelty of our application is that we use\nthis framework for a mixed LP that has both covering and packing constraints.\nWe hope that the algorithmic techniques developed in this paper to\nsimultaneously handle packing and covering constraints will be useful for\nsolving other online optimization problems as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 23:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-22"}

In 2006, a set\nof VLBA observations performed throughout the entire orbit of the system were\nnot used to study its precession because the changes in radio morphology could\ntentatively be explained by the alternative pulsar model. However, a recent\nradio spectral index data analysis has confirmed the predictions of the\ntwo-peak microquasar model, which therefore does apply in LSI+61303. Aims: We\nrevisit the set of VLBA observations performed throughout the orbit to\ndetermine the precession period and improve our understanding of the physical\nmechanism behind the precession. Methods: By reanalyzing the VLBA data set, we\nimprove the dynamic range of images by a factor of four, using\nself-calibration. Different fitting techniques are used and compared to\ndetermine the peak positions in phase-referenced maps. Results: The improved\ndynamic range shows that in addition to the images with a one-sided structure,\nthere are several images with a double-sided structure. The astrometry\nindicates that the peak in consecutive images for the whole set of observations\ndescribes a well-defined ellipse, 6-7 times larger than the orbit, with a\nperiod of about 28 d. Conclusions: A double-sided structure is not expected to\nbe formed from the expanding shocked wind predicted in the pulsar scenario. In\ncontrast, a precessing microquasar model can explain the double- and one-sided\nstructures in terms of variable Doppler boosting. The ellipse defined by the\nastrometry could be the cross-section of the precession cone, at the distance\nof the 8.4 GHz-core of the steady jet, and 28d the precession period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 23:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 12:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

The model includes regular environmental cycles (e.g.\nhydration-dehydration cycles) that drive polymers between times of replication\nand functional activity, which coincide with times of different monomer and\npolymer diffusivity. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this\nproposed prebiotic scenario provides a robust mechanism for the exploration of\nsequence space. Introduction of a polymer sequence with monomer synthetase\nactivity illustrates that functional sequences can become established in a\npreexisting pool of otherwise non-functional sequences. Functional selection\ndoes not dominate system dynamics and sequence diversity remains high,\npermitting the emergence and spread of more than one functional sequence. It is\nalso observed that polymers spontaneously form clusters in simulations where\npolymers diffuse more slowly than monomers, a feature that is reminiscent of a\nprevious proposal that the earliest stages of life could have been defined by\nthe collective evolution of a system-wide cooperation of polymer aggregates.\nOverall, the results presented demonstrate the merits of considering plausible\nprebiotic polymer chemistries and environments that would have allowed for the\nrapid turnover of monomer resources and for regularly varying monomer/polymer\ndiffusivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 23:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-20"}

No motion occurs when the\nexternal field is weaker than the frictional resistance. However, with the\nintervention of an external noise, a viscous friction like property emerges;\nthus the sphere rolls with an uniform drift velocity that is proportional to\nthe applied field. As the sphere rolls, it rocks forward and backward resulting\nin substantial fluctuation of displacement opposite to the net drift. The ratio\nof the integrated probabilities of the negative to positive work fluctuations\ndecreases monotonically with the time of observation, from which a temperature\nlike intensive parameter can be estimated. This parameter conforms to the\nEinstein's ratio of diffusivity and mobility that increases almost linearly,\neven though the diffusivity increases super-linearly, with the strength of the\nnoise. A new barrier crossing experiment is introduced that can be performed\neither with a hard (e.g. a steel ball) or with a soft (e.g. a water drop)\nsphere in contact with a periodically undulated substrate. The frequency of\nbarrier crossing follows the classical transition state equation allowing a\ndirect estimation of the effective temperature.

The study of LBGs may help define the\nfeed-back relationship between black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies.\nPrevious VLA observations have shown that the kpc-scale radio emission from\nLBAs is dominated by starbursts. The main targets of this VLBI experiment were\nselected because they possessed emission-line properties between starbursts and\nType 2 (obscured) AGN. Eight targets (three star-forming LBAs, four composite\nLBAs, and one Type 1 AGN) were observed at 5 GHz, four of which were also\nobserved at 1.7 GHz. One star-forming LBA and one composite LBA were detected\nabove 5 \\sigma at 1.7 GHz (only), while the AGN was detected at 5 GHz. In both\nLBAs, the radio luminosity (LR) exceeds that expected from supernovae\n(remnants) based on a comparison with Arp220, Arp229A and Mrk273, by factors of\n2 - 8. The composite LBA exhibits a compact core emitting around 10% of the VLA\nflux density. The high Tb of 3.5E7 K and excess core L_R with respect to the\nL_R/L_X relation of radio-quiet AGN indicate that this LBA possesses an\nobscured AGN (MBH ~ E5-E7 M_sun). While weak AGN may co-exist with the\nstarbursts as shown in at least one of the LBAs, their contribution to the\ntotal radio flux is fairly minimal.

The associated electron and\npositron capture rates for these isotopes of iron are also calculated in\nstellar matter. These calculations were recently introduced and this paper is a\nfollow-up which discusses in detail the GT strength distributions and stellar\ncapture rates of key iron isotopes. The calculations are performed within the\nframework of the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation\n(pn-QRPA) theory. The pn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic\n\\textit{state-by-state} calculation of GT strength functions and stellar\ncapture rates which greatly increases the reliability of the results. For the\nfirst time experimental deformation of nuclei are taken into account. In the\ncore of massive stars isotopes of iron, $^{54,55,56}$Fe, are considered to be\nkey players in decreasing the electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{e}$) mainly via\nelectron capture on these nuclide. The structure of the presupernova star is\naltered both by the changes in $Y_{e}$ and the entropy of the core material.\nResults are encouraging and are compared against measurements (where possible)\nand other calculations. The calculated electron capture rates are in overall\ngood agreement with the shell model results. During the presupernova evolution\nof massive stars, from oxygen shell burning stages till around end of\nconvective core silicon burning, the calculated electron capture rates on\n$^{54}$Fe are around three times bigger than the corresponding shell model\nrates.

Magnetic impurities can remain unscreened at such sites. We\ndetermine the density of the resulting free magnetic moments in the zero\ntemperature limit. While it is finite on the insulating side of the AMIT, it\nvanishes at the AMIT, and decays with a power law as function of the distance\nto the AMIT. Since the fluctuating spins of these free magnetic moments break\nthe time reversal symmetry of the conduction electrons, we find a shift of the\nAMIT, and the appearance of a semimetal phase. The distribution function of the\nKondo temperature $T_{K}$ is derived at the AMIT, in the metallic phase and in\nthe insulator phase. This allows us to find the quantum phase diagram in an\nexternal magnetic field $B$ and at finite temperature $T$. We calculate the\nresulting magnetic susceptibility, the specific heat, and the spin relaxation\nrate as function of temperature. We find a phase diagram with finite\ntemperature transitions between insulator, critical semimetal, and metal\nphases.

Combined with a simple diffusive grain growth model, this\nmechanism is able to explain the observed seismic asymmetry, but not the bulk\nanisotropy. The source of anisotropy has therefore to be sought in the shear\nmotions caused by higher modes of convection.

In a second\npart we present complementary numerical data for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model\non the orthogonal-dimer chain. We analyze several examples of T=0 magnetization\ncurves, entropy as a function of temperature T and magnetic field, and the\nassociated magnetic cooling rate. Comparison of the two models shows that in\ncertain situations the simplified exactly solvable model yields a qualitatively\nor sometimes even quantitatively accurate description of the more challenging\nquantum model, including a case which may be relevant to experimental\nobservations of an enhanced magnetocaloric effect in the two-dimensional\ncompound SrCu2(BO3)2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 14:20:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 11:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-15"}
