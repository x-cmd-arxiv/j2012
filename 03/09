Despite a\nrelatively large field of view of OSIRIS (8'x8'), the change in the wavelength\nacross the field (~80 Ang) and the long-tail of Tunable Filter (TF) spectral\nresponse function, are hindrances for obtaining accurate flux calibrated\nemission-line maps of extended sources. The purpose of this article is to\ndemonstrate that emission-line maps useful for diagnostics of nebula can be\ngenerated over the entire field of view of OSIRIS, if we make use of\ntheoretically well-understood characteristics of TFs. We have successfully\ngenerated the flux-calibrated images of the nearby, large late-type spiral\ngalaxy M101 in the emission lines of Halpha, [NII]6583, [SII]6716 and\n[SII]6731. We find that the present uncertainty in setting the central\nwavelength of TFs (~1 Ang), is the biggest source of error in the emission-line\nfluxes. By comparing the Halpha fluxes of HII regions in our images with the\nfluxes derived from Halpha images obtained using narrow-band filters, we\nestimate an error of ~11% in our fluxes. The flux calibration of the images was\ncarried out by fitting the SDSS griz magnitudes of in-frame stars with the\nstellar spectra from the SDSS spectral database. This method resulted in an\naccuracy of 3% in flux calibration of any narrow-band image, which is as good\nas, if not better, to that is feasible using the observations of\nspectrophotometric standard stars. Thus time-consuming calibration images need\nnot be taken.

The\ncluster system is well confined to the optically visible outer contours of NGC\n1316. The color distribution of the entire sample is unimodal, but the color\ndistribution of bright subsamples in the bulge shows two peaks that, by\ncomparison with theoretical Washington colors with solar metallicity,\ncorrespond to ages of about 2 Gyr and 0.8 Gyr, respectively.

The color interval 1.3 < C-R < 1.6 hosts the bulk of\nintermediate-age clusters which show a surface density profile with a sharp\ndecline at about 4 arcmin. The outer cluster population shows an unimodal color\ndistribution with a peak at C-R=1.1, indicating a larger contribution of old,\nmetal-poor clusters. Their luminosity function does not show the expected\nturn-over, so the fraction of younger clusters is still significant.

The iterative\nalgorithm allows fault- free nodes to reach approximate conensus despite the\npresence of up to f Byzantine faults. Necessary conditions on the underlying\nnetwork graph for the existence of a correct IABC algorithm were shown in our\nrecent work [15, 16]. [15] also analyzed a specific IABC algorithm and showed\nthat it performs correctly in any network graph that satisfies the necessary\ncondition, proving that the necessary condition is also sufficient. In this\npaper, we present an alternate proof of correctness of the IABC algorithm,\nusing a familiar technique based on transition matrices [9, 3, 17, 19].\n  The key contribution of this paper is to exploit the following observation:\nfor a given evolution of the state vector corresponding to the state of the\nfault-free nodes, many alternate state transition matrices may be chosen to\nmodel that evolution cor- rectly. For a given state evolution, we identify one\napproach to suitably \"design\" the transition matrices so that the standard\ntools for proving convergence can be applied to the Byzantine fault-tolerant\nalgorithm as well. In particular, the transition matrix for each iteration is\ndesigned such that each row of the matrix contains a large enough number of\nelements that are bounded away from 0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 19:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

Although extensive studies\nhave been performed to compare ontological measures with human judgment, the\ndistributional measures have primarily been evaluated by indirect means. This\npaper is a detailed study of some of the major distributional measures; it\nlists their respective merits and limitations. New measures that overcome these\ndrawbacks, that are more in line with the human notions of semantic\nrelatedness, are suggested. The paper concludes with an exhaustive comparison\nof the distributional and ontology-based measures. Along the way, significant\nresearch problems are identified.

Due to confusion, only a\nsmall fraction of the Cosmic Infrared Background can be resolved into\nindividually-detected sources. Our goal is to produce deep galaxy number counts\nand redshift distributions below the confusion limit, which we then use to\nplace strong constraints on the origins of the cosmic infrared background and\non models of galaxy evolution.\n  We individually extracted the bright SPIRE with a method using the positions,\nthe flux densities, and the redshifts of the 24um sources as a prior, and\nderived the number counts and redshift distributions of the bright SPIRE\nsources. For fainter SPIRE sources, we reconstructed the number counts and the\nredshift distribution below the confusion limit using the deep 24um catalogs\nassociated with photometric redshift and information provided by the stacking\nof these sources into the deep SPIRE maps. Finally, by integrating all these\ncounts, we studied the contribution of the galaxies to the CIB as a function of\ntheir flux density and redshift.\n  Through stacking, we managed to reconstruct the source counts per redshift\nslice down to ~2 mJy in the three SPIRE bands, which lies about a factor 10\nbelow the 5sigma confusion limit. None of the pre-existing population models\nare able to reproduce our results at better than 3sigma. Finally, we\nextrapolate our counts to zero flux density in order to derive an estimate of\nthe total contribution of galaxies to the CIB, finding 10.1, 6.5, and 2.8\nnW/m2/sr at 250, 350, and 500um, respectively. These values agree well with\nFIRAS absolute measurements, suggesting our number counts and their\nextrapolation are sufficient to explain the CIB. Finally, combining our results\nwith other works, we estimate the energy budget contained in the CIB between 8\nand 1000um: 26 nW/m2/sr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 18:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We find that only the fastest rotating progenitors achieve sufficient\ncompactness for black-hole formation while the bulk of models possess a core\ndensity structure typical of garden-variety core-collapse supernova (SN)\nprogenitors evolved without rotation and at solar metallicity. Of the models\nthat do have sufficient compactness for black-hole formation, most of them also\nretain a large amount of angular momentum in the core, making them prone to a\nmagneto-rotational explosion, therefore preferentially leaving behind a\nproto-magnetar. A large progenitor angular-momentum budget is often the sole\ncriterion invoked in the community today to assess the suitability for\nproducing a collapsar. This simplification ignores equally important\nconsiderations such as the core compactness, which conditions black-hole\nformation, the core angular momentum, which may foster a magneto-rotational\nexplosion preventing black-hole formation, or the metallicity and the residual\nenvelope mass which must be compatible with inferences from observed LGRB/SNe.\nOur study suggests that black-hole formation is non trivial, that there is room\nfor accommodating both collapsars and proto-magnetars as LGRB progenitors,\nalthough proto-magnetars seem much more easily produced by current\nstellar-evolutionary models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 01:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-31"}

Aims. We aim to separate stars and\ngalaxies in the data from the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Deep survey\ncollected in nine AKARI / IRC bands from 2 to 24 {\\mu}m that cover the near-\nand mid-infrared wavelengths (hereafter NIR and MIR).

This statistic was optimized with data from the\npreliminary WISE survey and the SDSS, and tested with Lick 3-m Kast\nspectroscopy. We find that sources with S_IX < 0 have a <~95% likelihood of\nbeing an AGN (defined in this paper as a Seyfert 1, quasar or blazar). This\nstatistic was then applied to the full WISE/2MASS/RASS dataset, including the\nfinal WISE data release, to yield the \"W2R\" sample of 4,316 sources with S_IX <\n0. Only 2,209 of these sources are currently in the Veron-Cetty and Veron (VCV)\ncatalog of spectroscopically confirmed AGN, indicating that the W2R sample\ncontains nearly 2,000 new, relatively bright (J <~ 16) AGN.\n  We utilize the W2R sample to quantify biases and incompleteness in the VCV\ncatalog. We find it is highly complete for bright (J < 14), northern AGN, but\nthe completeness drops below 50% for fainter, southern samples and for sources\nnear the Galactic plane. This approach also led to the spectroscopic\nidentification of 10 new AGN in the Kepler field, more than doubling the number\nof AGN being monitored by Kepler. This has identified ~1 bright AGN every 10\nsquare degrees, permitting construction of AGN samples in any sufficiently\nlarge region of sky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 21:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 19:24:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 16:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-08"}

Axial\ndiffusion of the concentration peak limits the separation efficiency.\nElectromigration dispersion is observed when the concentration of sample ions\nis comparable to that of the background ions. Under such conditions, the local\nelectrical conductivity is significantly altered in the sample zone making the\nelectric field, and therefore, the ion migration velocity concentration\ndependent. The resulting nonlinear wave exhibits shock like features, and,\nunder certain simplifying assumptions, is described by Burgers' equation (S.\nGhosal and Z. Chen Bull. Math.

The main result is a one dimensional nonlinear\nadvection diffusion equation for the area averaged concentration. This\nhomogenized equation accounts for the Taylor-Aris dispersion resulting from the\nvariation in the electro-osmotic slip velocity along the wall. It is shown that\nin a certain range of parameters, the electro-osmotic flow can actually reduce\nthe total dispersion by delaying the formation of a concentration shock.\nHowever, if the electro-osmotic flow is sufficiently high, the total dispersion\nis increased because of the Taylor-Aris contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 22:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In many of optical systems, such as parametric\ndown conversion or interference of optical squeezed states, production of two\nperfectly symmetric subsystems is usually used for demonstrating the existence\nof entanglement. This symmetry simplifies the description of the concept of\nentanglement. However, asymmetry in entanglement may arise naturally in a real\nexperiment, or be intentionally introduced in a given quantum information\nprotocol. These asymmetries can emerge from having the output beams experience\ndifferent losses and environmental contamination, or from the availability of\nnon-identical input quantum states in quantum communication protocols. In this\npaper, we present a visualisation of entanglement using quadrature amplitude\nplots of the twin beams. We quantitatively discuss the strength of asymmetric\nentanglement using EPR and inseparability criteria and theoretically show that\nthe optimal beamsplitter ratio for entanglement is dependent on the asymmetries\nand may not be 50/50. To support this theory, we present experimental results\nshowing one particular asymmetric entanglement where a 0.78/0.22 beamsplitter\nis optimal for observing entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 03:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-12"}

However, if the matter source is a special\nscalar field rather than a perfect fluid, then $r_c\\rightarrow\\infty$ and the\ncausality violation is thus avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 08:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 12:07:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 11:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2012 13:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-15"}

The electron-lattice coupling associated\nwith the eg(Exe) and t2g(Txe) orbitals of Cu2+ in CuWO4 are obtained from\ncorrelations between the JT distortion of the CuO6 octahedron and the\nassociated structure of Cu2+ d-electronic levels. This distortion and its\nassociated JT energy (EJT) decrease upon compression in both phases. However,\nboth the distortion and associated EJT increase sharply at the phase transition\npressure (PT = 9.9 GPa) and we estimate that the JT distortion persists for a\nwide pressure range not being suppressed up to 37 GPa. These results shed light\non the transition mechanism of multiferroic CuWO4 suggesting that the\npressureinduced structural phase transition is a way to minimize the distortive\neffects associated with the toughness of the JT distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 13:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-20"}

Their detection and the understanding of their formation,\nmorphology and thermodynamical characteristics can provide important\ninformation on their hosting environment, especially concerning the magnetic\nfield, whose understanding constitutes a major problem in solar physics. An\nexample of such blobs is coronal rain, a phenomenon of thermal non- equilibrium\nobserved in active region loops, which consists of cool and dense chromospheric\nblobs falling along loop-like paths from coronal heights. So far, only off-limb\ncoronal rain has been observed and few reports on the phenomenon exist. In the\npresent work, several datasets of on-disk H{\\alpha} observations with the CRisp\nImaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP) at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) are\nanalyzed. A special family of on-disk blobs is selected for each dataset and a\nstatistical analysis is carried out on their dynamics, morphology and\ntemperatures. All characteristics present distributions which are very similar\nto reported coronal rain statistics. We discuss possible interpretations\nconsidering other similar blob-like structures reported so far and show that a\ncoronal rain interpretation is the most likely one. Their chromospheric nature\nand the projection effects (which eliminate all direct possibility of height\nestimation) on one side, and their small sizes, fast dynamics, and especially,\ntheir faint character (offering low contrast with the background intensity) on\nthe other side, are found as the main causes for the absence until now of the\ndetection of this on-disk coronal rain counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 13:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The problem is formulated in an $L^2$-setting with\nunderlying measure $\\mu=\\varrho m$. Here $\\varrho$ is a positive density,\nintegrable with respect to the measure $m$ and fulfilling the Hamza condition.\nThe measure $m$ is such that the boundary of $E$ is not of $m$-measure zero. A\nreference measure of this type is needed in order to give meaning to the\nso-called Wentzell boundary condition which is in literature typical for\nmodeling such kind of boundary behavior. In providing a Skorokhod decomposition\nof the constructed process we are able to justify that the stochastic process\nis solving the underlying stochastic differential equation weakly in the sense\nof N.

The present study revealed substantial differences in\nthe electronic structure for the two TiGePt modifications, although they have\nthe same nominal composition and show similar electron counts for particular\nvalence band states.

It produces the\ninitial dense gas seeds out of which new stars can form. However, the exact\nrelation between gas compression, turbulent Mach number, and magnetic field\nstrength is still poorly understood. Here, we introduce and test an analytical\nprediction for the relation between the density variance and the\nroot-mean-square Mach number in supersonic, isothermal, magnetised turbulent\nflows.

We obtain the density contrast\nconsidering the momentum equation for a single magnetised shock and extrapolate\nthis result to the entire cloud. Depending on the field geometry, we then make\nthree different assumptions based on observational and theoretical constraints:\nB independent of density, B proportional to the root square of the density and\nB proportional to the density. We test the analytically derived density\nvariance--Mach number relation with numerical simulations, and find that for B\nproportional to the root square of the density, the variance in the logarithmic\ndensity contrast, $\\sigma_{\\ln\n\\rho/\\rho_0}^2=\\ln[1+b^2\\mathscr{M}^2\\beta_0/(\\beta_0+1)]$, fits very well to\nsimulated data with turbulent forcing parameter b=0.4, when the gas is\nsuper-Alfv\\'enic.

We focus on the\nperiastron passage of the binary and calculate the variation of the synchrotron\nand inverse-Compton emissions using the simulated shock geometry and pressure\ndistribution of the pulsar wind. The characteristic double-peaked X-ray light\ncurve from observations is reproduced by our simulation under a dense Be disk\ncondition (base density ~10^{-9} g cm^{-3}). We interpret the pre- and\npost-periastron peaks as being due to a significant increase in the conversion\nefficiency from pulsar spin down power to the shock-accelerated particle energy\nat orbital phases when the pulsar crosses the disk before periastron passage,\nand when the pulsar wind creates a cavity in the disk gas after periastron\npassage, respectively. On the contrary, in the model TeV light curve, which\nalso shows a double peak feature, the first peak appears around the periastron\nphase. The possible effects of cooling processes on the TeV light curve are\nbriefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 03:23:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 10:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This has been proved by\nunifying theories of chemical kinetics, which are transition state theory,\ncollision theory, RRKM and Marcus theory, with the special theory of\nrelativity. Boltzmann constant and energy spacing between permitted quantum\nlevels of molecules are quantum mechanically proved to be Lorentz variant. The\nrelativistic statistical thermodynamics has been developed to explain\nquasiequilibrium existing between reactants and activated complex. The newly\nformulated Lorentz transformation of the rate constant from Arrhenius Equation,\nof the collision frequency and of the Eyring and Marcus equations renders the\nrate law also Lorentz variant. For a moving observer moving at fractions of the\nspeed of light along the reaction coordinate the transition state possess less\nkinetic energy to sweep translation over it. This results in the slower\ntransformation of reactants into products and in a stretched time frame for the\nchemical reaction. Lorentz transformation of the half-life equation explains\ntime dilation of the half life period of chemical reactions and proves special\ntheory of relativity and presents theory of relativistic chemical kinetics in\naccord with each other. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the present theory,\nthe enzymatic reaction of methylamine dehydrogenase and radioactive\ndisintegration of Astatine are considered as numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 16:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2012 06:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 12:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}
