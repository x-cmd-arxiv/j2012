We explore the impacts on\nselection using galaxy color, projected separation from the cluster center, and\ngalaxy luminosity. We study the relationship between cluster mass and velocity\ndispersion and identify and characterize the following sources of bias and\nscatter: halo triaxiality, dynamical friction of red luminous galaxies and\ninterlopers. We show that due to halo triaxiality the intrinsic scatter of\nestimated line of sight dynamical mass is about three times larger (30-40%)\nthan the one estimated using the 3D velocity dispersion (~12%) and a small bias\n(~1%) is induced. We find evidence of increasing scatter as a function of\nredshift and provide a fitting formula to account for it. We characterize the\namount of bias and scatter introduced by dynamical friction when using\nsubsamples of red-luminous galaxies to estimate the velocity dispersion.

The compression-based approach (Boulle, 2007) overcomes this\nproblem, averaging over the different models by applying a logarithmic\nsmoothing over the models' posterior probabilities. This approach has shown\nexcellent performances when applied to ensembles of naive Bayes classifiers.\nAODE is another ensemble of models with high performance (Webb, 2005), based on\na collection of non-naive classifiers (called SPODE) whose probabilistic\npredictions are aggregated by simple arithmetic mean. Aggregating the SPODEs\nvia BMA rather than by arithmetic mean deteriorates the performance; instead,\nwe aggregate the SPODEs via the compression coefficients and we show that the\nresulting classifier obtains a slight but consistent improvement over AODE.\nHowever, an important issue in any Bayesian ensemble of models is the\narbitrariness in the choice of the prior over the models. We address this\nproblem by the paradigm of credal classification, namely by substituting the\nunique prior with a set of priors. Credal classifier automatically recognize\nthe prior-dependent instances, namely the instances whose most probable class\nvaries, when different priors are considered; in these cases, credal\nclassifiers remain reliable by returning a set of classes rather than a single\nclass. We thus develop the credal version of both the BMA-based and the\ncompression-based ensemble of SPODEs, substituting the single prior over the\nmodels by a set of priors. Experiments show that both credal classifiers\nprovide higher classification reliability than their determinate counterparts;\nmoreover the compression-based credal classifier compares favorably to previous\ncredal classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 16:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 10:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The form of\nthe SSA interface is simple: clients first query the global resource registry\nto find services of interest and then issue a data discovery query to selected\nservices to determine what relevant data is available from each service; the\ncandidate datasets available are described uniformly in a VOTable format\ndocument which is returned in response to the query. Finally, the client may\nretrieve selected datasets for analysis. Spectrum datasets returned by an SSA\nspectrum service may be either precomputed, archival datasets, or they may be\nvirtual data which is computed on the fly to respond to a client request.\nSpectrum datasets may conform to a standard data model defined by SSA, or may\nbe native spectra with custom project-defined content. Spectra may be returned\nin any of a number of standard data formats. Spectral data is generally stored\nexternally to the VO in a format specific to each spectral data collection;\ncurrently there is no standard way to represent astronomical spectra, and\nvirtually every project does it differently. Hence spectra may be actively\nmediated to the standard SSA-defined data model at access time by the service,\nso that client analysis programs do not have to be familiar with the\nidiosyncratic details of each data collection to be accessed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 16:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

When Dirac added potentials to his\nfree electron equation, there were two alternatives (here called D1 and D2). He\nchose D1 and lost charge conjugation symmetry, found Ehrenfest equations that\ndepended on the sign of the energy of the state determining the expectation\nvalue, encountered Klein tunneling, zitterbewegung and the Klein paradox. The\nD1 alternative also predicted that deep potentials should pull positive energy\nstates down into the negative energy continuum, possibly creating an unstable\nvacuum. Extensive experiments (1975-1997) found no evidence for this\ninstability, but did find low energy electron-positron pairs with sharply\ndefined energies and unusually low counting statistics. These pairs tended to\ndisappear with higher beam currents. This paper explores the other alternative,\nhere called D2 and finds charge conjugation symmetry preserved, Ehrenfest\nequations are classical, Klein tunneling is not present, unstable vacuua are\nforbidden, zitterbewegung is absent in the charge current density, new\nexcitations of bound electron-positron pairs are possible in atoms, and the\nenergies at which low energy electron-positron pair production in heavy ion\nscattering occurs is well described.

The virtual photons have a non-zero mass and convert into\nlepton-antilepton pairs. Therefore, information about the quarks' spatial\ndistribution inside the meson can be extracted from the lepton-antilepton\ninvariant mass distributions by comparing the empirical results with QED\npredictions, which are based on the assumption that the meson is a point-like\nparticle.

The purpose of this note is to expand on\nthat result. The expected $L^1$ distance is bounded by $c_nn^{-1}$ with\n$\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}c_n \\leq 2^{d+1}||\\nabla f||_1$ for every $f \\in\nW_{1,1}(B_L) \\cap L^{\\infty}(B_L)$.

The rate $n^{-1}$ is best possible: $n$ times the measure of the symmetric\ndifference between the random polarization of a ball and its corresponding\nSchwarz symmetrization converges in distribution. A new sequence of random\npolarizations is introduced such that the transition probability depends on the\nstate of the underlying Markov chain. For a general measurable set $A$\ncontained in $B_L$, the rate of convergence to $A^*$ matches the rate for the\naforementioned random sequence first introduced by Buchard and Fortier.\nHowever, the rate of convergence is $O(n^{-3/2})$ for compact sets in\n$\\mathbb{R}$ with finite perimeter and is exponential for balls in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$. To conclude, it is shown that there exists a family of\nmeasurable sets in $\\mathbb{R}$ admitting a sequence of polarizations\nconverging exponentially to the corresponding Schwarz symmetrization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 18:51:07 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 17:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2018 13:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2022 16:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 18:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 02:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 15:04:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 00:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 00:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 06:14:16 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 05:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 18:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 20:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

It was shown by Koike-Akino et. al. that\nadaptively changing the network coding map used at the relay according to the\nchannel conditions greatly reduces the impact of multiple access interference\nwhich occurs at the relay during the MA phase. Depending on the signal set used\nat the end nodes, deep fades occur for a finite number of channel fade states\nreferred as the singular fade states. The singular fade states fall into the\nfollowing two classes: The ones which are caused due to channel outage and\nwhose harmful effect cannot be mitigated by adaptive network coding are\nreferred as the \\textit{non-removable singular fade states}. The ones which\noccur due to the choice of the signal set and whose harmful effects can be\nremoved by a proper choice of the adaptive network coding map are referred as\nthe \\textit{removable} singular fade states.

Here we explore disk-satellite interaction in disks\nwith gaps in linear approximation both in Fourier and in physical space,\nexplicitly incorporating the disk non-uniformity in the fluid equations.\nDensity gradients strongly displace the positions of Lindblad resonances in the\ndisk (which often occur at multiple locations), and the waveforms of modes\nexcited close to the gap edge get modified compared to the uniform disk case.\nThe spatial distribution of the excitation torque density is found to be quite\ndifferent from the existing prescriptions: most of the torque is exerted in a\nrather narrow region near the gap edge where Lindblad resonances accumulate,\nfollowed by an exponential fall-off with the distance from the perturber.\nDespite these differences, for a given gap profile the full integrated torque\nexerted on the disk agrees with the conventional uniform disk theory prediction\nat the level of ~10%. The nonlinearity of the density wave excited by the\nperturber is shown to decrease as the wave travels out of the gap, slowing down\nits nonlinear evolution and damping.

One suggested way to have\nrecombining plasma in a supernova remnant is to have a dense circumstellar\nmedium at the time of the supernova explosion. If the circumstellar medium is\ndense enough, collisional ionization equilibrium can be established in the\nearly stage of the evolution of the supernova remnant and subsequent adiabatic\ncooling which occurs after the shock wave gets out of the dense circumstellar\nmedium makes the electron temperature lower than the ionization temperature.

We use archival HST/ACS data and apply synthetic\ncolor-magnitude diagram fitting in order to reconstruct the past star formation\nactivity of the target galaxies. The average star formation rate for the\nstudied galaxies ranges from 10^{-3} up to \\sim 7x10^{-2} M_odot/yr, and their\nmean metallicities correlate with their luminosities (from [Fe/H]\\sim -1.4 up\nto \\sim -1.0). The form of the star formation histories varies across the\nsample, with quiescent periods alternating with intermittent enhancements in\nthe star formation (from a few up to several times the average lifetime value).\nThe dwarfs in this sample formed ~35% to ~60% of their stellar content prior to\n~5 Gyr ago. The resulting star formation histories for the CenA companions are\nsimilar to those found for comparable Local Group and M81 group dwarfs. We\nconsider this sample of dwarfs together with 5 previously studied M83 dwarf\nirregular companions. We find no trend of the average star formation rate with\ntidal index or distance from the main galaxy of the group. However, dwarfs with\nhigher baryonic masses do show higher average star formation rates, underlining\nthe importance of intrinsic properties in governing the evolution of these\ngalaxies. On the other hand, there is also a clear trend when looking at the\nrecent (~0.5-1 Gyr) level of activity. Namely, dwarfs within a denser region of\nthe group appear to have had their star formation quenched while dwarfs located\nin the group outskirts show a wide range of possible star formation rates, thus\nindicating that external processes play a fundamental role, complementary to\nmass, in shaping the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 20:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The\nshape of the ICMF at high masses can be studied using the most massive young\n(<10 Myr) clusters, however this has proven difficult due to low-number\nstatistics. In this contribution we use an alternative method based on the\nluminosities of the brightest clusters, combined with their ages. If a\ntruncation is present, a generic prediction (nearly independent of the cluster\ndisruption law adopted) is that the median age of bright clusters should be\nyounger than that of fainter clusters. In the case of an non-truncated ICMF,\nthe median age should be independent of cluster luminosity. Here, we present\noptical spectroscopy of twelve young stellar clusters in the face-on spiral\ngalaxy NGC 2997. The spectra are used to estimate the age of each cluster, and\nthe brightness of the clusters is taken from the literature. The observations\nare compared with the model expectations of Larsen (2009) for various ICMF\nforms and both mass dependent and mass independent cluster disruption. While\nthere exists some degeneracy between the truncation mass and the amount of mass\nindependent disruption, the observations favour a truncated ICMF. For low or\nmodest amounts of mass independent disruption, a truncation mass of 5-6*10^5\nMsun is estimated, consistent with previous determinations. Additionally, we\ninvestigate possible truncations in the ICMF in the spiral galaxy M83, the\ninteracting Antennae galaxies, and the collection of spiral and dwarf galaxies\npresent in Larsen (2009) based on photometric catalogues taken from the\nliterature, and find that all catalogues are consistent with having a\n(environmentally dependent) truncation in the cluster mass functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 21:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A large class of estimators of functionals of the\nprobability density suffer from the curse of dimensionality, wherein the mean\nsquared error (MSE) decays increasingly slowly as a function of the sample size\n$T$ as the dimension $d$ of the samples increases. In particular, the rate is\noften glacially slow of order $O(T^{-{\\gamma}/{d}})$, where $\\gamma>0$ is a\nrate parameter. Examples of such estimators include kernel density estimators,\n$k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) density estimators, $k$-NN entropy estimators,\nintrinsic dimension estimators and other examples. In this paper, we propose a\nweighted affine combination of an ensemble of such estimators, where optimal\nweights can be chosen such that the weighted estimator converges at a much\nfaster dimension invariant rate of $O(T^{-1})$. Furthermore, we show that these\noptimal weights can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem\nwhich can be performed offline and does not require training data.

The central results of this\npaper provide a complete description of the subsets of $L_{p}(\\Omega, \\mu)$\nthat have strict $p$-negative type. In order to do this we study non-trivial\n$p$-polygonal equalities in $L_{p}(\\Omega, \\mu)$. These are equalities that\ncan, after appropriate rearrangement and simplification, be expressed in the\nform \\begin{eqnarray*} \\sum\\limits_{j, i = 1}^{n} \\alpha_{j} \\alpha_{i} {\\|\nz_{j} - z_{i} \\|}_{p}^{p} & = & 0 \\end{eqnarray*} where $\\{ z_{1}, \\ldots,\nz_{n} \\}$ is a subset of $L_{p}(\\Omega, \\mu)$ and $\\alpha_{1}, \\ldots,\n\\alpha_{n}$ are non-zero real numbers that sum to zero.

This is a continuation of previous studies using the DBW2\ngauge action and naive staggered fermions. With the use of the force gradient\nintegrator and a multiple-quark-mass preconditioned HMC, we have done\nsimulations with input quark masses from $m_q=0.003$ to $m_q=0.008$. We have\nobserved a metastable, first order, bulk transition that occurs at small input\nquark masses. As the quark mass increases, this first order bulk transition\nends at a second order critical point, and, for still heavier quark masses,\nbecomes the cross-over we have previously reported. We present measurements of\nhadron masses, decay constants and other low energy observables in the small\nquark mass region on the weak coupling side of the bulk transition. Our results\nshow that the behavior of the system is still consistent with spontaneously\nbroken chiral symmetry. We also discuss a preliminary investigation into the\nbehavior of the bulk transition itself. We have found that, as the system\napproaches the second order critical end point, the scalar singlet meson\nbecomes lighter. Thus it appears that the critical endpoint corresponds to a\ncontinuum limit theory only involving scalars and, following known triviality\narguments, this is likely a free field theory. The presence of this critical\nendpoint could influence scaling of lattice observables in the conventional\ncontinuum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 01:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-28"}

Our consideration is confined\nto the one-dimensional model for continuous random motion of a particle with\ninertia. Its dynamics governed by stochastic self-acceleration is described as\nmotion on the phase plane {x,v} comprising the position x and velocity v=dx/dt\nof the given particle. A notion of random walks inside a certain neighbourhood\nL of the line v=0 (the x-axis) and outside it is developed. It enables us to\nrepresent a continuous trajectory of particle motion on the plane {x,v} as a\ncollection of the corresponding discrete steps. Each of these steps matches one\ncomplete fragment of the velocity fluctuations originating and terminating at\nthe \"boundary\" of L. As demonstrated, the characteristic length of particle\nspatial displacement is mainly determined by velocity fluctuations with large\namplitude, which endows the derived random walks along the x-axis with the\ncharacteristic properties of Levy flights. Using the developed classification\nof random trajectories a certain parameter-free core stochastic process is\nconstructed. Its peculiarity is that all the characteristics of Levy flights\nsimilar to the exponent of the Levy scaling law are no more than the parameters\nof the corresponding transformation from the particle velocity v to the related\nvariable of the core process. In this way the previously found validity of the\ncontinuous Markovian model for all the regimes of Levy flights is explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 03:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 05:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We show that this transverse component is of\npurely quantum-mechanical origin and that its direction in the plane normal to\nthe c-axis is not detectable, even in principle, in experiments, at least in\nthe quantum-mechanical model we have adopted. We estimate the direction of the\n\"tilt\" in the moment, i.e. the ratio of the transverse component to the c-axis\ncomponent, using parameters of the ground state obtained by fitting to the\nobserved dispersion of the collective modes in the ordered state. We can obtain\nreasonable agreement with experiments but only by introducing a parameter for\nwhich only an approximate magnitude can be estimated. Approximate calculations\nof the form-factors are also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 04:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 05:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Suppose we have many point\nsources at unknown locations in $[0,1]$ and with unknown complex-valued\namplitudes. We only observe Fourier samples of this object up until a frequency\ncut-off $f_c$. We show that one can super-resolve these point sources with\ninfinite precision---i.e. recover the exact locations and amplitudes---by\nsolving a simple convex optimization problem, which can essentially be\nreformulated as a semidefinite program. This holds provided that the distance\nbetween sources is at least $2/f_c$. This result extends to higher dimensions\nand other models.

The calculations are done for two\ndifferent potential surfaces: one of them is an Eckart Barrier and the other\none is a double well potential surface. Numerical convergence of the series are\ninvestigated. Although the zeroth order term is sufficient at high\ntemperatures, it does not lead to the correct saddle point structure at low\ntemperatures where the tunneling is important. Nevertheless the series\nconverges rapidly even at low temperatures. Some of the double well\ncalculations are also done with the bare potential (without Gaussian\naveraging). Some equations of motion related with bare potentials are also\nderived. The use of the bare potential results in faster integrations of\nequations of motion. Although, it causes lower accuracy in the zeroth order\napproximation, the series show similar convergence properties both for Gaussian\naveraged calculations and the bare potential calculations.

The answer can be considered\nas a quantization of the \\sigma_R = \\sigma_{[1]}^{|R|} identity for the\n\"special\" polynomials (they define the leading asymptotics of HOMFLY at q=1),\nand arises in a form, convenient for comparison with the representation of the\nJones polynomials as sums of dilogarithm ratios. In particular, we construct a\ndifference equation (\"non-commutative A-polynomial\") in the representation\nvariable p. Simple symmetry transformation provides also a formula for\narbitrary antisymmetric (fundamental) representation R=[1^p], which also passes\nsome obvious checks. Also straightforward is a deformation from HOMFLY to\nsuperpolynomials.

In particular, we focus on the stability of\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov, dimer and trimer fluids in inhomogeneous\nsituations, as typically realized in cold gas experiments due to the harmonic\nconfinement.

Model electrostatics in voltage-clamped boundary conditions\nare solved using a boundary element method. The statistical mechanical\nconsequences of the electrostatic configurational energy are computed to gain\ninsight into the sliding-helix mechanism and to predict experimentally measured\nensemble properties such as gating charge displaced by an applied voltage.\nThose consequences and ensemble properties are investigated for two alternate\nS4 configurations, \\alpha- and 3(10)-helical. Both forms of VS are found to\nhave an inherent electrostatic stability. Maximal charge displacement is\nlimited by geometry, specifically the range of movement where S4 charges and\ncounter-charges overlap in the region of weak dielectric. Charge displacement\nresponds more steeply to voltage in the \\alpha-helical than the 3(10)-helical\nsensor. This difference is due to differences on the order of 0.1 eV in the\nlandscapes of electrostatic energy. As a step toward integrating these VS\nmodels into a full-channel model, we include a hypothetical external load in\nthe Hamiltonian of the system and analyze the energetic in/output relation of\nthe VS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 13:40:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 23:08:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 21:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 08:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}
