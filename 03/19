Such an experimental approach is sorely missing for NP-hard control\nproblems, where control refers to attempts to tamper with the outcome of\nelections by adding/deleting/partitioning either voters or candidates. We\nexperimentally tackle NP-hard control problems for Bucklin and fallback voting.\nAmong natural voting systems with efficient winner determination, fallback\nvoting is currently known to display the broadest resistance to control in\nterms of NP-hardness, and Bucklin voting has been shown to behave almost as\nwell in terms of control resistance [ER10, EPR11, EFPR11]. We also investigate\ncontrol resistance experimentally for plurality voting, one of the first voting\nsystems analyzed with respect to electoral control [BTT92, HHR07]. Our findings\nindicate that NP-hard control problems can often be solved effectively in\npractice. Moreover, our experiments allow a more fine-grained analysis and\ncomparison-across various control scenarios, vote distribution models, and\nvoting systems-than merely stating NP-hardness for all these control problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2012 16:10:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 13:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

It leads to new challenges that often\nrequire innovation of paradigms and practices at all levels: technical,\ncultural, legal, regulatory, and social. The key problem in mapping Web\napplications to virtualized Cloud services is selecting the best and compatible\nmix of software images (e.g., Web server image) and infrastructure services to\nensure that Quality of Service (QoS) targets of an application are achieved.\nThe fact that, when selecting Cloud services, engineers must consider\nheterogeneous sets of criteria and complex dependencies between infrastructure\nservices and software images, which are impossible to resolve manually, is a\ncritical issue.

To meet the hard deadlines of real-time traffic,\nit is critical to strike a balance between maximizing the throughput and\nminimizing the risk that the entire block of coded packets may not be decodable\nby the deadline. Thus motivated, we explore adaptive NC, where the block size\nis adapted based on the remaining time to the deadline, by casting this\nsequential block size adaptation problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision\nprocess. One interesting finding is that the optimal block size and its\ncorresponding action space monotonically decrease as the deadline approaches,\nand the optimal block size is bounded by the \"greedy\" block size. These unique\nstructures make it possible to narrow down the search space of dynamic\nprogramming, building on which we develop a monotonicity-based backward\ninduction algorithm (MBIA) that can solve for the optimal block size in\npolynomial time. Since channel erasure probabilities would be time-varying in a\nmobile network, we further develop a joint real-time scheduling and channel\nlearning scheme with adaptive NC that can adapt to channel dynamics. We also\ngeneralize the analysis to multiple flows with hard deadlines and long-term\ndelivery ratio constraints, devise a low-complexity online scheduling algorithm\nintegrated with the MBIA, and then establish its asymptotical\nthroughput-optimality.

However, central\nperturbations of high-magnification events caused by a planet can also be\nproduced by a very close or a very wide binary companion, and the two kinds of\ncentral perturbations are not generally distinguished without time consuming\ndetailed modeling (a planet-binary degeneracy). Hence, it is important to\nresolve the planet-binary degeneracy that occurs in high-magnification events.\nIn this paper, we investigate caustic-crossing high-magnification events caused\nby a planet and a wide binary companion. From this study, we find that because\nof the different magnification excess patterns inside the central caustics\ninduced by the planet and the binary companion, the light curves of the\ncaustic-crossing planetary-lensing events exhibit a feature that is\ndiscriminated from those of the caustic-crossing binary-lensing events, and the\nfeature can be used to immediately distinguish between the planetary and binary\ncompanions. The planetary-lensing feature appears in the interpeak region\nbetween the two peaks of the caustic-crossings. The structure of the interpeak\nregion for the planetary-lensing events is smooth and convex or boxy, whereas\nthe structure for the binary-lensing events is smooth and concave. We also\ninvestigate the effect of a finite background source star on the\nplanetary-lensing feature in the caustic-crossing high-magnification events.\nFrom this, we find that the convex-shaped interpeak structure appears in a\ncertain range that changes with the mass ratio of the planet to the\nplanet-hosting star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 01:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A new atmospheric parameterization is introduced that is applicable to\ngeneral atmospheres in which the main constituent is not known a priori and\nclouds may be present. Our main finding is that a unique constraint of the\nmixing ratios of the absorbers and up to two spectrally inactive gases (such as\nN2 and primordial H2+He) is possible if the observations are sufficient to\nquantify both (1) the broadband transit depths in at least one absorption\nfeature for each absorber and (2) the slope and strength of the molecular\nRayleigh scattering signature.

In our library, not only\nthe Newton's forces, but also central forces with an arbitrary shape f(r),\nwhich has a finite cutoff radius r_cut (i.e. f(r)=0 at r>r_cut), can be quickly\ncomputed. Using an Intel Core i7--2600 processor, we measure the performance of\nour library for both the forces.

Two of the\nchallenging questions in such environments are (1) choosing suitable values for\nMapReduce configuration parameters -e.g., number of mappers, number of\nreducers, and DFS block size-, and (2) predicting the amount of resources that\na user should lease from the service provider. Currently, the tasks of both\nchoosing configuration parameters and estimating required resources are solely\nthe users' responsibilities. In this paper, we present an approach to provision\nthe total CPU usage in clock cycles of jobs in MapReduce environment. For a\nMapReduce job, a profile of total CPU usage in clock cycles is built from the\njob past executions with different values of two configuration parameters e.g.,\nnumber of mappers, and number of reducers. Then, a polynomial regression is\nused to model the relation between these configuration parameters and total CPU\nusage in clock cycles of the job. We also briefly study the influence of input\ndata scaling on measured total CPU usage in clock cycles. This derived model\nalong with the scaling result can then be used to provision the total CPU usage\nin clock cycles of the same jobs with different input data size. We validate\nthe accuracy of our models using three realistic applications (WordCount, Exim\nMainLog parsing, and TeraSort). Results show that the predicted total CPU usage\nin clock cycles of generated resource provisioning options are less than 8% of\nthe measured total CPU usage in clock cycles in our 20-node virtual Hadoop\ncluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 09:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 01:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}

We\ninvestigate the structures with different radial velocities in the knots of the\nHL Tau jet as well as its unusual behaviour starting from 20 arcsec from the\nsource. Collation of radial velocity data with proper motion measurements of\nemission structures in the jet of HL Tau makes it possible to understand the\norigin of these structures and decide on the mechanism for the formation of the\nknotty structures in Herbig-Haro flows. We present observations obtained with a\n6 m telescope (Russia) using the SCORPIO camera with scanning Fabry-Perot\ninterferometer. Two epochs of the observations of the HL/XZ Tau region in\nHalpha emission (2001 and 2007) allowed us to measure proper motions for high\nand low radial velocity structures. The structures with low and high radial\nvelocities in the HL Tau jet show the same proper motion. The point where the\nHL Tau jet bents to the north (it coincides with the trailing edge of so-called\nknot A) is stationary, i.e. does not have any perceptible proper motion and is\nvisible in Halpha emission only. We conclude that the high- and low- velocity\nstructures in the HL Tau jet represent bow-shocks and Mach disks in the\ninternal working surfaces of episodic outflows. The bend of the jet and the\nbrightness increase starting some distance from the source coincides with the\nobserved stationary deflecting shock. The increase of relative surface\nbrightness of bow-shocks could be the result of the abrupt change of the\nphysical conditions of the ambient medium as well as the interaction of a\nhighly collimated flow and the side wind from XZ Tau.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 10:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 18:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Several spaces are found which have CMB\ncorrelations on angular scales theta >= 60^\\circ suppressed by a factor of two\ncompared to the simply connected S^3 space. The analysis is based on the S\nstatistics, and a comparison to the WMAP 7yr data is carried out. Although the\nCMB suppression is less pronounced than in the Poincare dodecahedral space,\nthese lens spaces provide an alternative worth for follow-up studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 12:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 12:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It is shown that the resulting symmetry operators expressed in terms\nof Dirac matrices cannot be described exclusively in terms of gamma matrices\n(and their products) entering the corresponding Dirac equation. It is a\nconsequence of the reducibility of the considered representation in contrast to\nthe 3+1-dimensional case.

Similar to\nother accreting pulsars, the stability of the pulse phases determined by using\nthe second harmonic component is higher than that of the phases based on the\nfundamental frequency. Under the assumption that the second harmonic is a good\ntracer of the neutron star spin frequency, we successfully model its evolution\nin terms of a luminosity dependent accretion torque. If the NS accretes the\nspecific Keplerian angular momentum of the in-flowing matter, we estimate the\ninner disc radius to lie between 47 and 93 km when the luminosity attains its\npeak value. Smaller values are obtained if the interaction between the magnetic\nfield lines and the plasma in the disc is considered.\n  The phase-averaged spectrum is described by thermal Comptonization of photons\nwith energy of ~1 keV. A hard to soft state transition is observed during the\noutburst rise. The Comptonized spectrum evolves from a Comptonizing cloud at an\nelectron temperature of ~20 keV towards an optically denser cloud at kT_e~3\nkeV. At the same time, the pulse amplitude decreases from 27% to few per cent\nand becomes strongly energy dependent.

This is in apparent contradiction with the LCDM\nsimulations of the Aquarius Project, which suggest that MW-sized halos should\nhave at least 8 subhalos with V_max>30km/s. The absence of luminous satellites\nin such massive subhalos is thus puzzling and may present a challenge to the\nLCDM paradigm. We note, however, that the number of massive subhalos depends\nsensitively on the (poorly-known) virial mass of the Milky Way, and that their\nscarcity makes estimates of their abundance from a small simulation set like\nAquarius uncertain. We use the Millennium Simulation series and the invariance\nof the scaled subhalo velocity function (i.e., the number of subhalos as a\nfunction of \\nu, the ratio of subhalo V_max to host halo virial velocity,\nV_200) to secure improved estimates of the abundance of rare massive\nsubsystems. In the range 0.1<\\nu<0.5, N_sub(>\\nu) is approximately\nPoisson-distributed about an average given by <N_sub>=10.2x(\\nu/0.15)^(-3.11).\nThis is slightly lower than in Aquarius halos, but consistent with recent\nresults from the Phoenix Project. The probability that a LCDM halo has 3 or\nfewer subhalos with V_max above some threshold value, V_th, is then\nstraightforward to compute. It decreases steeply both with decreasing V_th and\nwith increasing halo mass. For V_th=30km/s, ~40% of M_halo=10^12 M_sun halos\npass the test; fewer than 5% do so for M_halo>= 2x10^12 M_sun; and the\nprobability effectively vanishes for M_halo>= 3x 10^12 M_sun.

The central stars are modeled by MARCS model atmospheres. In a first\nstep, the best-fit MARCS model is derived, determining the effective\ntemperature. In a second step, models with a finite dust optical depth are\nfitted and it is determined whether the reduction in chi2 in such models with\none additional free parameter is statistically significant.\n  23 stars are found to have a significant infrared excess, which is\ninterpreted as mass loss. The dust optical depths are translated into mass-loss\nrates assuming a typical expansion velocity of 10 km/s and a dust-to-gas ratio\nof 0.005.\n  The mass-loss rates are compared to those derived for luminous stars in\nglobular clusters, by fitting both the infrared excess, as in the present\npaper, and the chromospheric lines. There is excellent agreement between these\nvalues and the mass-loss rates derived from the chromospheric activity. There\nis a systematic difference with the literature mass-loss rates derived from\nmodeling the infrared excess, and this has been traced to technical details on\nhow the DUSTY radiative transfer model is run.\n  If the present results are combined with those from modeling the\nchromospheric emission lines, we obtain the fits Log Mdot = (1.0 +- 0.3) Log L\n+ (-12.0 +- 0.9) and Log Mdot = (0.6 +- 0.2) Log (LR/M) + (-11.9 +- 0.9).\n  The predictions of these mass-loss rate formula are tested against the RGB\nmass loss determination in NGC 6791.

The performance of the proposed algorithm is\nanalysed using Interleaving-KV sample coding & error correction in Rayleigh and\nRician channel using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system\nunder the severe multipath fading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 04:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-21"}

Persistence\ntimes, defined as the timespans occurring between species' colonization and\nlocal extinction in a given geographic region, are empirically estimated from\nlocal observations of species' presence/absence. A connected sampling problem\nis presented, generalized and solved analytically. Species persistence is shown\nto provide a direct connection with key spatial macroecological patterns like\nspecies-area and endemics-area relationships. Our empirical analysis pertains\nto two different ecosystems and taxa: a herbaceous plant community and a\nestuarine fish database. Despite the substantial differences in ecological\ninteractions and spatial scales, we confirm earlier evidence on the general\nproperties of the scaling of persistence times, including the predicted effects\nof the structure of the spatial interaction network. The framework tested here\nallows to investigate directly nature and extent of spatial effects in the\ncontext of ecosystem dynamics. The notable coherence between spatial and\ntemporal macroecological patterns, theoretically derived and empirically\nverified, is suggested to underlie general features of the dynamic evolution of\necosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 09:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-21"}

The friendly and malicious nodes detection is based on\nthe integrated key consisting of symmetric keys, geographic location and round\ntrip response time. Two strictly friend references dynamically form the\ntracking zone over the detected multiple malicious nodes using the\nmulti-sectored adaptive beam forming. This PL&T technique is robust, precise,\nscalable, and faster than using the single reference, two reference and three\nreference nodes based PL&T method in the battlefield oriented Mobile Ad hoc\nNetworks. The simulation results show that the lower relative speed bound of\nany participating node increased the switching overhead, the decreasing\nreceived energy with increasing number of the multi-sectored beams reduced\ntracking accuracy and the strict friendly authentication overhead depends upon\nthe time period between two latest periodic authentication failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 05:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-21"}
