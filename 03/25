We analyze the surroundings of HD 97300, one of two intermediate-mass\nstars in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region.

We present infrared images taken with Herschel and Spitzer using 11\ndifferent broad-band filters between 3.6 um and 500 um. We compare the\nmorphology of the emission using cuts along different position angles. We\nconstruct spectral energy distributions, which we compare to different dust\nmodels, and calculate dust temperatures. We also derive opacity maps and\nanalyze the density structure of the environment of HD 97300.\n  Results. We find that HD 97300 has no infrared excess at or below 24 um,\nconfirming its zero-age main-sequence nature. The morphology of the ring is\nvery similar between 3.6 um and 24 um. The emission at these wavelengths is\ndominated by either PAH features or PAH continuum. At longer wavelengths, only\nthe northwestern part of the ring is visible. A fit to the 100-500 um\nobservations suggests that the emission is due to relatively warm (~26 K) dust.\nThe temperature gradually decreases with increasing distance from the ring. We\nfind a general decrease in the density from north to south, and an approximate\n10% density increase in the northeastern part of the ring.\n  Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the theory that the ring around\nHD 97300 is essentially a bubble blown into the surrounding interstellar matter\nand heated by the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 18:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-11"}

As a consequence, smart charging\nstrategies are crucial for the secure and reliable operation of the power\nsystem. This paper tries to achieve high penetration level of PEVs with the\nexisting distribution system infrastructure by proposing a smart charging\nalgorithm that can optimally utilize the distribution system capacity.\nSpecifically, the paper proposes a max-weight PEV dispatch algorithm to control\nthe PEV charging rates, subject to power system physical limits. The proposed\nmax-weight PEV dispatch algorithm is proved to be throughput optimal under very\nmild assumptions on the stochastic dynamics in the system. This suggests that\nthe costly distribution system infrastructure upgrade can be avoided, or\nfailing that, at least successfully deferred. The proposed PEV dispatch\nalgorithm is particularly attractive in integrating the renewable energy\nsources in the distribution system, by successfully absorbing their\nintermittency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 21:46:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 20:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

For a single disordered Rashba\nwire, it is found that the charge conductance quantization is destroyed by the\nedge disorder. However, a nonzero spin conductance can be generated and its\namplitude can be manipulated by the wire length, which is attributed to the\nbroken structure symmetries and the spin-dependent quantum interference induced\nby the rough boundaries.

For this class of\nprocesses, we propose a compressive estimator of the discrete Rihaczek spectrum\n(RS).

Within this work we investigate the\nrelation between current sheets and vortex sheets in incompressible, stationary\nequilibria. For this approach it is helpful that the similar mathematical\nstructure of magnetohydrostatics and stationary incompressible hydrodynamics\nallows us to transform static equilibria into stationary ones. The main control\nfunction for such a transformation is the profile of the Alfven-Mach number\nM_A, which is always constant along magnetic field lines, but can change from\none field line to another. In the case of a global constant M_A, vortices and\nelectric current concentrations are parallel. More interesting is the nonlinear\ncase, where M_A varies perpendicular to the field lines. This is a typical\nsituation at boundary layers like the magnetopause, heliopause, the solar wind\nflowing around helmet streamers and at the boundary of solar coronal holes. The\ncorresponding current and vortex sheets show in some cases also an alignment,\nbut not in every case. For special density distributions in 2D it is possible\nto have current but no vortex sheets. In 2D vortex sheets of field\naligned-flows can also exist without strong current sheets, taking the limit of\nsmall Alfven Mach numbers into account. The current sheet can vanish if the\nAlfven Mach number is (almost) constant and the density gradient is large\nacross some boundary layer. It should be emphasized that the used theory is not\nonly valid for small Alfven Mach numbers M_A<<1, but also for M_A~1.

We\npresent a recipe for constructing an astrosphere with the help of only a few\nparameters, like the inner Alfven Mach number and the outer Alfven Mach number,\nthe magnetic field strength within and outside the stellar wind cavity, and the\ndistribution of singular points of the magnetic field within these flows.\nWithin the framework of a one-fluid approximation, it is possible to obtain\nsolutions of the MHD equations for stationary flows from corresponding static\nMHD equilibria, by using noncanonical mappings of the canonical variables. The\ncanonical variables are the Euler potentials of the magnetic field of\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibria. Thus we start from static equilibria determined\nby the distribution of magnetic neutral points, and assume that the Alfven Mach\nnumber for the corresponding stationary equilibria is finite. The topological\nstructure determines the geometrical structure of the interstellar gas -\nstellar wind interface. Additional boundary conditions like the outer magnetic\nfield and the jump of the magnetic field across the astropause allow\ndetermination of the noncanonical transformations. This delivers the strength\nof the magnetic field at every point in the astrotail region beyond the reverse\nshock. The mathematical technique for describing such a scenario is applied to\nastrospheres in general, but is also relevant for the heliosphere.

However, these\nbaseband, RF, and audio sections have different requirements that influence\nwhich LDO is most appropriate. After discussion of the specific requirements,\ndifferent LDOs are recommended. Also, some LDO design techniques are briefly\ndiscussed to demonstrate how an LDO may be optimized for a specific level of\nperformance. Cellular phone designs require linear regulators with lowdropout,\nlow-noise, high PSRR, low quiescent current (Iq), and low-cost. They need to\ndeliver a stable output and use smallvalue output capacitors. Ideally, one\ndevice would have all these characteristics and one low-dropout linear\nregulator (LDO) could be used anywhere in the phone without worry.

Starting from the isotope effect and correlations of\nsuperconductivity with electronegativity (\\Chi), valence electron count per\natom (Ne), atomic number(Z) and formula weight (Fw), we derive an empirical\nformula for estimating Tc that includes an unknown parameter,(Ko).
