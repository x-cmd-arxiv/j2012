We\ndescribed this effect with a simple resistive model, in which the tunneling\ncurrent causes a voltage drop at the sample area underneath the probe tip.\nBecause tunneling is a highly local process, the areal current density is quite\nhigh, which leads to an appreciable local voltage drop that in turn changes the\nelectrostatic attraction between tip and sample. However, Si(111)-7\\times7 has\na metallic surface-state and it might be proposed that electrons should instead\npropagate along the surface-state, as through a thin metal film on a\nsemiconducting surface, before propagating into the bulk. In this article, we\ninvestigate the role of the metallic surface-state on the phantom force. First,\nwe show that the phantom force can be observed on H/Si(100), a surface without\na metallic surface-state. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the\nsurface-state on our phantom force observations of Si(111)-7\\times7 by\nanalyzing the influence of the macroscopic tip radius R on the strength of the\nphantom force, where a noticeable effect would be expected if the local voltage\ndrop would reach extensions comparable to the tip radius. We conclude that a\nmetallic surface-state does not suppress the phantom force, but that the local\nresistance Rs has a strong effect on the magnitude of the phantom force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2012 16:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-13"}

One of the most important findings is the\n\"uncombed\" penumbral structure, where a more horizontal magnetic component\ncarrying most of Evershed Flows is embedded in a more vertical magnetic\nbackground (Solanki & Montavon 1993). The penumbral bright grains are locations\nof hot upflows and dark fibrils are locations of horizontal flows that are\nguided by nearly horizontal magnetic field. On the other hand, it was found\nthat flares may change the topology of sunspots in $\\delta$ configuration: the\nstructure at the flaring polarity inversion line becomes darkened while\nsections of peripheral penumbrae may disappear quickly and permanently\nassociated with flares (Liu et al. 2005). The high spatial and temporal\nresolution observations obtained with Hinode/ SOT provide an excellent\nopportunity to study the evolution of penumbral fine structure associated with\nmajor flares. Taking advantage of two near-limb events, we found that in\nsections of peripheral penumbrae swept by flare ribbons, the dark fibrils\ncompletely disappear, while the bright grains evolve into faculae that are\nsignatures of vertical magnetic flux tubes. The corresponding magnetic fluxes\nmeasured in the decaying penumbrae show stepwise changes temporally correlated\nwith the flares. These observations suggest that the horizontal magnetic field\ncomponent of the penumbra could be straightened upward (i.e., turning from\nhorizontal to vertical) due to magnetic field restructuring associated with\nflares, which results in the transition of penumbrae to faculae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2012 17:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-13"}

Passive traffic analysis can link flows but requires long periods\nof observation to reduce errors. Active traffic analysis, also known as flow\nwatermarking, allows for better precision and is more scalable. Previous flow\nwatermarks introduce significant delays to the traffic flow as a side effect of\nusing a blind detection scheme; this enables attacks that detect and remove the\nwatermark, while at the same time slowing down legitimate traffic. We propose\nthe first non-blind approach for flow watermarking, called RAINBOW, that\nimproves watermark invisibility by inserting delays hundreds of times smaller\nthan previous blind watermarks, hence reduces the watermark interference on\nnetwork flows. We derive and analyze the optimum detectors for RAINBOW as well\nas the passive traffic analysis under different traffic models by using\nhypothesis testing. Comparing the detection performance of RAINBOW and the\npassive approach we observe that both RAINBOW and passive traffic analysis\nperform similarly good in the case of uncorrelated traffic, however, the\nRAINBOW detector drastically outperforms the optimum passive detector in the\ncase of correlated network flows. This justifies the use of non-blind\nwatermarks over passive traffic analysis even though both approaches have\nsimilar scalability constraints.

As a\nbyproduct we show that if finitely additive mixed strategies are allowed, then\nWald's game admits an equilibrium. We also prove existence of equilibria for\nnontrivial extensions of matching-pennies and rock-scissors-paper.

The 8.0 and 15 \\micron LFs for the total, unobscured type-1 and\nobscured type-2 AGN are predicted from the HXLFs, and then compared with the\nmeasurements currently available.

The aim of these detection methods is to reduce the effect of\ncochannel interference due to co-frequency access, and consequently, improves\nthe capacity of the mulitbeam communications systems, by improving frequency\nreuse. Channel estimation allows the determination of interference\ncoefficients, which helps their effects compensation. The developed multiuser\ndetections techniques are iterative. Therefore, detection quality is improved\nfrom a stage to another. Moreover, a signals combining method, which is\nintegrated into these detection solutions, enhances their capability. The\nproposed solutions are evaluated through computer simulations, where an\nasynchronous multibeam satellite link is considered over an AWGN channel.

With\nthe aid of the replica method which enables disentanglement of thermal\nfluctuations in liquids into intra-state and inter-state fluctuations, we\nextract the rigidity of metastable amorphous solid states in the supercooled\nliquid and glass phases. The result can be understood intuitively without\nreplicas. As a test case, we apply the scheme to the supercooled and glassy\nstate of a binary mixture of soft-spheres. The result compares well with the\nshear-modulus obtained by a previous molecular dynamic simulation. The rigidity\nof metastable states is significantly reduced with respect to the instantaneous\nrigidity, namely the Born term, due to non-affine responses caused by\ndisplacements of particles inside cages at all temperatures down to T=0. It\nbecomes nearly independent of temperature below the Kauzmann temperature T_K.\nAt higher temperatures in the supercooled liquid state, the non-affine\ncorrection to the rigidity becomes stronger suggesting melting of the\nmetastable solid state. Inter-state part of the static response implies jerky,\nintermittent stress-strain curves with static analogue of yielding at\nmesoscopic scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 15:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 20:15:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 13:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-08"}

To overcome\nthis the conventional data are supplemented with output from a computer\nsimulator. For environmental applications, such as extreme rainfall as we study\nhere, the simulator could be a regional climate model. Annual maxima are\nstudied and assumed to follow the generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution\nand dependence is accommodated between maxima by its parameters following\nGaussian processes. The GEV's parameters are now random and so a modification\nto the Monte Carlo EM algorithm is presented so that the model's parameters can\nbe estimated. Then a variety of checks for the model's goodness of fit are\ngiven. For the extreme rainfall application we find that the model estimates a\nvariety of extremal features of interest well, and then show how specific\nfeatures can be interpolated based on the model so that maps can be produced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 15:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-13"}

The problem\narises in many areas of astronomy, crystallography, optics, and coherent\ndiffraction imaging (CDI). Our main goal is to develop an efficient\nreconstruction method based on continuous optimization techniques. Unlike\ncurrent reconstruction methods, which are based on alternating projections, our\napproach leads to a much faster and more robust method. However, all previous\nattempts to employ continuous optimization methods, such as Newton-type\nalgorithms, to the phase retrieval problem failed. In this work we provide an\nexplanation for this failure, and based on this explanation we devise a\nsufficient condition that allows development of new reconstruction\nmethods---approximately known Fourier phase. We demonstrate that a rough (up to\n$\\pi/2$ radians) Fourier phase estimate practically guarantees successful\nreconstruction by any reasonable method. We also present a new reconstruction\nmethod whose reconstruction time is orders of magnitude faster than that of the\ncurrent method-of-choice in phase retrieval---Hybrid Input-Output (HIO).\nMoreover, our method is capable of successful reconstruction even in the\nsituations where HIO is known to fail. We also extended our method to other\napplications: Fourier domain holography, and interferometry. Additionally we\ndeveloped a new sparsity-based method for sub-wavelength CDI. Using this method\nwe demonstrated experimental resolution exceeding several times the physical\nlimit imposed by the diffraction light properties (so called diffraction\nlimit).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2012 09:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-22"}
