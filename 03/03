Using three different\ncosmological radiative transfer simulations, we investigate if quasars are\ncapable of substantially changing the size and morphology of the H II regions\nthey are born in. We choose stellar and quasar luminosities in a way that is\nfavourable to seeing such an effect. We find that even the most luminous of our\nquasar models is not able to increase the size of its native H II region\nsubstantially beyond those of large H II regions produced by clustered stellar\nsources alone. However, the quasar H II region is found to be more spherical.\nWe next investigate the prospects of detecting such H II regions in the\nredshifted 21cm data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) by means of a matched\nfilter technique. We find that H II regions with radii ~ 25 comoving Mpc or\nlarger should have a sufficiently high detection probability for 1200 hours of\nintegration time. Although the matched filter can in principle distinguish\nbetween more and less spherical regions, we find that when including realistic\nsystem noise this distinction can no longer be made. The strong foregrounds are\nfound not to pose a problem for the matched filter technique. We also\ndemonstrate that when the quasar position is known, the redshifted 21cm data\ncan still be used to set upper limits on the ionizing photon rate of the\nquasar. If both the quasar position and its luminosity are known, the\nredshifted 21 cm data can set new constrains on quasar lifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 16:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 08:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A scaling behavior is observed as a function of\nincreasing pseudo-rapidity window for the charge fluctuations, expressed in\nterms of \\nchnudyn, where $N_{ch}$ is the number of charged particles. The\nresults are compared to experimental measurements at lower energies and to\nmodel predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 18:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

Combination\nof its properties is puzzling and poses question of its origin. One possible\nscenario is that the cluster formed close to the Galactic Center and later\nmigrated outwards to its current location. In this work we study the cluster's\norbit and investigate the possible migration processes which might have\ndisplaced NGC 6791 to its present-day position, under the assumption that it\nactually formed in the inner disk. To this aim we performed integrations of NGC\n6791's orbit in a potential consistent with the main Milky Way parameters. In\naddition to analytical expressions for halo, bulge and disk, we also consider\nthe effect of bar and spiral arm perturbations, which are expected to be very\nimportant for the disk dynamical evolution, especially inside the solar circle.\nStarting from state-of-the art initial conditions for NGC 6791, we calculate\n1000 orbits back in time for about 1 Gyr turning on and off different\nnon-axisymmetric components of the global potential. We then compare\nstatistical estimates of the cluster's recent orbital parameters with the\norbital parameters of 10^4 test-particles originating close to the Galactic\nCenter (having initial galocentric radii in the range of 3-5 kpc) and\nundergoing radial migration during 8 Gyr of forward integration. We find that a\nmodel which incorporates a strong bar and spiral arm perturbations can indeed\nbe responsible for the migration of NGC 6791 from the inner disk (galocentric\nradii of 3-5 kpc) to its present-day location. Such a model can provide orbital\nparameters which are close enough to the observed ones. However, the\nprobability of this scenario as it results from our investigations is very low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 18:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 08:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}

First, light can serve as a\nquantum nondemolition (QND) probe of the quantum dynamics of various ultracold\nparticles from ultracold atomic and molecular gases to nanoparticles and\nnanomechanical systems.

However, many determinations of temperatures, densities and\nabundances in photoionized nebulae do not quote the associated uncertainty.\nThose that do typically propagate the uncertainties using analytical techniques\nwhich rely on assumptions that generally do not hold.\n  Motivated by this issue, we have developed NEAT (Nebular Empirical Analysis\nTool), a new code for calculating chemical abundances in photoionized nebulae.\nThe code carries out an analysis of lists of emission lines using\nlong-established techniques to estimate the amount of interstellar extinction,\ncalculate representative temperatures and densities, compute ionic abundances\nfrom both collisionally excited lines and recombination lines, and finally to\nestimate total elemental abundances using an ionization correction scheme. NEAT\nuses a Monte Carlo technique to robustly propagate uncertainties from line flux\nmeasurements through to the derived abundances.\n  We show that for typical observational data, this approach is superior to\nanalytic estimates of uncertainties. NEAT also accounts for the effect of\nupward biasing on measurements of lines with low signal to noise, allowing us\nto accurately quantify the effect of this bias on abundance determinations. We\nfind not only that the effect can result in significant over-estimates of heavy\nelement abundances derived from weak lines, but that taking it into account\nreduces the uncertainty of these abundance determinations. Finally, we\ninvestigate the effect of possible uncertainties in R, the ratio of selective\nto total extinction, on abundance determinations. We find that the uncertainty\ndue to this parameter is negligible compared to the statistical uncertainties\ndue to typical line flux measurement uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In the case of BL Lacs the double bumped spectral energy distribution\n(SED) is generally described by the Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC) emission,\nwhile for the FSRQs it is interpreted as due to External Compton (EC) emission.\nRecently, we showed that in the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] micron color- color diagram\nthe blazar population covers a distinct region (i.e., the WISE blazar Strip,\nWBS), clearly separated from the other extragalactic sources that are dominated\nby thermal emission.

These are the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), non-universal\nHiggs masses models (NUHM1, NUHM2), non-universal gaugino masses model (NUGM)\nand GUT related gaugino masses models (NUGMd). Two definitions of the fine\ntuning are used, the first (Delta_{max}) measures maximal fine-tuning wrt\nindividual parameters while the second (Delta_q) adds their contribution in\n\"quadrature\". As a direct result of two theoretical constraints (the EW minimum\nconditions), fine tuning (Delta_q) emerges as a suppressing factor (effective\nprior) of the averaged likelihood (under the priors), under the integral of the\nglobal probability of measuring the data (Bayesian evidence p(D)). For each\nmodel, there is little difference between Delta_q, Delta_{max} in the region\nallowed by the data, with similar behaviour as functions of the Higgs, gluino,\nstop mass or SUSY scale (m_{susy}=(m_{\\tilde t_1} m_{\\tilde t_2})^{1/2}) or\ndark matter and g-2 constraints. The analysis has the advantage that by\nreplacing any of these mass scales or constraints by their latest bounds one\neasily infers for each model the value of Delta_q, Delta_{max} or vice versa.\nFor all models, minimal fine tuning is achieved for M_{higgs} near 115 GeV with\na Delta_q\\approx Delta_{max}\\approx 10 to 100 depending on the model, and in\nthe CMSSM this is actually a global minimum. Due to a strong ($\\approx$\nexponential) dependence of Delta on M_{higgs}, for a Higgs mass near 125 GeV,\nthe above values of Delta_q\\approx Delta_{max} increase to between 500 and\n1000.

We consider this\nproblem in the setting where the underlying distribution is uniform, or more\ngenerally, a product distribution. Kalai, Samorodnitsky and Teng (2009) showed\nthat in this setting a DNF expression can be efficiently approximated from its\n\"heavy\" low-degree Fourier coefficients alone. This is in contrast to previous\napproaches where boosting was used and thus Fourier coefficients of the target\nfunction modified by various distributions were needed. This property is\ncrucial for learning of DNF expressions over smoothed product distributions, a\nlearning model introduced by Kalai et al. (2009) and inspired by the seminal\nsmoothed analysis model of Spielman and Teng (2001).\n  We introduce a new approach to learning (or approximating) a polynomial\nthreshold functions which is based on creating a function with range [-1,1]\nthat approximately agrees with the unknown function on low-degree Fourier\ncoefficients. We then describe conditions under which this is sufficient for\nlearning polynomial threshold functions. Our approach yields a new, simple\nalgorithm for approximating any polynomial-size DNF expression from its \"heavy\"\nlow-degree Fourier coefficients alone. Our algorithm greatly simplifies the\nproof of learnability of DNF expressions over smoothed product distributions.\nWe also describe an application of our algorithm to learning monotone DNF\nexpressions over product distributions.

In\nthis scheme the molecules are initially produced by photoassociation or\nmagnetoassociation in bound vibrational levels close to the first dissociation\nthreshold. We analyze here the first step of the two-color path as a function\nof pulse intensity from the low-field to the high-field regime.

The main consequence of\nthis theorem is that every regular tournament on n vertices can be decomposed\ninto (n-1)/2 edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles, whenever n is sufficiently large.\nThis verified a conjecture of Kelly from 1968. In this paper, we derive a\nnumber of further consequences of our result on robust outexpanders, the main\nones are the following: (i) an undirected analogue of our result on robust\noutexpanders; (ii) best possible bounds on the size of an optimal packing of\nedge-disjoint Hamilton cycles in a graph of minimum degree d for a large range\nof values for d.

Unfortunately all surface-consistent deconvolutions make a\nminimum-phase assumption which is likely to be sub-optimal. Recent developments\nin statistical wavelet estimation demonstrate that nonminimum wavelets can be\nestimated directly from seismic data, thus offering promise to create a\nnonminimum phase surface-consistent deconvolution approach.
