Methods: One-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE) and 1D NLTE barium abundances were derived using classical 1D\nATLAS stellar model atmospheres. The three-dimensional (3D) LTE abundances were\nobtained for 8 red giants on the lower RGB, by adjusting their 1D LTE\nabundances using 3D-1D abundance corrections, i.e., the differences between the\nabundances obtained from the same spectral line using the 3D hydrodynamical\n(CO5BOLD) and classical 1D (LHD) stellar model atmospheres. Results: The mean\n1D barium-to-iron abundance ratios derived for 20 giants are <[Ba/Fe]>_{1D\nNLTE} = 0.05 \\pm0.06 (stat.) \\pm0.08 (sys.). The 3D-1D abundance correction\nobtained for 8 giants is small (~+0.05 dex), thus leads to only minor\nadjustment when applied to the mean 1D NLTE barium-to-iron abundance ratio for\nthe 20 giants, <[Ba/Fe]>_{3D+NLTE} = 0.10 \\pm0.06(stat.) \\pm0.10(sys.). The\nintrinsic abundance spread between the individual cluster stars is small and\ncan be explained in terms of uncertainties in the abundance determinations.\nConclusions: Deviations from LTE play an important role in the formation of\nbarium lines in the atmospheres of red giants studied here. The role of 3D\nhydrodynamical effects should not be dismissed either, even if the obtained\n3D-1D abundance corrections are small. This result is a consequence of subtle\nfine-tuning of individual contributions from horizontal temperature\nfluctuations and differences between the average temperature profiles in the 3D\nand 1D model atmospheres: owing to the comparable size and opposite sign, their\ncontributions nearly cancel each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 16:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 15:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Results: We find that the phase shift of the central\nradial mode (eps_c) is significantly different for red giants at a given large\nfrequency separation (Dnu_c) but which burn only H in a shell (RGB) than those\nthat have already ignited core He burning. Even though not directly probing the\nstellar core the pair of local seismic observables (Dnu_c, eps_c) can be used\nas an evolutionary stage discriminator that turned out to be as reliable as the\nperiod spacing of the mixed dipole modes. We find a tight correlation between\neps_c and Dnu_c for RGB stars and no indication that eps_c depends on other\nproperties of these stars. It appears that the difference in eps_c between the\ntwo populations becomes if we use an average of several radial orders, instead\nof a local, i.e. only around the central radial mode, Dnu to determine the\nphase shift. This indicates that the information on the evolutionary stage is\nencoded locally, in the shape of the radial mode sequence. This shape turns out\nto be approximately symmetric around the central radial mode for RGB stars but\nasymmetric for core He burning stars. We computed radial modes for a sequence\nof RG models and find them to qualitatively confirm our findings. We also find\nthat, at least in our models, the local Dnu is an at least as good and mostly\nbetter proxy for both the asymptotic spacing and the large separation scaled\nfrom the model density than the average Dnu. Finally, we investigate the\nsignature of the evolutionary stage on the small frequency separation and\nquantify the mass dependency of this seismic parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 16:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The main ones are the ocurrence of\naliases and the additional bodies - the planets f and g - announced in Vogt et\nal. 2010. Any dynamical study of exoplanets requires the good knowledge of the\norbital elements and the investigations involving the planet g are particularly\ninteresting, since this body would lie in the Habitable Zone (HZ) of the star\nGJ581. This region,for this system, is very attractive of the dynamical point\nof view due to several resonances of two and three bodies present there. In\nthis work, we investigate the conditions under which the planet g may exist. We\nstress the fact that the planet g is intimately related with the orbital\nelements of the planet d; more precisely, we conclude that it is not possible\nto disconnect its existence from the determination of the eccentricity of the\nplanet d. Concerning the planet f, we have found one solution with period\n$\\approx 450$ days, but we are judicious about any affirmation concernig this\nbody because its signal is in the threshold of detection and the high period is\nin a spectral region where the ocorruence of aliases is very common.

The\nphenomenology of the Higgs sector is at the same time much richer. We\ncritically review the properties of a Higgs with mass around 125GeV in this\nmodel. In particular, we investigate how the rates in the important inclusive 2\nphotons channel, the 2 photons + 2 jets and the ZZ to 4 leptons (and/or WW) can\nbe enhanced or reduced compared to the standard model and what kind of\ncorrelations between these rates are possible.

A distinguishing feature of wireless sensors is the need to perform\nboth source coding tasks, such as measurement and compression, and transmission\ntasks. It is known that the overall energy consumption for source coding is\ngenerally comparable to that of transmission, and that a joint design of the\ntwo classes of tasks can lead to relevant performance gains. Moreover, the\nefficiency of source coding in a sensor network can be potentially improved via\ndistributed techniques by leveraging the fact that signals measured by\ndifferent nodes are correlated.\n  In this paper, a data gathering protocol for multihop wireless sensor\nnetworks with energy harvesting capabilities is studied whereby the sources\nmeasured by the sensors are correlated. Both the energy consumptions of source\ncoding and transmission are modeled, and distributed source coding is assumed.\nThe problem of dynamically and jointly optimizing the source coding and\ntransmission strategies is formulated for time-varying channels and sources.\nThe problem consists in the minimization of a cost function of the distortions\nin the source reconstructions at the sink under queue stability constraints. By\nadopting perturbation-based Lyapunov techniques, a close-to-optimal online\nscheme is proposed that has an explicit and controllable trade-off between\noptimality gap and queue sizes. The role of side information available at the\nsink is also discussed under the assumption that acquiring the side information\nentails an energy cost. It is shown that the presence of side information can\nimprove the network performance both in terms of overall network cost function\nand queue sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 16:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}

The purpose of this article is to describe\ncombinatorial properties of the classical cumulants. We show that like the free\ncumulants, they are obtained by an enumeration of connected matchings, the\nweight being now an evaluation of the Tutte polynomial of a so-called crossing\ngraph. The case q=0 of these cumulants was studied by Lassalle using symmetric\nfunctions and hypergeometric series. We show that the underlying combinatorics\nis explained through the theory of heaps, which is Viennot's geometric\ninterpretation of the Cartier-Foata monoid. This method also gives results for\nthe classical cumulants of the free Poisson law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 17:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

We combine ROSAT, GALEX and 2MASS observations to form the\nSED from 2.2 mic to 2 keV. We find the following: 1. The distribution of the\nH-alpha FWHM values is independent of luminosity. 2. The observed mean\noptical-UV SED is well matched by a fixed shape SED of luminous quasars, which\nscales linearly with L_bHa, and a host galaxy contribution. 3. The host galaxy\nr-band (fibre) luminosity function follows well the luminosity function of\ninactive non-emission line galaxies (NEG), consistent with a fixed fraction of\n~3% of NEG hosting an AGN, regardless of the host luminosity. 4. The hosts of\nlower luminosity AGN have a mean z band luminosity and u-z colour which are\nidentical to NEG with the same redshift distribution. With increasing L_bHa the\nAGN hosts become bluer and less luminous than NEG. The implied increasing star\nformation rate with L_bHa is consistent with the relation for SDSS type 2 AGN\nof similar bolometric luminosity. 5. The optical-UV SED of the more luminous\nAGN shows a small dispersion, consistent with dust reddening of a blue SED, as\nexpected for thermal thin accretion disc emission. 6. There is a rather tight\nrelation of nuL_nu(2 keV) and L_bHa, which provides a useful probe for\nunobscured (true) type 2 AGN. 7. The primary parameter which drives the X-ray\nto UV emission ratio is the luminosity, rather than M_BH or L/L_Edd.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 17:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The first class contains the prototypical models\ndescribed --at the mean-field level-- by the Random First Order Transition\n(RFOT) theory of the glass transition, called either \"random XORSAT problem\"\n(in the information theory community) or \"diluted $p$-spin model\" (in the spin\nglass community), undergoing a single-spin flip Glauber dynamics. The models in\nthe second class are Kinetically Constrained Models (KCM): their Hamiltonian is\nthat of independent spins in a constant magnetic field, hence their\nthermodynamics is completely trivial, but the dynamics is such that only groups\nof spin can flip together, thus implementing a kinetic constraint that induces\na non-trivial dynamical behavior. A mapping between some representatives of\nthese two classes has been known for long. Here we formally prove this mapping\nat the level of the master equation, and we apply it to the particular case of\nBethe lattice models. This allows us to show that a RFOT model can be mapped\nexactly into a KCM. However, the natural order parameter for the RFOT model,\nnamely the spin overlap, is mapped into a very complicated non-local function\nin the KCM. Therefore, if one were to study the KCM without knowing of the\nmapping onto the RFOT model, one would guess that its physics is quite\ndifferent from the RFOT one. Our results instead suggest that these two\napparently different descriptions of the glass transition are, at least in some\ncase, closely related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 18:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 14:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-29"}

A wrong estimate of the\nnumber of target entities can lead to overshooting or undershooting the\ntargets, thus reducing the success probability.

DEEP2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2\ndivided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude of\nR_AB=24.1. Objects with z < 0.7 are rejected based on BRI photometry in three\nof the four DEEP2 fields, allowing galaxies with z > 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5\ntimes more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Approximately\nsixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly\n53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. Most of the\ntargets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z\n~ 1.45. The DEIMOS 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers high\nspectral resolution (R~6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and unique\ninternal kinematic information. Extensive ancillary data are available in the\nDEEP2 fields, particularly in the Extended Groth Strip, which has evolved into\none of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. DEEP2 surpasses other\ndeep precision-redshift surveys at z ~ 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshift\naccuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. We also\nprovide an overview of the scientific highlights of the DEEP2 survey thus far.\nThis paper is intended as a handbook for users of the DEEP2 Data Release 4,\nwhich includes all DEEP2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for the\npublicly-available DEEP2 DEIMOS data reduction pipelines.

As yet, this phenomenon defies full\nunderstanding, but salient aspects of the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior\nobserved beyond the quantum critical point are still accessible within the\ngeneral framework of the Landau quasiparticle picture. Self-consistent\nsolutions of the coupled Landau equations for the quasiparticle momentum\ndistribution $n(p)$ and quasiparticle energy spectrum $\\epsilon(p)$ are shown\nto exist in two distinct classes, depending on coupling strength and on whether\nthe quasiparticle interaction is regular or singular at zero momentum transfer.\nOne class of solutions maintains the idempotency condition $n^2(p)=n(p)$ of\nstandard FL theory at zero temperature $T$ while adding pockets to the Fermi\nsurface. The other solutions are characterized by a swelling of the Fermi\nsurface and a flattening of the spectrum $\\epsilon(p)$ over a range of momenta\nin which the quasiparticle occupancies lie between 0 and 1 even at T=0. The\nlatter, non-idempotent solution is revealed by analysis of a Poincar\\'e mapping\nassociated with the fundamental Landau equation connecting $n(p)$ and\n$\\epsilon(p)$ and validated by solution of a variational condition that yields\nthe symmetry-preserving ground state. Paradoxically, this extraordinary\nsolution carries the burden of a large temperature-dependent excess entropy\ndown to very low temperatures, threatening violation of the Nernst Theorem. It\nis argued that certain low-temperature phase transitions offer effective\nmechanisms for shedding the entropy excess.

If the second conductor\nis part of a closed circuit, a net current will flow in that circuit. The drag\ncurrent is typically much smaller than the drive current owing to the heavy\nscreening of the Coulomb interaction. There are, however, rare situations in\nwhich strong electronic correlations exist between the two conductors. For\nexample, bilayer two-dimensional electron systems can support an exciton\ncondensate consisting of electrons in one layer tightly bound to holes in the\nother. One thus expects \"perfect\" drag; a transport current of electrons driven\nthrough one layer is accompanied by an equal one of holes in the other. (The\nelectrical currents are therefore opposite in sign.) Here we demonstrate just\nthis effect, taking care to ensure that the electron-hole pairs dominate the\ntransport and that tunneling of charge between the layers is negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 20:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

We assume nodes can interact with neighbors, and will add\nlong-range links randomly. The number of long-range links, E, controls\nstructures of these networks, and we show that there exist many types of fixed\npoints, when E is varied. When E is low, fixed points are mostly diverse\nstates, in which node states are diversely populated; on the other hand, when E\nis high, fixed points tend to be dominated by converged states, in which node\nstates converge to one value. Numerically, we observe properties of fixed\npoints for various E's, and also estimate points of the transition from diverse\nstates to converged states for four different cases. This kind of simple\nnetwork models will help us understand how diversities that we encounter in\nmany systems of complex networks are sustained, even when mechanisms of\naveraging are at work,and when they break down if more long-range connections\nare added.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 00:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-16"}

A newly developed three dimensional (3D) mask\nfitting reconstruction method using coronagraph images from three viewpoints\nhas been described and applied to the CME ejected on August 7, 2010. The CME's\n3D localisation, real shape and morphological evolution are presented. Due to\nits interaction with the ambient solar wind, the morphology of this CME changed\nsignificantly in the early phase of evolution. Two hours after its initiation,\nit was expanding almost self-similarly. CME's 3D localisation is quite helpful\nto link remote sensing observations to in situ measurements. The investigated\nCME was propagating to Venus with its flank just touching STEREO B. Its\ncorresponding ICME in the interplanetary space shows a possible signature of a\nmagnetic cloud with a preceding shock in VEX observations, while from STEREO B\nonly a shock is observed. We have calculated three principle axes for the\nreconstructed 3D CME cloud. The orientation of the major axis is in general\nconsistent with the orientation of a filament (polarity inversion line)\nobserved by SDO/AIA and SDO/HMI. The flux rope axis derived by the MVA analysis\nfrom VEX indicates a radial-directed axis orientation. It might be that locally\nonly the leg of the flux rope passed through VEX. The height and speed profiles\nfrom the Sun to Venus are obtained. We find that the CME speed possibly had\nbeen adjusted to the speed of the ambient solar wind flow after leaving COR2\nfield of view and before arriving Venus. A southward deflection of the CME from\nthe source region is found from the trajectory of the CME geometric center. We\nattribute it to the influence of the coronal hole where the fast solar wind\nemanated from.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 03:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

This paper discusses\noriginator usage control, paying particular attention to enterprise-level\ndynamic business federations. Rather than 'pre-defining' the information\nre-dissemination paths, our business process slicing method 'capture' the asset\nderivation pattern, allowing to maintain originators' policies during the full\nlifecycle of assets in a collaborative context. First, we propose Service Call\nGraph (SCG), based on extending the System Dependency Graph, to describe\ndependencies among partners. When SCG (and corresponding 'service call tuple'\nlist) is built for a business process, it is analyzed to group partners into\nsub-contexts, according to their dependency relations. Originator usage control\ncan be achieved focusing on each sub-context, by examining downstream\nconsumers' security profiles with upstream asset providers' policies. Second,\nfor analyzing SCG, we propose two 'slicing' strategies, namely 'asset-based'\nand 'request-based' slicing, to deal with the scenarios of both\n'pre-processing' a business process scripts and 'on-the-fly' analyzing service\ncompositions.

It was\nobserved by Koike-Akino et al. that adaptively changing the network coding map\nused at the relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the\nimpact of multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA\nPhase and all these network coding maps should satisfy a requirement called the\nexclusive law. Only the scenario in which the end nodes use M-PSK signal sets\nis extensively studied in \\cite{NVR} using Latin Sqaures. In this paper, we\naddress the case in which the end nodes use M-QAM signal sets (where M is of\nthe form $2^{2\\lambda}$, $\\lambda$ being any positive integer). In a fading\nscenario, for certain channel conditions $\\gamma e^{j \\theta}$, termed singular\nfade states, the MA phase performance is greatly reduced. We show that the\nsquare QAM signal sets give lesser number of singular fade states compared to\nPSK signal sets. Because of this, the complexity at the relay is enormously\nreduced. Moreover, lesser number of overhead bits are required in the BC phase.\nThe fade state $\\gamma e^{j \\theta}=1$ is singular for all constellations of\narbitrary size including PSK and QAM. For arbitrary PSK constellation it is\nwell known that the Latin Square obtained by bit-wise XOR mapping removes this\nsingularity. We show that XOR mapping fails to remove this singularity for QAM\nof size more greater than 4 and show that a doubly block circulant Latin Square\nremoves this singularity.

Together\nwith traditional mathematical languages using such concepts as 'enumerable\nsets' and 'continuum' a new computational methodology allowing one to measure\nthe number of elements of different infinite sets is used in this paper. It is\nshown how mathematical languages used to describe the machines limit our\npossibilities to observe them. In particular, notions of observable\ndeterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines are introduced and\nconditions ensuring that the latter can be simulated by the former are\nestablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 09:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-16"}

The central star of IC 4663 (PN G346.2-08.2) is\ndominated by broad He II and N V emission lines which correspond to a [WN3]\nspectral type. Unlike previous [WN] candidates, the surrounding nebula is\nunambiguously a PN. At an assumed distance of 3.5 kpc, corresponding to a\nstellar luminosity of 4000 Lsun, the V=16.9 mag central star remains 4-6 mag\nfainter than the average luminosity of massive WN3 stars even out to an\nimprobable d=8 kpc. The nebula is typical of PNe with an elliptical morphology,\na newly discovered Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) halo, a relatively low\nexpansion velocity (v_exp=30 km/s) and a highly ionised spectrum with an\napproximately Solar chemical abundance pattern. The [WN3] star is hot enough to\nshow Ne VII emission (T_*=140+/-20 kK) and exhibits a fast wind (v_infty=1900\nkm/s), which at d=3.5 kpc would yield a clumped mass loss rate of Mdot = 1.8 x\n10^-8 Msun/yr with a small stellar radius (R_*=0.11 Rsun). Its atmosphere\nconsists of helium (95%), hydrogen (<2%), nitrogen (0.8%), neon (0.2%) and\noxygen (0.05%) by mass. Such an unusual helium-dominated composition cannot be\nproduced by any extant scenario used to explain the H-deficiency of post-AGB\nstars. The O(He) central stars share a similar composition and the discovery of\nIC 4663 provides the first evidence for a second He-rich/H-deficient post-AGB\nevolutionary sequence [WN]->O(He). This suggests there is an alternative\nmechanism responsible for producing the majority of H-deficient post-AGB stars\nthat may possibly be expanded to include other He-rich/H-deficient stars such\nas R Coronae Borealis stars and AM Canum Venaticorum stars. The origin of the\nunusual composition of [WN] and O(He) central stars remains unexplained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 10:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In spite of being attractive, Cloud\nfeature poses various new security threats and challenges when it comes to\ndeploying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Cloud environments. Most\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are designed to handle specific types of\nattacks. It is evident that no single technique can guarantee protection\nagainst future attacks. Hence, there is a need for an integrated scheme which\ncan provide robust protection against a complete spectrum of threats. On the\nother hand, there is great need for technology that enables the network and its\nhosts to defend themselves with some level of intelligence in order to\naccurately identify and block malicious traffic and activities.

However, the embedding\napproach, which advantageously converts the hybrid optimal control problem to a\nclassical nonlinear optimization, has not been extensively compared to\nalternative solution approaches. The goal of this paper is thus to compare the\nembedding approach to multi-parametric programming, mixed-integer programming\n(e.g., CPLEX), and gradient-descent based methods in the context of five\nrecently published examples: a spring-mass system, moving-target tracking for a\nmobile robot, two-tank filling, DC-DC boost converter, and skid-steered\nvehicle. A sixth example, an autonomous switched 11-region linear system, is\nused to compare a hybrid minimum principle method and traditional numerical\nprogramming. For a given performance index for each case, cost and solution\ntimes are presented. It is shown that there are numerical advantages of the\nembedding approach: lower performance index cost (except in some instances when\nautonomous switches are present), generally faster solution time, and\nconvergence to a solution when other methods may fail. In addition, the\nembedding method requires no ad hoc assumptions (e.g., predetermined mode\nsequences) or specialized control models. Theoretical advantages of the\nembedding approach over the other methods are also described: guaranteed\nexistence of a solution under mild conditions, convexity of the embedded hybrid\noptimization problem (under the customary conditions on the performance index),\nsolvability with traditional techniques (e.g., sequential quadratic\nprogramming) avoiding the combinatorial complexity in the number of\nmodes/discrete variables of mixed-integer programming, applicability to affine\nnonlinear systems, and no need to explicitly assign discrete/mode variables to\nautonomous switches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 12:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 12:38:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 21:41:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 01:46:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 03:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 00:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2013 01:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-04"}

It is a macro-level\npost-hoc test in contrast to the definition of a Turing Machine (TM), which is\na prior micro-level definition. This raises the question of whether learning is\njust another computational process, i.e. can be implemented as a TM. Here we\nargue that learning or adaption is fundamentally different from computation,\nthough it does involve processes that can be seen as computations. To\nillustrate this difference we compare (a) designing a TM and (b) learning a TM,\ndefining them for the purpose of the argument. We show that there is a\nwell-defined sequence of problems which are not effectively designable but are\nlearnable, in the form of the bounded halting problem. Some characteristics of\nhuman intelligence are reviewed including it's: interactive nature, learning\nabilities, imitative tendencies, linguistic ability and context-dependency. A\nstory that explains some of these is the Social Intelligence Hypothesis. If\nthis is broadly correct, this points to the necessity of a considerable period\nof acculturation (social learning in context) if an artificial intelligence is\nto pass the TT. Whilst it is always possible to 'compile' the results of\nlearning into a TM, this would not be a designed TM and would not be able to\ncontinually adapt (pass future TTs).

To determine the axial couplings, we explicitly match the\nmatrix elements of the axial current in QCD with the corresponding matrix\nelements in HH$\\chi$PT. We construct the ratios of correlation functions used\nto calculate the matrix elements in lattice QCD, and study the contributions\nfrom excited states. We present the complete numerical results and discuss the\ndata analysis in depth. In particular, we demonstrate the convergence of\n$SU(4|2)$ HH$\\chi$PT for the axial-current matrix elements at pion masses up to\nabout 400 MeV and show the impact of the nonanalytic loop contributions.\nFinally, we present additional predictions for strong and radiative decay\nwidths of charm and bottom baryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 14:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 18:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-19"}

These systems may be\nmodeled as state transition systems with transitions representing individual\nreaction events. Since they often involve a large number of interactions, it\ncan be difficult to construct such a model for a system, and since the\nresulting state-level model can involve a huge number of states, model analysis\ncan be difficult or impossible. Here, we describe methods for the high-level\nspecification of a system using hypergraphs, for the automated generation of a\nstate-level model from a high-level model, and for the exact reduction of a\nstate-level model using information from the high-level model. Exact reduction\nis achieved through the automated application of symmetry reduction and\ninvariant manifold reduction techniques to the high-level model, allowing\npotentially significant reductions without the need to generate a full model.\nThe application of the method to biochemical reaction systems is illustrated by\nmodels describing a hypothetical ion-channel at several levels of complexity.\nThe method allows for the reduction of the otherwise intractable example models\nto a manageable size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 15:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

With\nthe Gaussian process prior put on a particular transformation of the latent\nnonlinear functions, instead of the original ones, the algorithm for IGPLVM\ninvolves almost the same computational loads as that for the original GPLVM.\nBesides its potential application in causal discovery, IGPLVM has the advantage\nthat its estimated latent nonlinear manifold is invariant to any nonsingular\nlinear transformation of the data. Experimental results on both synthetic and\nrealworld data show its encouraging performance in nonlinear manifold learning\nand causal discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-19"}

A big challenge in using collaborative filtering\nmethods is the data sparsity problem which often arises because each user\ntypically only rates very few items and hence the rating matrix is extremely\nsparse. In this paper, we address this problem by considering multiple\ncollaborative filtering tasks in different domains simultaneously and\nexploiting the relationships between domains. We refer to it as a multi-domain\ncollaborative filtering (MCF) problem. To solve the MCF problem, we propose a\nprobabilistic framework which uses probabilistic matrix factorization to model\nthe rating problem in each domain and allows the knowledge to be adaptively\ntransferred across different domains by automatically learning the correlation\nbetween domains. We also introduce the link function for different domains to\ncorrect their biases. Experiments conducted on several real-world applications\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods when compared with some\nrepresentative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-19"}
