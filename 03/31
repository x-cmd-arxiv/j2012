The formation rate of the most luminous\nXBs rises with decreasing metallicity, which should increase their significance\nduring galaxy formation in the early universe. We also argue that stochastic\neffects are important to XB feedback (XBF) and may dominate the systematic\nchanges due to metallicity in many cases. Large stochastic variation in the\nmagnitude of XBF at low absolute star formation rates provides a natural reason\nfor diversity in the evolution of dwarf galaxies which were initially almost\nidentical, with several percent of such halos experiencing energy input from\nXBs roughly two orders of magnitude above the most likely value. These\nprobability distributions suggest that the effect of XBF is most commonly\nsignificant for total stellar masses between ~10^7 and 10^8 Msun, which might\nresolve a current problem with modelling populations of such galaxies.

Further,\nother alternative techniques such as the end-to-end universal compression\nsolutions would not perform well either over the Internet traffic, as such\ntechniques require infinite length traffic to effectively remove redundancy.\nThis paper proposes a memory-assisted universal compression technique that\nholds a significant promise for reducing the amount of traffic in the networks.\nThe proposed work is based on the observation that if a source is to be\ncompressed and sent over a network, the associated universal code entails a\nsubstantial overhead in transmission due to finite length traffic. However,\nintermediate nodes can learn the source statistics and this can be used to\nreduce the cost of describing the source statistics, reducing the transmission\noverhead for such traffics.

We study this issue in detail, particularly\nfocusing on the question: \"If future observations reveal nonzero curvature,\nwhat can we conclude?\" We find that whether an observable signal arises or not\ndepends crucially on three issues: the cosmic history just before the\nobservable inflation, the measure adopted to define probabilities, and the\nnature of the correlation between the tunneling and slow-roll parts of the\npotential.

Such models are motivated by problems in chemical kinetics\nwhere one wants to keep the level of a catalyst above a certain threshold in\norder to maintain a desired level of reaction activity. A diffusion limit\ntheorem for the scaled processes is presented, in which the catalyst limit is\ndescribed through a reflected diffusion, while the reactant limit is a\ndiffusion with coefficients that are functions of both the reactant and the\ncatalyst. Stochastic averaging principles under fast catalyst dynamics are\nestablished. In the case where the catalyst evolves \"much faster\" than the\nreactant, a scaling limit, in which the reactant is described through a one\ndimensional SDE with coefficients depending on the invariant distribution of\nthe reflected diffusion, is obtained. Proofs rely on constrained martingale\nproblem characterizations, Lyapunov function constructions, moment estimates\nthat are uniform in time and the scaling parameter and occupation measure\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 18:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2013 11:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

A blend of at least three maser\nfeatures can be inferred from our relatively high spatial resolution data set\n(~ 0.1\"), which is reproduced in a clear non-Gaussian line profile. The\nemission is very stable in polarization fraction and position angle across the\nchannels. The maser spots are aligned with some components of the complex\noutflow configuration of IRAS 16293-2422, and they are excited in zones of\ncompressed gas produced by shocks. The post-shock particle density is in the\nrange of 1-3 x 10^9 cm^-3, consistent with typical water masers pumping\ndensities.

This paper shows that cooperation has fundamental\nlimitations. The main result is that even full cooperation between transmitters\ncannot in general change an interference-limited network to a noise-limited\nnetwork. The key idea is that there exists a spectral efficiency upper bound\nthat is independent of the transmit power. First, a spectral efficiency upper\nbound is established for systems that rely on pilot-assisted channel\nestimation; in this framework, cooperation is shown to be possible only within\nclusters of limited size, which are subject to out-of-cluster interference\nwhose power scales with that of the in-cluster signals. Second, an upper bound\nis also shown to exist when cooperation is through noncoherent communication;\nthus, the spectral efficiency limitation is not a by-product of the reliance on\npilot-assisted channel estimation. Consequently, existing literature that\nroutinely assumes the high-power spectral efficiency scales with the log of the\ntransmit power provides only a partial characterization. The complete\ncharacterization proposed in this paper subdivides the high-power regime into a\ndegrees-of-freedom regime, where the scaling with the log of the transmit power\nholds approximately, and a saturation regime, where the spectral efficiency\nhits a ceiling that is independent of the power. Using a cellular system as an\nexample, it is demonstrated that the spectral efficiency saturates at power\nlevels of operational relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 20:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

Define the minimum period of a\nclass os self-maps of a fixed set as the minimum of the positive integers such\nthat each map in the class has a periodic point whose period is at most this\nnumber.\n  The problem of the determination of the minimum period of the classes of\nhomeomorphisms of closed surfaces was completely solved, in successive steps,\nfrom 1910 to 1996. The aim of our work is, for each compact, connected,\norientable surface, determine the minimum period of its class of\nhomeomorphisms. If the genus of the considered surface is zero or on, then the\nproblem can be solved by simple techniques. For the case of genus at least two,\nwe have found two upper bounds for the minimum periods, which can be expressed\nas a linear function of the genus and the number of boundary components of the\nsurface. We give certain sufficient conditions under which these upper bounds\nare achieved. In particular, we have proved that the minimum period becomes\nconstant for each genus, provided that the number of boundary components is\nlarge enough. We have also studied the minimum periods of the classes of\nfinite-order maps.\n  This thesis has three branches which are interconnected. One has to do with\nthe application of the fixed-point theory. One of the upper bounds of the\nminimum periods is a consequence of this theory. To obtain the other upper\nbound, we have also applied the Thurston-Nielsen classification of\nhomeomorphisms of surfaces and some of its consequences. This is the second\nbranch. Finally, the third branch has to do with the theory of planar\ndiscontinuous group which provide us with the necessary tools for the\nconstruction of examples which prove the existence of lower bounds of the\nminimum periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 21:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

In this\narticle, we examine a range of representation issues for graph-based relational\ndata. Since the choice of relational data representation for the nodes, links,\nand features can dramatically affect the capabilities of SRL algorithms, we\nsurvey approaches and opportunities for relational representation\ntransformation designed to improve the performance of these algorithms. This\nleads us to introduce an intuitive taxonomy for data representation\ntransformations in relational domains that incorporates link transformation and\nnode transformation as symmetric representation tasks. In particular, the\ntransformation tasks for both nodes and links include (i) predicting their\nexistence, (ii) predicting their label or type, (iii) estimating their weight\nor importance, and (iv) systematically constructing their relevant features. We\nmotivate our taxonomy through detailed examples and use it to survey and\ncompare competing approaches for each of these tasks. We also discuss general\nconditions for transforming links, nodes, and features.

This\npaper studies the case of a relay channel, where the source's objective is to\ndeliver a given number of data packets to a receiver with the aid of a relay.\nThe source broadcasts to both the receiver and the relay using one frequency,\nwhile the relay uses another frequency for transmissions to the receiver,\nallowing for a full-duplex operation of the relay. We analyze the decoding\ncomplexity and delay performance of two types of relays: one that preserves the\nsystematic structure of the code from the source; another that does not. A\nsystematic relay forwards uncoded packets upon reception, but transmits coded\npackets to the receiver after receiving the first coded packet from the source.\nOn the other hand, a non-systematic relay always transmits linear combinations\nof previously received packets. We compare the performance of these two\nalternatives by analytically characterizing the expected transmission\ncompletion time as well as the number of uncoded packets forwarded by the\nrelay. Our numerical results show that, for a poor channel between the source\nand the receiver, preserving the systematic structure at the relay (i) allows a\nsignificant increase in the number of uncoded packets received by the receiver,\nthus reducing the decoding complexity, and (ii) preserves close to optimal\ndelay performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 21:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

We\nfirst present the notions of the lower and upper approximation operators based\non fuzzy coverings and derive their basic properties. To facilitate the\ncomputation of fuzzy coverings for fuzzy covering rough sets, the concepts of\nfuzzy subcoverings, the reducible and intersectional elements, the union and\nintersection operations are provided and their properties are discussed in\ndetail. Afterwards, we introduce the concepts of consistent functions and fuzzy\ncovering mappings and provide a basic theoretical foundation for the\ncommunication between fuzzy covering information systems. In addition, the\nnotion of homomorphisms is proposed to reveal the relationship between fuzzy\ncovering information systems. We show how large-scale fuzzy covering\ninformation systems and dynamic fuzzy covering information systems can be\nconverted into small-scale ones by means of homomorphisms. Finally, an\nillustrative example is employed to show that the attribute reduction can be\nsimplified significantly by our proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2012 04:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 01:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

We use\ntwo-dimensional high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to\ninvestigate the effects of magnetic fields on the formation and evolution of\nsuch substructures as well as on the mass inflow rates to the galaxy center.\nThe gaseous medium is assumed to be infinitesimally-thin, isothermal,\nnon-self-gravitating, and threaded by initially uniform, azimuthal magnetic\nfields. We find that there exists an outermost x1-orbit relative to which\ngaseous responses to an imposed stellar bar potential are completely different\nbetween inside and outside. Inside this orbit, gas is shocked into dust lanes\nand infalls to form a nuclear ring. Magnetic fields are compressed in dust\nlanes, reducing their peak density. Magnetic stress removes further angular\nmomentum of the gas at the shocks, temporarily causing the dust lanes to bend\ninto an 'L' shape and eventually leading to a smaller and more centrally\ndistributed ring than in unmagnetized models. The mass inflow rates in\nmagnetized models correspondingly become larger, by more than two orders of\nmagnitude when the initial fields have an equipartition value with thermal\nenergy, than in the unmagnetized counterparts. Outside the outermost x1-orbit,\non the other hand, an MHD dynamo due to the combined action of the bar\npotential and background shear operates near the corotation and bar-end\nregions, efficiently amplifying magnetic fields. The amplified fields shape\ninto trailing magnetic arms with strong fields and low density. The base of the\nmagnetic arms has a thin layer in which magnetic fields with opposite polarity\nreconnect via a tearing-mode instability. This produces numerous magnetic\nislands with large density which propagate along the arms to turn the outer\ndisk into a highly chaotic state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2012 04:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In particular, roles of ties are not\nyet clear to the academic community.\n  Methodology/Principle Findings: Every edges is stamped by its strength that\nis defined solely based on the local topology. According to a weighted\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible model, the steady-state infected density and\nspreading speed are respectively optimized by adjusting the relationship\nbetween edge's strength and spreading ability. Experiments on six real networks\nshow that the infected density is increased when strong ties are favored in the\nspreading, while the speed is enhanced when weak ties are favored. Significance\nof these findings is further demonstrated by comparing with a null model.\n  Conclusions/Significance: Experimental results indicate that strong and weak\nties play distinguishable roles in spreading dynamics: the former enlarge the\ninfected density while the latter fasten the process. The proposed method\nprovides a quantitative way to reveal the qualitatively different roles of\nties, which could find applications in analyzing many networked dynamical\nprocesses with multiple performance indices, such as synchronizability and\nconverging time in synchronization and throughput and delivering time in\ntransportation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2012 13:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

In particularly, the role of conservation\nlaws, the values of hard-core radii along with the effects of the Lorentz\ncontraction of hadron eigen volumes and the hadronic surface tension are\nsystematically studied. It is shown that for the adequate description of hadron\nmultiplicities the conservation laws should be modified, whereas for the\ndescription of hadron yield ratios the conservation laws are not necessary at\nall. Also here we analyzed the usual criteria for the chemical freeze-out and\nfound that none of them is robust. A new chemical freeze-out criterion of\nconstant entropy per hadron equals to 7.18 is suggested and a novel effect of\nadiabatic chemical hadron production is discussed. Additionally, we found that\nthe data for the center of mass energies above 10 GeV lead to the temperature\nof the nil hadronic surface tension coefficient of about $T_0 = 147 \\pm 7$ MeV.\nThis is a very intriguing result since a very close estimate for such a\ntemperature was obtained recently within entirely different approach. We argue\nthat these two independently obtained results evidence that the (tri)critical\ntemperature of the QCD phase diagram is between 140 and 154 MeV. In addition,\nhere we suggest to consider the pion and kaon hard-core radii as new fitting\nparameters. Such an approach for the first time allows us to simultaneously\ndescribe the hadron multiplicities and the Strangeness Horn and get a very high\nquality fit of the available experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2012 14:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-18"}

In our simulation we incorporate this intermediate\nspecies and show that it can explain all other experimental observations: the\ntemperature dependence of the adatom nucleation density, the equilibrium adatom\ndensity and the temperature dependence of the equilibrium island density.

Like the maximum likelihood estimator, the\nreduced-bias estimator is found to respect the invariance properties that make\ncumulative link models a good choice for the analysis of categorical data. Its\nadditional finiteness and optimal frequentist properties, along with the\nadequate behaviour of related asymptotic inferential procedures make the\nreduced-bias estimator attractive as a default choice for practical\napplications.
