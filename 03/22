In the core accretion\nmodel of planet formation this is expected because heavy elements are needed to\nform the dust grains which settle into the midplane of the protoplanetary disk\nand coagulate to form the planetesimals from which planetary cores are\nassembled. As well, there is observational evidence that the lifetimes of\ncircumstellar disks are shorter at lower metallicities, likely due to greater\nsusceptibility to photoevaporation. Here we estimate the minimum metallicity\nfor planet formation, by comparing the timescale for dust grain growth and\nsettling to that for disk photoevaporation. For a wide range of circumstellar\ndisk models and dust grain properties, we find that the critical metallicity\nabove which planets can form is a function of the distance r at which the\nplanet orbits its host star. With the iron abundance relative to that of the\nSun [Fe/H] as a proxy for the metallicity, we estimate a lower limit for the\ncritical abundance for planet formation of [Fe/H]_crit ~ -1.5 + log(r/1 AU),\nwhere an astronomical unit (AU) is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.\nThis prediction is in agreement with the available observational data, and\ncarries implications for the properties of the first planets and for the\nemergence of life in the early Universe. In particular, it implies that the\nfirst Earth-like planets likely formed from circumstellar disks with\nmetallicities Z > 0.1 Z_Sun.

In this survey paper, we present the rigorous functional\nanalytic framework given by the authors in [HerLa1] and within which to study\nthe spectral operator. Furthermore, we also give a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the invertibility of the spectral operator (in the critical\nstrip) and therefore obtain a new spectral and operator-theoretic reformulation\nof the Riemann hypothesis.

Hence, it is not invertible in the\nmid-fractal case when c=1/2, and it is invertible everywhere else (i.e., for\nall c in(0,1) with c not equal to 1/2) if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is\ntrue. We also show the existence of four types of (mathematical) phase\ntransitions occurring for the spectral operator at the critical fractal\ndimension c=1/2 and c=1 concerning the shape of the spectrum, its boundedness,\nits invertibility as well as its quasi-invertibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 20:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 07:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this thesis, I discuss the stability of such\nsystems and explore the consequence of instability on planetary migration. I\nbegin with non-self-gravitating, low viscosity discs and show that giant\nplanets induce shocks inside its co-orbital region, leading to a profile\nunstable to vortex formation around a potential vorticity minimum. This\ninstability is commonly known as the vortex or Rossby wave instability.\nVortex-planet interaction lead to episodic phases of migration, which can be\nunderstood in the framework of type III migration. I then examine the effect of\ndisc self-gravity on gap stability. The linear theory of the Rossby wave\ninstability is extended to include disc gravity, which shows that self-gravity\nis effective at stabilising the vortex instability at small azimuthal\nwavenumber. This is consistent with the observation that more vortices develop\nwith increasing disc mass in hydrodynamic simulations. Vortices in\nself-gravitating discs also resist merging, and is most simply understood as\npair-vortices undergoing mutual horsehoe turns upon encounter. I show that in\nsufficiently massive discs vortex modes are suppressed. Instead, global spiral\ninstabilities develop which are associated with a potential vorticity maximum\nat the gap edge. These edge modes can be physically understood as a result of\nunstable interaction between the gap edge and the exterior disc through\ngravity. I show the spiral arms can provide a positive torque on the planet,\nleading to fast migration outwards. I confirm the above results, obtained from\nrazor-thin disc models, persist in three-dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 20:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-23"}

The main experiment on-board LISA\nPathfinder is the so-called LISA Technology Package (LTP) which has the aim to\nmeasure the differential acceleration between two free-falling test masses with\nan accuracy of 3x10^(-14) ms^(-2)/sqrt[Hz] between 1 mHz and 30 mHz. This\nmeasurement is performed interferometrically by the Optical Metrology System\n(OMS) on-board LISA Pathfinder. In this paper we present the development of an\nexperimental end-to-end testbed of the entire OMS. It includes the\ninterferometer and its sub-units, the interferometer back-end which is a\nphasemeter and the processing of the phasemeter output data. Furthermore,\n3-axes piezo actuated mirrors are used instead of the free-falling test masses\nfor the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of the system and some parts\nof the Drag-free and Attitude Control System (DFACS) which controls the test\nmasses and the satellite. The end-to-end testbed includes all parts of the LTP\nthat can reasonably be tested on earth without free-falling test masses. At its\npresent status it consists mainly of breadboard components. Some of those have\nalready been replaced by Engineering Models of the LTP experiment. In the next\nsteps, further Engineering Models and Flight Models will also be inserted in\nthis testbed and tested against well characterised breadboard components. The\npresented testbed is an important reference for the unit tests and can also be\nused for validation of the on-board experiment during the mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 21:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-23"}

Due to the non-linearity of this\nfunctional, it usually has many solutions called Gribov copies. The dependence\nof the number of Gribov copies, n[U] on the different gauge orbits plays an\nimportant role in constructing the Faddeev-Popov procedure and hence in\nrealising the BRST symmetry on the lattice. Here, we initiate a study of\ncounting n[U] for different orbits using three complimentary methods: 1.\nanalytical results in lower dimensions, and some lower bounds on n[U] in higher\ndimensions, 2. the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, which\nnumerically finds all Gribov copies for a given orbit for small lattices, and\n3. numerical minimisation (\"brute force\"), which finds many distinct Gribov\ncopies, but not necessarily all. Because n for the coset SU(N_c)/U(1) of an\nSU(N_c) theory is orbit-independent, we concentrate on the residual compact\nU(1) case in this article and establish that n is orbit-dependent for the\nminimal lattice Landau gauge and orbit-independent for the absolute lattice\nLandau gauge.

Rather than solving this non-concave maximization\nproblem, we derive upper and lower bounds for the optimal rate. A cut-set like\nupper bound is obtained in a closed form for a layered relay network. A\npseudo-optimal AF scheme is developed for a two-hop parallel network, which is\ndifferent from the conventional scheme with all amplification gains chosen as\nthe maximum possible values. The conditions under which either the novel scheme\nor the conventional one achieves a rate within half a bit of the upper bound\nare found. Then we provide an AF-based multi-hop ANC scheme with the two\nschemes for a layered relay network.

While most previous approaches\nhave focused on completely encrypting the video stream, we introduce a spatial\nencryption scheme by blurring the image/video contents to create a CBP. Our\ngoal is to obscure detail in public video streams by blurring while allowing\nbehavior to be recognized and to quickly deblur the stream so that details are\navailable if behavior is recognized as suspicious. We create a CBP by blurring\nthe same latent image with two unknown kernels. The two kernels are coprime\nwhen mapped to bivariate polynomials in the z domain. To deblur the CBP we\nfirst use the coprime constraint to approximate the kernels and sample the\nbivariate CBP polynomials in one dimension on the unit circle. At each sample\npoint, we factor the 1D polynomial pair and compose the results into a 2D\nkernel matrix. Finally, we compute the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of\nthe kernel matrices to recover the coprime kernels and then the latent video\nstream. It is therefore only possible to deblur the video stream if a user has\naccess to both streams. To improve the practicability of our algorithm, we\nimplement our algorithm using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to decrypt the\nblurred video streams in real-time, and extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our new scheme can effectively protect sensitive identity\ninformation in surveillance videos and faithfully reconstruct the unblurred\nvideo stream when two blurred sequences are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 02:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-23"}

Although it is a Grassmann function, the distribution\nfunction is equivalent to six c-number functions of the two bosonic variables.\nExperimental quantities are given as bosonic phase space integrals involving\nthe six functions. A Fokker-Planck equation involving both left and right\nGrassmann differentiation can be obtained for the distribution function, and is\nequivalent to six coupled equations for the six c-number functions.\n  The approach used involves choosing the canonical form of the (non-unique)\npositive P distribution function, where the correspondence rules for bosonic\noperators are non-standard and hence the Fokker-Planck equation is also\nunusual. Initial conditions, such as for initially uncorrelated states, are\nused to determine the initial distribution function. Transformations to new\nbosonic variables rotating at the cavity frequency enables the six coupled\nequations for the new c-number functions (also equivalent to the canonical\nGrassmann distribution function) to be solved analytically, based on an ansatz\nfrom a 1980 paper by Stenholm.

The spin-orbit scattering behaves like random magnetic fields only to\nthe triplet Cooperon, and suppresses the weak localization of Dirac fermions in\nthe large-mass regime. This behavior suggests an experiment to detect the weak\nlocalization of bulk subbands in topological insulator thin films, in which a\nnarrowing of the cusp of the negative magnetoconductivity is expected after\ndoping heavy-element impurities. Finally, a detailed comparison between the\nconventional two-dimensional electrons and Dirac fermions is presented for\nimpurities of orthogonal, symplectic, and unitary symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 04:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-07"}

We prove that it is not possible for the\nprover to improve on the optimum average value per repetition by repeating the\nprotocol multiple times in parallel.\n  We look then at games in which the outcomes are classified into two types,\nwinning outcomes and losing outcomes. We ask what is the optimal probability\nfor the prover of winning at least k times out of n parallel repetitions, given\nthat the optimal probability of winning when only one repetition is considered\nis $p$.

Through\nsimultaneous observations of all the 3 lines of a Cr I triplet, combined with\nrealistic radiative transfer modeling of the data, we show that it is necessary\nto include J-state interference consistently when modeling lines with partially\ninteracting fine structure components. Polarized line formation theory that\nincludes J-state interference effects together with partial frequency\nredistribution for a two-term atom is used to model the observations.\nCollisional frequency redistribution is also accounted for.

Theoretical studies of such landscapes have been carried out for\nseveral decades, but only recently experimental fitness measurements\nencompassing all possible combinations of small sets of mutations have become\navailable. The empirical studies have spawned new questions about the\naccessibility of optimal genotypes under natural selection. Depending on\npopulation dynamic parameters such as mutation rate and population size,\nevolutionary accessibility can be quantified through the statistics of\naccessible mutational pathways (along which fitness increases monotoncially),\nor through the study of the basin of attraction of the optimal genotype under\ngreedy (steepest ascent) dynamics. Here we investigate these two measures of\naccessibility in the framework of Kauffman's $LK$-model, a paradigmatic family\nof random fitness landscapes with tunable ruggedness. The key parameter\ngoverning the strength of genetic interactions is the number $K$ of interaction\npartners of each of the $L$ sites in the genotype sequence. In general,\naccessibility increases with increasing genotype dimensionality $L$ and\ndecreases with increasing number of interactions $K$. Remarkably, however, we\nfind that some measures of accessibility behave non-monotonically as a function\nof $K$, indicating a special role of the most sparsely connected, non-trivial\ncases K=1 and 2. The relation between models for fitness landscapes and spin\nglasses is also addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 10:17:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 16:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

At each timestep, a pair of diploid\nindividuals drawn uniformly at random contribute offspring to the population.\nThe number of offspring can be large relative to the total population size.\nSimilar `heavily skewed' reproduction mechanisms have been considered by\nvarious authors recently. Each diploid parental individual contributes exactly\none chromosome to each diploid offspring, and hence ancestral lineages can only\ncoalesce when in distinct individuals. A separation of timescales phenomenon is\nthus observed. A result of M\\\"{o}hle (1998) is extended to obtain convergence\nof the ancestral process to an ancestral recombination graph necessarily\nadmitting simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lineages. The usual\nancestral recombination graph is obtained as a special case of our model when\nthe parents contribute only one offspring to the population each time. Due to\ndiploidy and large offspring numbers, novel effects appear. For example, the\nmarginal genealogy at each locus admits simultaneous multiple mergers in up to\nfour groups, and different loci remain substantially correlated even as the\nrecombination rate grows large. Thus, genealogies for loci far apart on the\nsame chromosome remain correlated. Correlation in coalescence times for two\nloci is derived and shown to be a function of the coalescence parameters of our\nmodel. Extending the observations by Eldon and Wakeley (2008), predictions of\nlinkage disequilibrium are shown to be functions of the reproduction parameters\nof our model, in addition to the recombination rate.

In this\nmethod the coefficients at $k$ are determined by summing the contributions made\nby each partition whose elements sum to $k$. These contributions are found by\nassigning values to each element and multiplying by an appropriate multinomial\nfactor. This work presents a theoretical framework for the partition method for\na power series expansion. To overcome the complexity due to the contributions,\na programming methodology is created allowing more general problems to be\nstudied than envisaged originally. The methodology uses the bi-variate\nrecursive central partition (BRCP) algorithm, which is based on a tree-diagram\napproach to scanning partitions. Its main advantage is that partitions are\ngenerated in the multiplicity representation. During the development of the\ntheoretical framework, scanning over partitions was seen as a discrete\noperation with an operator $L_{P,k}[ \\cdot]$, whose summand depends on the\ncoefficients of the two series when the original function is written as a\npseudo-composite function. Simple modifications result in programs for other\noperators of specific types of partitions such as: (1) only odd or even\nelements, (2) a fixed number of elements, (3) discrete elements, (4) specific\nelements and (5) those restricted by element size. Another modification\ngenerates conjugate partitions by transposing Ferrers diagrams. The operator\napproach is then applied to the generating functions for both discrete and\nstandard partitions. The main generalisation introduces a parameter $\\omega$,\nwhose powers give the number of elements in the partitions while the\ncoefficients become polynomials in $\\omega$. Finally, power series expansions\nfor more advanced infinite products are derived, culminating in Heine's\nmulti-parameter product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 11:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-23"}

In this\npaper we probe the mechanism regulating the warm gas-phase water abundance in\nthe innermost hundred AU of deeply embedded (Class~0) low-mass protostars, and\ninvestigate its chemical relationship to other molecular species during these\nstages. Millimeter wavelength thermal emission from the para-H2-18O\n3(1,3)-2(2,0) (Eu=203.7 K) line is imaged at high angular resolution (0.75\";\n190 AU) with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer towards the deeply\nembedded low-mass protostars NGC 1333-IRAS2A and NGC 1333-IRAS4A. Compact\nH2-18O emission is detected towards IRAS2A and one of the components in the\nIRAS4A binary; in addition CH3OCH3, C2H5CN, and SO2 are detected. Extended\nwater emission is seen towards IRAS2A, possibly associated with the outflow.\nThe detections in all systems suggests that the presence of water on <100 AU\nscales is a common phenomenon in embedded protostars. We present a scenario in\nwhich the origin of the emission from warm water is in a flattened disk-like\nstructure dominated by inward motions rather than rotation. The gas-phase water\nabundance varies between the sources, but is generally much lower than a\ncanonical abundance of 10^-4, suggesting that most water (>96 %) is frozen out\non dust grains at these scales. The derived abundances of CH3OCH3 and SO2\nrelative to H2-18O are comparable for all sources pointing towards similar\nchemical processes at work. In contrast, the C2H5CN abundance relative to\nH2-18O is significantly lower in IRAS2A, which could be due to different\nchemistry in the sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 12:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In both images, at 350 and 870 micron,\nemission is detected from SN1987A, and the source is unresolved. The flux\ndensities in the new (2011) measurements are consistent with those measured\nbefore with Herschel at 350 micron (in 2010) and with APEX at 870 micron (in\n2007). A higher dust temperature (approximately 33 K) and lower dust mass might\nbe possible than what was previously thought. The new measurements, at the\nhighest angular resolution achieved so far at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths,\nstrengthen the constraints on the location of the emission, which is thought to\nbe close to the site of SN1987A and its circumstellar ring structures. These\nmeasurements set the stage for upcoming observations at even higher angular\nresolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 12:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this work, we explore the\nrole of super-AGB ejecta using yields recently calculated by Ventura and\nD'Antona. Models of clusters showing extended Na-O anticorrelations, like NGC\n2808, indicate that a SG formation history similar to that outlined in our\nprevious work is required: formation of an Extreme population with very large\nhelium content from the pure ejecta of super-AGB stars, followed by formation\nof an Intermediate population by dilution of stellar ejecta with pristine gas.\nThe very O-poor Na-rich Extreme stars can be accounted for once deep-mixing is\nassumed in SG giants forming in a gas with helium abundance Y> 0.34, which\nsignificantly reduces the atmospheric oxygen content, while preserving the\nsodium abundance. On the other hand, for clusters showing a mild O-Na\nanticorrelation, like M 4, the use of the new yields broadens the range of SG\nformation routes leading to abundance patterns consistent with observations. It\nis shown that models in which SG stars form only from super-AGB ejecta promptly\ndiluted with pristine gas can reproduce the observations.

We first recall that this is indeed the case in\nboth relativity and quantum mechanics, although in very different manners: time\nflows geometrically in relativity (i.e. as a flow of proper time in the four\ndimensional space-time), time flows abstractly in quantum mechanics (i.e. as a\nflow in the space of observables of the system). We then ask the same question\nin quantum gravity, in the light of the thermal time hypothesis of Connes and\nRovelli. The latter proposes to answer the question of time in quantum gravity\n(or at least one of its many aspects), by postulating that time is a state\ndependent notion. This means that one is able to make a notion of\ntime-as-an-abstract-flow - that we call the thermal time - emerge from the\nknowledge of both: 1) the algebra of observables of the physical system under\ninvestigation, 2) a state of thermal equilibrium of this system. Formally, this\nthermal time is similar to the abstract flow of time in quantum mechanics, but\nwe show in various examples that it may have a concrete implementation either\nas a geometrical flow, or as a geometrical flow combined with a non-geometric\naction. This indicates that in quantum gravity, time may well still be\n\"something that flows\" at some abstract algebraic level, but this does not\nnecessarily imply that time is always and only \"something that flows\" at the\ngeometric level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 14:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-10"}

The HII region/PDR/molecular cloud complex S106 is excited by a\nsingle O-star. The full extent of the warm and dense gas close to the star has\nnot been mapped in spectrally resolved high-J CO or [CII] lines, so the\nkinematics of the warm, partially ionized gas, are unknown.

To disentangle\nthe morphology and kinematics of warm neutral and ionized gas close to the\nstar, study their relation to the bulk of the molecular gas, and to investigate\nthe nature of the dark lane. Methods. We use the heterodyne receiver GREAT on\nboard SOFIA to observe velocity resolved spectral lines of [C II] and CO 11-10\nin comparison with so far unpublished submm continuum data at 350 micron\n(SHARC-II) and complementary molecular line data. Results. The high angular and\nspectral resolution observations show a very complex morphology and kinematics\nof the inner S106 region, with many different components at different\nexcitation conditions contributing to the observed emission. The [C II] lines\nare found to be bright and very broad, tracing high velocity gas close to the\ninterface of molecular cloud and HII region. CO 11-10 emission is more\nconfined, both spatially and in velocity, to the immediate surroundings of S106\nIR showing the presence of warm, high density (clumpy) gas.
