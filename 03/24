A member of the Upper Centaurus Lupus\nassociation, it is a star with a well-determined age of 16 Myr. Twelve new\nspectra obtained from the FEROS, ESPaDOnS, and HARPS instruments, provide\nsufficient material from which to re-evaluate the magnetic field and obtain a\nfirst approximation to the atmospheric abundance distributions of various\nelements. Using the new magnetic field measurements and optical photometry\ntogether with previously published data, we refine the period of HD 133880 to P\n= 0.877476 \\pm 0.000009 days. The magnetic field structure was characterised by\na colinear multipole expansion from the observed variations of the longitudinal\nand surface fields with rotational phase. This simple axisymmetric magnetic\nfield model is based on a predominantly quadrupolar component that roughly\ndescribes the field variations. Using spectrum synthesis, we derived mean\nabundances for O, Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Nd and Pr. All elements, except Mg (which\nhas a uniform distribution), are overabundant compared to the Sun and are more\nabundant in the negative than in the positive magnetic hemisphere. In contrast\nto most Bp stars the abundance of O in HD 133880 is overabundant compared to\nthe solar abundance ratio. In studying the Halpha and Paschen lines in the\noptical spectra we could not unambiguously detect information about the\nmagnetosphere of HD 133880. However, radio emission data at both 3 and 6 cm\nsuggests that the magnetospheric plasma is held in rigid rotation with the star\nby the magnetic field and further supported against collapse by the rapid\nrotation. Subtle differences in the shapes of the optically thick radio light\ncurves at 3 and 6 cm suggest that the large-scale magnetic field is not fully\naxisymmetric at large distances from the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 16:03:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 15:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Thus the difference of the EMC ratio\nfrom one reveals the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei.\nUsing exact QCD sum rules we show that the ratio R_A(x_p,Q^2) used in\nexperimental studies, where x_p = Q^2/2q_0 m_p deviates from one even if a\nnucleus consists of nucleons with small momenta only.

The sample covers 3,600 square degrees, corresponding\nto a comoving volume of 9.7(Gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology,\nand it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2.

The stellar surface density maps of the sample galaxies were derived\nfrom the archival data of SINGS and SDSS. The corresponding molecular and\natomic surface densities were derived from archival CO(1-0) and HI\ninterferometric observations of the BIMA SONG, THINGS, and VIVA surveys. The\nmethod used for determining the radial mass flow rates follows from our\nprevious work using the potential-density phase shift approach, which utilizes\na volume-type torque integral to calculate the angular momentum exchange rate\nbetween the basic state disk matter and the density wave modes. This approach\nyields radial mass flow rates and angular momentum transport rates several\ntimes higher than similar rates estimated using the traditional method of\ngravitational torque couple of Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972, and this\ndifference reflects the dominant role played by collisionless shocks in the\nsecular evolution of galaxies containing extremely non-linear, quasi-steady\ndensity wave modes. It is shown that these non-linear modes maintains their\nquasi-steady state at the expense of a continuous radial mass flow and the\nresulting morphological transformation of galaxies throughout their lifetime,\nnot only for late-type and intermediate-type disk galaxies but, under favorable\nconditions, also for earlier types including S0s and disky ellipticals.

To this\nend, the X-ray point source lists from detections in the soft-band (0.35-2.4\nkeV) and full-band (0.3-7.5 keV) were stacked in cluster-centric coordinates\nand compared to average background number counts extracted from three\nindependent control fields in the same observations. A significant full-band\n(soft-band) excess of \\sim78 (67) X-ray point sources is found in the cluster\nfields within an angular distance of 8' (4Mpc) at a statistical confidence\nlevel of 4.0 sigma (4.2 sigma), corresponding to an average number of detected\nexcess AGN per cluster environment of 3.5\\pm0.9 (3.0\\pm0.7). The data point\ntowards a rising radial profile in the cluster region (r<1Mpc) of predominantly\nlow-luminosity AGN with an average detected excess of about one point source\nper system, with a tentative preferred occurrence along the main cluster\nelongation axis. A second statistically significant overdensity of brighter\nsoft-band detected AGN is found at cluster-centric distances of 4'-6' (2-3Mpc),\ncorresponding to about three times the average cluster radius R200 of the\nsystems. If confirmed, these results would support the idea of two different\nphysical triggering mechanisms of X-ray AGN activity in dependence of the\nradially changing large-scale structure environment of the distant clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

The reconnection process is made\nasymmetric along the inflow direction by allowing the initial upstream magnetic\nfield strengths and densities to differ, and along the outflow direction by\nplacing the initial perturbation near a conducting wall boundary that\nrepresents the photosphere. When the upstream magnetic fields are asymmetric,\nthe post-flare loop structure is distorted into a characteristic skewed candle\nflame shape. The simulations can thus be used to provide constraints on the\nreconnection asymmetry in post-flare loops. More hard X-ray emission is\nexpected to occur at the footpoint on the weak magnetic field side because\nenergetic particles are more likely to escape the magnetic mirror there than at\nthe strong magnetic field footpoint. The footpoint on the weak magnetic field\nside is predicted to move more quickly because of the requirement in two\ndimensions that equal amounts of flux must be reconnected from each upstream\nregion. The X-line drifts away from the conducting wall in all simulations with\nasymmetric outflow and into the strong magnetic field region during most of the\nsimulations with asymmetric inflow. There is net plasma flow across the X-line\nfor both the inflow and outflow directions. The reconnection exhaust directed\naway from the obstructing wall is significantly faster than the exhaust\ndirected towards it. The asymmetric inflow condition allows net vorticity in\nthe rising outflow plasmoid which would appear as rolling motions about the\nflux rope axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 21:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 21:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Then the resulting electric field\nunder the tip apex is inserted into a series of atomistic wavelet-based density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations.

Theoretical expressions for amplitude modulation\n(AM) and frequency modulation (FM) KPFM signals and for the corresponding local\ncontact potential differences (LCPD) are obtained by combining the macroscopic\nand atomistic contributions to the electrostatic force component generated at\nthe voltage modulation frequency, and evaluated for several tip oscillation\namplitudes A up to 10 nm. Being essentially constant over a few Volts, the\nslope of atomistic force versus bias is the basic quantity which determines\nvariations of the atomic-scale LCPD contrast. Already above A = 0.1 nm, the\nLCPD contrasts in both modes exhibit almost the same spatial dependence as the\nslope. In the AM mode, this contrast is approximately proportional to\n$A^{-1/2}$, but remains much weaker than the contrast in the FM mode, which\ndrops somewhat faster as A is increased. These trends are a consequence of the\nmacroscopic contributions to the KPFM signal, which are stronger in the AM-mode\nand especially important if the sample is an insulator even at sub-nanometer\nseparations where atomic-scale contrast appears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 10:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-19"}

They are associated with coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) and solar flares, but we still do not clearly understand the\nspecial conditions that produce these rare events. During Solar Cycle 23, a\ntotal of 16 GLEs were registered, using ground-based neutron monitor data. We\nfirst ask if these GLEs are clearly distinguishable from other SEP events\nobserved from space. Setting aside possible difficulties in identifying all\nGLEs consistently, we then try to find observables which may unmistakably\nisolate these GLEs by studying the basic properties of the associated eruptions\nand the active regions (ARs) that produced them. It is found that neither the\nmagnitudes of the CMEs and flares nor the complexities of the ARs give\nsufficient conditions for GLEs. It is possible to find CMEs, flares or ARs that\nare not associated with GLEs but that have more extreme properties than those\nassociated with GLEs. We also try to evaluate the importance of magnetic field\nconnection of the AR with Earth on the detection of GLEs and their onset times.\nUsing the potential field source surface (PFSS) model, a half of the GLEs are\nfound to be well-connected. However, the GLE onset time with respect to the\nonset of the associated flare and CME does not strongly depend on how\nwell-connected the AR is. The GLE onset behavior may be largely determined by\nwhen and where the CME-driven shock develops. We could not relate the shocks\nresponsible for the onsets of past GLEs with features in solar images, but the\ncombined data from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) and the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) have the potential to change this for GLEs\nthat may occur in the rising phase of Solar Cycle 24.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Filters refer to a class of data\nassimilation algorithms designed to update the estimation of the state as data\nis acquired sequentially. For linear problems subject to Gaussian noise\nfiltering can be performed exactly using the Kalman filter. For nonlinear\nsystems it can be approximated in a systematic way by particle filters. However\nin high dimensions these particle filtering methods can break down. Hence, for\nthe large nonlinear systems arising in applications such as oceanography and\nweather forecasting, various ad hoc filters are used, based on Gaussian\napproximations. In this work, we study the accuracy and stability of these ad\nhoc filters in the context of the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The\nideas readily generalize to a range of dissipative partial differential\nequations (PDEs). By working in this infinite dimensional setting we provide an\nanalysis which is useful for the understanding of high dimensional filtering,\nand is robust to mesh-refinement. We describe theoretical results showing that,\nin the small observational noise limit, the filters can be tuned to perform\naccurately in tracking the signal itself (filter accuracy), provided the system\nis observed in a sufficiently large low dimensional space; roughly speaking\nthis space should be large enough to contain the unstable modes of the\nlinearized dynamics. The tuning corresponds to what is known as variance\ninflation in the applied literature. Numerical results are given which\nillustrate the theory. The positive results herein concerning filter stability\ncomplement recent numerical studies which demonstrate that the ad hoc filters\ncan perform poorly in reproducing statistical variation about the true signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Mar 2012 10:51:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 11:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 05:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

Fluid mechanical considerations falsify both the\naccelerating expansion and dark energy concepts. Kinematic viscosity is\nneglected in current standard models of self-gravitational structure formation,\nwhich rely on cold dark matter CDM condensations and clusterings that are also\nfalsified by fluid mechanics. Weakly collisional CDM particles do not condense\nbut diffuse away. Photon viscosity predicts superclustervoid fragmentation\nearly in the plasma epoch and protogalaxies at the end. At the plasma-gas\ntransition, the plasma fragments into Earth-mass gas planets in trillion planet\nclumps (proto-globular-star-cluster PGCs). The hydrogen planets freeze to form\nthe dark matter of galaxies and merge to form their stars. Dark energy is a\nsystematic dimming error for Supernovae Ia caused by dark matter planets near\nhot white dwarf stars at the Chandrasekhar carbon limit. Evaporated planet\natmospheres may or may not scatter light from the events depending on the line\nof sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 21:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-04"}
