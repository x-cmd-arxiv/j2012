The study presented is based on data obtained with\nSpitzer IRAC and MIPS, combined with deep NIR ground-based FLAMINGOS imaging\nand previously published optical data. We build NIR dust extinction maps of the\nmolecular cloud associated with the cluster, and determine it to have a mass of\n2.1x10^3Msun above an Av of 7mag. Using a differential K_s-band luminosity\nfunction of the cluster, we estimate the size of its population to be\n1436$\\pm$242 members. The star formation efficiency is ~25%. We identify the\ndisk population: (i) optically thick inner disks, (ii) anaemic inner disks, and\n(iii) disks with inner holes, or transition disks. We analyse the spatial\ndistribution of these sources and find that sources with thick disks segregate\ninto sub-clusterings, whereas sources with anaemic disks do not. Furthermore,\nsources with anaemic disks are found to be unembedded (Av<3mag), whereas the\nclustered sources with thick disks are still embedded within the parental\ncloud. NGC2264 has undergone more than one star-forming event, where the\nanaemic and extincted thick disk population appear to have formed in separate\nepisodes. We also find tentative evidence of triggered star-formation in the\nFox Fur Nebula. In terms of disk evolution, our findings support the emerging\ndisk evolution paradigm of two distinct evolutionary paths for primordial\noptically thick disks: a homologous one where the disk emission decreases\nuniformly at NIR and MIR wavelengths, and a radially differential one where the\nemission from the inner region of the disk decreases more rapidly than from the\nouter region (forming transition disks).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 16:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

One approach that has\nbeen shown successful in stabilizing MHD calculations are constrained transport\n(CT) schemes. CT schemes can be viewed as predictor-corrector methods for\nupdating the magnetic field, where a magnetic field value is first predicted by\na method that does not exactly preserve the divergence-free condition on the\nmagnetic field, followed by a correction step that aims to control these\ndivergence errors. In Helzel et al. (2011) the authors presented an unstaggered\nconstrained transport method for the MHD equations on 3D Cartesian grids. In\nthis work we generalize the method of Helzel et al. (2011) in three important\nways: (1) we remove the need for operator splitting by switching to an\nappropriate method of lines discretization and coupling this with a\nnon-conservative finite volume method for the magnetic vector potential\nequation, (2) we increase the spatial and temporal order of accuracy of the\nentire method to third order, and (3) we develop the method so that it is\napplicable on both Cartesian and logically rectangular mapped grids. The\nevolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is solved using a\nnon-conservative finite volume method. The curl of the magnetic potential is\ncomputed via a third-order accurate discrete operator that is derived from\nappropriate application of the divergence theorem and subsequent numerical\nquadrature on element faces. Special artificial resistivity limiters are used\nto control unphysical oscillations in the magnetic potential and field\ncomponents across shocks.

Here w and f denote the weight of granule and the\nfractional (w/w) assay of API in it. This ratio should be as small as possible\nto obtain best CU. We also derive analytical expressions which show how the\ngranule loading impacts the CU through the excluded volume, which has been\nlargely ignored in the literature to date. The model was tested against\nliterature data and a large set of tablet formulations specifically made and\nanalyzed for CU using a model API.

Hence, methods\nto characterize and predict the structure of the network connecting countries\nto the products that they export are relevant for understanding the dynamics of\neconomic development. Here we study the presence and absence of industries at\nthe global and national levels and show that these networks are significantly\nnested. This means that the less filled rows and columns of these networks'\nadjacency matrices tend to be subsets of the fuller rows and columns. Moreover,\nwe show that nestedness remains relatively stable as the matrices become more\nfilled over time and that this occurs because of a bias for industries that\ndeviate from the networks' nestedness to disappear, and a bias for the missing\nindustries that reduce nestedness to appear. This makes the appearance and\ndisappearance of individual industries in each location predictable. We\ninterpret the high level of nestedness observed in these networks in the\ncontext of the neutral model of development introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann\n(2009). We show that, for the observed fills, the model can reproduce the high\nlevel of nestedness observed in these networks only when we assume a high level\nof heterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities available in countries and\nrequired by products. In the context of the neutral model, this implies that\nthe high level of nestedness observed in these economic networks emerges as a\ncombination of both, the complementarity of inputs and heterogeneity in the\nnumber of capabilities available in countries and required by products. The\nstability of nestedness in industrial ecosystems, and the predictability\nimplied by it, demonstrates the importance of the study of network properties\nin the evolution of economic networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 19:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 18:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Perturbations that exceeded some critical threshold are\nconjectured to have undergone gravitational collapse to form primordial black\nholes (PBHs) at a range of masses. Such PBHs serve as candidates for cold dark\nmatter and their detection would shed light on conditions in the early\nuniverse. Here we propose a mechanism to search for transits of PBHs\nthrough/nearby Earth by studying the associated seismic waves. Using a\nspectral-element method, we simulate and visualize this seismic wave field in\nEarth's interior. We predict the emergence of two unique signatures, namely, a\nwave that would arrive almost simultaneously everywhere on Earth's free surface\nand the excitation of unusual spheroidal modes with a characteristic\nfrequency-spacing in free oscillation spectra. These qualitative\ncharacteristics are unaffected by the speed or proximity of the PBH trajectory.\nThe seismic energy deposited by a proximal ${M^{PBH} = 10^{15}}$ g PBH is\ncomparable to a magnitude $M_w=4$ earthquake. The non-seismic collateral damage\ndue to the actual impact of such small PBHs with Earth would be negligible.\nUnfortunately, the expected collision rate is very low even if PBHs constituted\nall of dark matter, at ${\\sim 10^{-7} {yr}^{-1}}$, and since the rate scales as\n${1/M^{PBH}}$, fortunately encounters with larger, Earth-threatening PBHs are\nexceedingly unlikely. However, the rate at which non-colliding close encounters\nof PBHs could be detected by seismic activity alone is roughly two orders of\nmagnitude larger --- that is once every hundred thousand years --- than the\ndirect collision rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2012 20:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

An atlas is a\nlabeled partition of the assembly landscape into a topological roadmap of\nmaximal, contiguous, nearly-equipotential-energy conformational regions or\nmacrostates, together with their neighborhood relationships. The new\nmethodology decouples the roadmap generation from sampling and produces: (1) a\nquery-able atlas of local potential energy minima, their basin structure,\nenergy barriers, and neighboring basins; (2) paths between a specified pair of\nbasins; and (3) approximations of relative path lengths, basin volumes\n(configurational entropy), and path probabilities.

This year we also have a clear\ndemonstration that dependence of form factors on the spectator quark mass\nbetween light and strange is very small. Apart from the phenomenology\nimplications, this has practical application to the normalisation of branching\nfractions in experiment. The current best Standard model rate for a key LHC\nmode sensitive to new physics - $B_{(s)} \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ - is derived\nfrom lattice QCD calculations on $B/B_s$ mixing rates. I will discuss the\ncurrent result and prospects for improving lattice QCD errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Mar 2012 14:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-20"}
