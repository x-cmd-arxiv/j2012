We\nfind that the excitation properties of nebulae in the outer (R>R25) disks are\nsimilar to those of the inner disks, but on average younger HII regions tend to\nbe selected in the bright inner disks. Reddening by dust is not negligible in\nthe outer disks, and subject to significant large-scale spatial variations. For\nboth galaxies the radial abundance gradient flattens to a constant value\noutside of the isophotal radius. The outer disk O/H abundance ratio is highly\nhomogeneous, with a scatter of only ~0.06 dex. Based on the excitation and\nchemical (N/O ratio) analysis we find no compelling evidence for variations in\nthe upper initial mass function of the ionizing clusters of extended disks. The\nO/H abundance in the outer disks of the target galaxies corresponds to 35% of\nthe solar value (or higher, depending on the metallicity diagnostic). This\nconflicts with the notion that metallicities in extended disks of spiral\ngalaxies are necessarily low. The observed metal enrichment cannot be produced\nwith the current level of star formation. We discuss the possibility that metal\ntransport mechanisms from the inner disks lead to metal pollution of the outer\ndisks. Gas accretion from the intergalactic medium, enriched by outflows,\noffers an alternative solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 16:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We focus on redshift\nmeasurement errors, on the reconstruction of the underlying real-space\nclustering and on the apparent degeneracy existing with the geometrical\ndistortions induced by the cosmology-dependent conversion of redshifts into\ndistances. We use a suite of mock catalogues extracted from large N-body\nsimulations, focusing on the analysis of intermediate, mildly non-linear scales\nand apply the standard linear dispersion model to fit the anisotropy of the\nobserved correlation function. We verify that redshift errors up to ~0.2% have\na negligible impact on the precision with which the specific growth rate beta\ncan be measured. Larger redshift errors introduce a positive systematic error,\nwhich can be alleviated by adopting a Gaussian distribution function of\npairwise velocities. This is, in any case, smaller than the systematic error of\nup to 10% due to the limitations of the linear dispersion model, which is\nstudied in a separate paper. We then show that 50% of the statistical error\nbudget on beta depends on the deprojection procedure through which the\nreal-space correlation function is obtained. Finally, we demonstrate that the\ndegeneracy with geometric distortions can in fact be circumvented. This is\nobtained through a modified version of the Alcock-Paczynski test in\nredshift-space, which successfully recovers the correct cosmology by searching\nfor the solution that optimizes the description of dynamical redshift\ndistortions. For a flat cosmology, we obtain largely independent, robust\nconstraints on beta and OmegaM.

The Chandra lightcurve shows a high\nvariability but its analysis fails to detect any coherent periodicity up to a\nfrequency of 0.05 Hz. The analysis of the Chandra HETG spectrum shows that, to\ncorrectly describe the spectrum, three model components are needed. Two of\nthose components are optically thin thermal plasmas of different temperatures\n(kT~8-9 and 0.2-0.3 keV respectively). Two different models seem to describe\nwell the third component. One possibility is a third hot optically thin thermal\nplasma at kT=16-21 keV with an Fe abundance Z~0.3Zo, definitely smaller than\nfor the other two thermal components. Alternatively, the third component can be\ndescribed by a powerlaw with a photon index Gamma=1.56. In either case, the\nChandra HETG spectrum establishes that each one of these components must be\nmodified by distinct absorption columns. The analysis of a non contemporaneous\n25 ks Suzaku observation shows the presence of a hard tail extending up to at\nleast 33 keV. The Suzaku spectrum is described with the sum of two components:\nan optically thin thermal plasma at kT ~ 9 keV and a very hot second plasma\nwith kT ~33 keV or, alternatively, a powerlaw with photon index Gamma=1.58.

In this paper, we propose and study an algorithm, called\nSparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), to cluster data points that lie in a union of\nlow-dimensional subspaces. The key idea is that, among infinitely many possible\nrepresentations of a data point in terms of other points, a sparse\nrepresentation corresponds to selecting a few points from the same subspace.\nThis motivates solving a sparse optimization program whose solution is used in\na spectral clustering framework to infer the clustering of data into subspaces.\nSince solving the sparse optimization program is in general NP-hard, we\nconsider a convex relaxation and show that, under appropriate conditions on the\narrangement of subspaces and the distribution of data, the proposed\nminimization program succeeds in recovering the desired sparse representations.\nThe proposed algorithm can be solved efficiently and can handle data points\nnear the intersections of subspaces. Another key advantage of the proposed\nalgorithm with respect to the state of the art is that it can deal with data\nnuisances, such as noise, sparse outlying entries, and missing entries,\ndirectly by incorporating the model of the data into the sparse optimization\nprogram.

In the solid state, a well-known case is an impurity\ncoupled to a bosonic bath, for example lattice vibrations. Here the impurity\ntogether with its accompanying lattice distortion form a new entity, a polaron.\nThis quasiparticle plays an important role in the spectral function of high-Tc\nsuperconductors as well as in colossal-magnetoresistance in manganites. For\nimpurities in a fermionic bath, the attention so far has been mostly on heavy\nor immobile impurities which exhibit Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe and\nthe Kondo effect. Only recently, mobile impurities have moved into the focus of\nresearch and they have been found to form new quasiparticles, so called Fermi\npolarons. The Fermi polaron problem constitutes the extreme, but conceptually\nsimple, limit of two important quantum many-body problems: the BEC-BCS\ncrossover with spin-imbalance for attractive interactions and Stoner's\nitinerant ferromagnetism for repulsive interactions. It has been proposed that\nthis and other yet elusive exotic quantum phases might become realizable in\nFermi gases confined to two dimensions. Their stability and observability is\nintimately related to the theoretically debated properties of the Fermi polaron\nin two dimensional Fermi gas. Here we create and investigate these Fermi\npolarons and measure their spectral function using momentum-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy. For attractive interactions we find evidence for\nthe disputed pairing transition between polarons and tightly bound dimers,\nwhich provides insight into the elementary pairing mechanism of imbalanced,\nstrongly-coupled two-dimensional Fermi gases. Additionally, for repulsive\ninteractions we study novel quasiparticles, repulsive polarons, whose lifetime\ndetermine the possibility of stabilizing repulsively interacting Fermi systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 19:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

In many applications, more\nflexible mesh geometries that can dynamically adjust to the problem at hand and\nmove with the flow in a (quasi) Lagrangian fashion would, however, be highly\ndesirable, as this can allow a significant reduction of advection errors and an\naccurate realization of curved and moving boundary conditions. Here we describe\na novel formulation of viscous continuum hydrodynamics that solves the\nequations of motion on a Voronoi mesh created by a set of mesh-generating\npoints. The points can move in an arbitrary manner, but the most natural motion\nis that given by the fluid velocity itself, such that the mesh dynamically\nadjusts to the flow. Owing to the mathematical properties of the Voronoi\ntessellation, pathological mesh-twisting effects are avoided. Our\nimplementation considers the full Navier-Stokes equations and has been realized\nin the AREPO code both in 2D and 3D. We propose a new approach to compute\naccurate viscous fluxes for a dynamic Voronoi mesh, and use this to formulate a\nfinite volume solver of the Navier-Stokes equations. Through a number of test\nproblems, including circular Couette flow and flow past a cylindrical obstacle,\nwe show that our new scheme combines good accuracy with geometric flexibility,\nand hence promises to be competitive with other highly refined Eulerian\nmethods. This will in particular allow astrophysical applications of the AREPO\ncode where physical viscosity is important, such as in the hot plasma in galaxy\nclusters, or for viscous accretion disk models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Multiple driving processes of such winds\nhave been proposed, including thermal pressure due to supernova-heating, UV\nradiation pressure on dust grains, or cosmic ray (CR) pressure. We here study\nwind formation due to CR physics using a numerical model that accounts for CR\nacceleration by supernovae, CR thermalization, and advective CR transport. In\naddition, we introduce a novel implementation of CR streaming relative to the\nrest frame of the gas. We find that CR streaming drives powerful and sustained\nwinds in galaxies with virial masses M_200 < 10^{11} Msun. In dwarf galaxies\n(M_200 ~ 10^9 Msun) the winds reach a mass loading factor of ~5, expel ~60 per\ncent of the initial baryonic mass contained inside the halo's virial radius and\nsuppress the star formation rate by a factor of ~5. In dwarfs, the winds are\nspherically symmetric while in larger galaxies the outflows transition to\nbi-conical morphologies that are aligned with the disc's angular momentum axis.\nWe show that damping of Alfven waves excited by streaming CRs provides a means\nof heating the outflows to temperatures that scale with the square of the\nescape speed. In larger haloes (M_200 > 10^{11} Msun), CR streaming is able to\ndrive fountain flows that excite turbulence. For halo masses M_200 > 10^{10}\nMsun, we predict an observable level of H-alpha and X-ray emission from the\nheated halo gas. We conclude that CR-driven winds should be crucial in\nsuppressing and regulating the first epoch of galaxy formation, expelling a\nlarge fraction of baryons, and - by extension - aid in shaping the faint end of\nthe galaxy luminosity function. They should then also be responsible for much\nof the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 23:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

These putative discrepancies could\nall be alleviated if the stellar IMF is systematically weighted toward more\nhigh-mass star formation in rapidly star-forming galaxies. Here, we explore how\nthe IMF might vary under the central assumption that the turnover mass in the\nIMF, Mc, scales with the Jeans mass in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), M_J. We\nemploy hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of galaxies to predict\nhow the typical GMC Jeans mass, and hence the IMF, varies with galaxy property.\nWe then study the impact of such an IMF on the star formation law, the SFR-M*\nrelation, submillimetre galaxies (SMGs), and the cosmic SFR density. Our main\nresults are: The H2 mass-weighted Jeans mass in a galaxy scales with the SFR\nwhen the SFR is greater a few M_sun/yr. SPS modeling shows that this results in\na nonlinear relation between SFR and Lbol, such that SFR Lbol^0.88. Using this\nmodel relation, the inferred SFR of local ULIRGs decreases by ~2, and that of\nhigh-z SMGs decreases by ~3-5. At z 2, this results in a lowered normalisation\nof the SFR-M* relation in better agreement with models, a reduced discrepancy\nbetween the observed cosmic SFR density and stellar mass density evolution, and\nSMG SFRs that are easier to accommodate in current hierarchical structure\nformation models.

Variability studies of BALs\nhelp illuminate the structure, evolution, and basic physical properties of the\noutflows. Here we present further results from an ongoing BAL monitoring\ncampaign of a sample of 24 luminous quasars at redshifts 1.2 < z < 2.9. We\ndirectly compare the variabilities in the CIV 1549 and SiIV 1400 absorption to\ntry to ascertain the cause(s) of the variability. We find that SiIV BALs are\nmore likely to vary than CIV BALs. When looking at flow speeds >-20 000 km/s,\n47 per cent of quasars exhibited SiIV variability while 31 per cent exhibited\nCIV variability. Furthermore, ~50 per cent of the variable SiIV regions did not\nhave corresponding CIV variability at the same velocities. When both CIV and\nSiIV varied, those changes always occurred in the same sense (either getting\nweaker or stronger). We also include our full data set so far in this paper,\nwhich includes up to 10 epochs of data per quasar. The multi-epoch data show\nthat the BAL changes were not generally monotonic across the full ~5 to ~8 yr\ntime span of our observations, suggesting that the characteristic time-scale\nfor significant line variations, and (perhaps) for structural changes in the\noutflows, is less than a few years. Coordinated variabilities between\nabsorption regions at different velocities in individual quasars seems to favor\nchanging ionization of the outflowing gas as the cause of the observed BAL\nvariability. However, variability in limited portions of broad troughs fits\nnaturally in a scenario where movements of individual clouds, or substructures\nin the flow, across our lines-of-sight cause the absorption to vary. The actual\nsituation may be a complex mixture of changing ionization and cloud movements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 21:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In\nthis paper we discuss various ways of using these high resolution data to\nconstrain velocity power spectrum in galaxy clusters. We argue that variations\nof these quantities with the projected distance R in cool core clusters contain\nimportant information on the velocity field length scales in the ICM. The\neffective length $l_{\\rm eff}$ along the line of sight, which provides dominant\ncontribution to the line flux, increases with R, allowing one to probe the\namplitude of the velocity variations at different spatial scales. In\nparticular, we show that the width of the line as a function of R is closely\nlinked to the structure function of the 3D velocity field. Yet another easily\nobtainable proxy of the velocity field length scales is the ratio of the\namplitude of the projected velocity field (line energy) variations to the\ndispersion of the velocity along the line of sight (line width). Finally the\nprojected velocity field can be easily converted into 3D velocity field,\nespecially for clusters like Coma with an extended flat core in the surface\nbrightness. Under assumption of a homogeneous isotropic Gaussian 3D velocity\nfield we derived simple expressions relating the power spectrum of the 3D\nvelocity field (or structure function) and the observables. The uncertainties\nin the observables, caused by stochastic nature of the velocity field, are\nestimated by making multiple realizations of the random Gaussian velocity field\nand evaluating the scatter in observables.

The internal\nneuronal dynamics of the patch is not described by the model, rather it is\nsubsumed into an effective description in terms of graded Potts units, with\nadaptation effects both specific to each attractor state and generic to the\npatch. If each unit, or patch, receives effective (tensor) connections from C\nother units, the network has been shown to be able to store a large number p of\nglobal patterns, or network attractors, each with a fraction a of the units\nactive, where the critical load p_c scales roughly like p_c ~ (C S^2)/(a\nln(1/a)) (if the patterns are randomly correlated). Interestingly, after\nretrieving an externally cued attractor, the network can continue jumping, or\nlatching, from attractor to attractor, driven by adaptation effects. The\noccurrence and duration of latching dynamics is found through simulations to\ndepend critically on the strength of local attractor states, expressed in the\nPotts model by a parameter w.

The link between external\nstimulus and neural response can be studied from two parallel points of view.\nThe first, neural encoding refers to the mapping from stimulus to response, and\nprimarily focuses on understanding how neurons respond to a wide variety of\nstimuli, and on constructing models that accurately describe the\nstimulus-response relationship. Neural decoding, on the other hand, refers to\nthe reverse mapping, from response to stimulus, where the challenge is to\nreconstruct a stimulus from the spikes it evokes. Since neuronal response is\nstochastic, a one-to-one mapping of stimuli into neural responses does not\nexist, causing a mismatch between the two viewpoints of neural coding. Here, we\nuse these two perspectives to investigate the question of what rate coding is,\nin the simple setting of a single stationary stimulus parameter and a single\nstationary spike train represented by a renewal process. We show that when rate\ncodes are defined in terms of encoding, i.e., the stimulus parameter is mapped\nonto the mean firing rate, the rate decoder given by spike counts or the sample\nmean, does not always efficiently decode the rate codes, but can improve\nefficiency in reading certain rate codes, when correlations within a spike\ntrain are taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 00:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-07"}

(Note that L\nmight be exponential in n.) Bille et al. showed a data structure that uses\nspace O(n) and allows to query for the i-th character of s using running time\nO(log L). Their data structure works on a word RAM with a word size of logL\nbits. Here we prove that for such data structures, if the space is poly(n),\nthen the query time must be at least (log L)^{1-\\epsilon}/log S where S is the\nspace used, for any constant eps>0.

For practical purposes, the chiral\nfermionic sector of Lee-wick theories requires two Lee-Wick partners per\nfermion which opens up the possibility for a negative energy density of the\nearly universe. A toy Lee-Wick model with one fermionic partner relaxes such\noddities and hence easy to deal with. In a similar way, the longitudinal\ndegrees of freedom of the massive gauge boson partners also have the potential\nto yield negative energy densities and thus those will be neglected in a toy\nmodel study. In such a toy model one can analytically calculate the\ntime-temperature relation in the very early radiation dominated universe which\nshows interesting new physics. The article also tries to point out how a\nLee-Wick particle dominated early cosmology transforms into the standard\ncosmological model.

The spectra are consistent with the\nblackbody radiation, whose temperature is 2.2 keV and 1.2 keV at MJD 55858.56\nand 55859.20, respectively. The fluence is $1.4 \\times 10^{42}$ erg in 2-20 keV\nassuming 8.7 kpc distance. The sphere radius of the blackbody and its\nluminosity are estimated to be 6.2 km and $1.1 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nrespectively, from the spectral fitting at the flux peak. Those e-folding time,\ntemperature, softening, fluence, and radius are typical of superbursts from the\nlow-mass X-ray binaries. The superburst was followed by an outburst 28 hours\nafter the superburst onset. The outburst lasted for 5 days and the fluence was\n$4.3 \\times 10^{42}$ erg. The instability of the accretion disk caused by the\nsuperburst would be an explanation for the outburst, whereas the mass accretion\nof the matter evaporated from surface of the companion star by the superburst\nwould be another possibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 09:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

Up to now\nall known planets of giant stars orbit at relatively far distances from their\nhost stars. It is not known whether intermediate-mass stars also had many\nclose-in planets when they were on the main sequence, which were then engulfed\nwhen the star became a giant star. To understand the formation and evolution of\nplanets it is therefore important to find out whether main-sequence stars of\nintermediate-mass have close-in planets or not. A survey for transiting planets\nof intermediate-mass stars would be ideal to solve this question, because the\ndetection of transiting planets is not affected by the rapid rotation of these\nstars. As a first step for an efficient survey we need to identify\nintermediate-mass stars in the CoRoT-fields, which can then be used as an input\nlist. To compile the input list we derived the spectral types of essentially\nall O, B and A stars down to 14.5 mag in the CoRoT fields IRa01, LRa01, LRa02\ntaken with the multi-object spectrograph AAOmega. We determined the spectral\ntypes by comparing the spectra with template spectra from a library. In total\nwe identify 1856 A and B stars that have been observed with CoRoT. Given the\nnumber of planets that have been detected in these fields amongst late-type\nstars, we estimate that there are one to four transiting planets of\nintermediate-mass stars waiting to be discovered. Our survey not only allows us\nto carry out a dedicated planet search programme but is also essential for any\ntypes of studies of the light curves of early-type stars in the CoRoT database.\nWe also show that it would be possible to extend the survey to all fields that\nCoRoT has observed using photometrically determined spectral types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 09:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The shift\nbetween the brightest object and its followers also depends on the signal\norigin. For annihilation, this shift and the stacked signal are poorly\nconstrained because of the large uncertainty affecting the boost.

In the Tidal\nDownsizing hypothesis, an alternative scenario for formation of planets, grain\ngrowth, sedimentation and formation of planetary cores occur inside dense and\nmassive gas clumps formed in the outer cold disc by gravitational instability.\nAs a clump migrates inward, tidal forces of the star remove all or most of the\ngas from the clump, downsizing it to a planetary mass body. Here we argue that\nsuch a clump may form not only the planetary core but also numerous smaller\nbodies. As an example, we consider the simplest case of bodies on circular\norbits around the planetary core in the centre of the gas clump. Bodies smaller\nthan 1 km suffer a strong enough aerodynamic drag, spiral in and accrete onto\nthe solid core rapidly; bodies in the planetesimal size range lose their\ncentrifugal support very slowly. We find that planetesimals orbiting the\nprotoplanetary core closely remain gravitationally bound to it; these may be\nrelevant to formation of satellites of giant planets. Planetesimals on more\ndistant orbits within the host clump are unbound from the protoplanet and are\nset on mildly eccentric heliocentric orbits, generically forming wide rings.\nThese may correspond to debris discs around main sequence stars and the Kuiper\nbelt in the Solar System. For the latter in particular, our hypothesis\nnaturally explains the observed sharp outer edge and the \"mass deficit\" of the\nKuiper belt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 12:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We vary the angular momentum\nand density profiles of the initial gas sphere, the cooling time and the\norientation of the angular momentum vector to study the effects on the\nevolution of the disk. The final disks show realistic structural and kinematic\nproperties. The slower the cooling/accretion processes, the higher the\nkinematic disk-to-bulge ratio D/B of the resulting system. We find that the\ninitial orientation of the gas angular momentum with respect to the halo has a\nmajor effect on the resulting D/B.

We clearly define\nwhat could be defined as centrifugally supported disks and study their\nproperties.

Typically, a main\nfocus of a PVT system is to cool the photovoltaic (PV) cells to improve the\nelectrical performance, however, this causes the thermal component to\nunder-perform compared to a solar thermal collector. The low temperature\ncoefficients of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) allow for the PV cells to be\noperated at higher temperatures and are a potential candidate for a more\nsymbiotic PVT system. The fundamental challenge of a-Si:H PV is light-induced\ndegradation known as the Staebler-Wronski effect (SWE). Fortunately, SWE is\nreversible and the a-Si:H PV efficiency can be returned to its initial state if\nthe cell is annealed. Thus an opportunity exists to deposit a-Si:H directly on\nthe solar thermal absorber plate where the cells could reach the high\ntemperatures required for annealing.\n  In this study, this opportunity is explored experimentally. First a-Si:H PV\ncells were annealed for 1 hour at 100\\degreeC on a 12 hour cycle and for the\nremaining time the cells were degraded at 50\\degreeC in order to simulate\nstagnation of a PVT system for 1 hour once a day.

We apply the\nradiation-driven electron orbits model in the ultraclean scenario. Accordingly,\nwe calculate the elastic scattering rate (charged impurity) which will define\nthe unexpected resonance spike position.

In this chapter we add our two pennies of wisdom, illustrating\nhow the IMF affects various properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters. We\nstart by showing that even relatively small variations of the IMF slope have\nlarge effects on the demography of stellar populations, moving the bulk of the\nstellar mass from one end to the other of the distribution. We then point out\nhow the slope of the IMF in different mass ranges controls specific major\nproperties of galaxies and clusters. The slope of the IMF below ~1 solar mass\ncontrols the M/L ratio of local ellipticals, whereas the slope between ~1 and\n~1.4 solar masses controls the evolution with redshift of such ratio, hence of\nthe fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies. Similarly, the slope between ~1\nand ~40 solar masses drives the ratio of the global metal mass in clusters of\ngalaxies to their total luminosity. While we believe that it is perfectly\nlegitimate to entertain the notion that the IMF may not be universal, our\nmessage is that when proposing IMF variations to ease a specific problem then\none should not neglect to explore the full consequences of the invoked\nvariations.\n  This paper is integrally reproduced from Chapter 8 of the book by L.

In particular, classical statistical mechanics is\nhallmarked by the complementarity between two descriptions that are unified in\nthermodynamics: (i) the parametrization of the system macrostate in terms of\nmechanical macroscopic observables $I=\\{I^{i}\\}$; and (ii) the dynamical\ndescription that explains the evolution of a system towards the thermodynamic\nequilibrium. As expected, such a complementarity is related to the uncertainty\nrelations of classical statistical mechanics $\\Delta I^{i}\\Delta \\eta_{i}\\geq\nk$. Here, $k$ is the Boltzmann's constant, $\\eta_{i}=\\partial\n\\mathcal{S}(I|\\theta)/\\partial I^{i}$ are the restituting generalized forces\nderived from the entropy $\\mathcal{S}(I|\\theta)$ of a closed system, which is\nfound in an equilibrium situation driven by certain control parameters\n$\\theta=\\{\\theta^{\\alpha}\\}$. These arguments constitute the central\ningredients of a reformulation of classical statistical mechanics from the\nnotion of complementarity. In this new framework, Einstein postulate of\nclassical fluctuation theory $dp(I|\\theta)\\sim\\exp[\\mathcal{S}(I|\\theta)/k]dI$\nappears as the correspondence principle between classical statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics in the limit $k\\rightarrow0$, while the existence of\nuncertainty relations can be associated with the non-commuting character of\ncertain operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 04:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-31"}

Organizations must constantly adapt to changing\ncircumstances and search for new possibilities of gaining competitive\nadvantage. To face this challenge, small organizations base their operation on\ncollaboration within Virtual Organizations (VOs). VO operation is based on\ncollaborative processes. Due to dynamism and required flexibility of\ncollaborative processes, existing business information systems are insufficient\nto efficiently support them. In this paper a novel method for supporting\ncollaborative processes based on process mining techniques is proposed. The\nmethod allows activity patterns in various instances of collaborative processes\nto be identified and used for recommendation of activities. This provides an\nopportunity for better computer support of collaborative processes leading to\nmore efficient and effective realization of business goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 13:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-22"}
