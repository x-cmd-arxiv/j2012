We investigate the effect\nof harmonic confinement on the internal degrees of freedom, as the ratio of\nzero-point harmonic oscillator length to classical soliton length, for\ndifferent numbers of atoms. We derive a first-order energy correction for the\naddition of a harmonic potential to the many-body wave function and use this to\ncreate a variational technique based on energy minimization of this wave\nfunction for an arbitrary number of atoms, and include numerics based on\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a basis of harmonic oscillator Fock\nstates.

In such a system the solute dissociates\ncompletely into two species of ions with unlike charges. The mathematical\ndescription consists of a diffusion equation for each species augmented by\ntransport due to a self consistent electrostatic field determined by the\nPoisson equation. This mathematical framework also describes other important\nproblems in physics such as electron and hole diffusion across semi-conductor\njunctions and the diffusion of ions in plasmas. If concentrations do not vary\nappreciably over distances of the order of the Debye length, the Poisson\nequation can be replaced by the condition of local charge neutrality first\nintroduced by Planck. It can then be shown that both species diffuse at the\nsame rate with a common diffusivity that is intermediate between that of the\nslow and fast species (ambipolar diffusion). Here we derive a more general\ntheory by exploiting the ratio of Debye length to a characteristic length scale\nas a small asymptotic parameter. It is shown that the concentration of either\nspecies may be described by a nonlinear integro-differential equation which\nreplaces the classical linear equation for ambipolar diffusion but reduces to\nit in the appropriate limit.

Here we have used a Hinode SOT/SP deep\nmode data set for the quiet-sun disk center in combination with constraints\nfrom the Hanle effect to derive scaling laws that describe how the magnetic\nstructuring varies from the resolved scales down to the magnetic diffusion\nlimit, where the field ceases to be frozen-in. The focus of the analysis is a\nderivation of the magnetic energy spectrum, but we also discuss the scale\ndependence of the probability density function (PDF) for the flux densities and\nthe role of the cancellation function for the average unsigned flux density.\nAnalysis of the Hinode data set with the line-ratio method reveals a collapsed\nflux population in the form of flux tubes with a size distribution that is\npeaked in the 10-100 km range. Magnetic energy is injected into this scale\nrange by the instability mechanism of flux tube collapse, which is driven by\nthe external gas pressure in the superadiabatic region at the top of the\nconvection zone. This elevates the magnetic energy spectrum just beyond the\ntelescope resolution limit. Flux tube decay feeds an inertial range that\ncascades down the scale spectrum to the magnetic diffusion limit, and which\ncontains the tangled, \"hidden\" flux that is known to exist from observations of\nthe Hanle effect. The observational constraints demand that the total magnetic\nenergy in the hidden flux must be of the same order as the total energy in the\nkG flux tubes. Both the flux tubes and the hidden flux are found to be\npreferentially located in the intergranular lanes, which is to be expected\nsince they are physically related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 16:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Therefore, it\nis not surprising that companies like Google, Yahoo, and Netflix already\nreplicate user data across geographically different regions.\n  However, replication across data centers is expensive. Inter-data center\nnetwork delays are in the hundreds of milliseconds and vary significantly.\nSynchronous wide-area replication is therefore considered to be unfeasible with\nstrong consistency and current solutions either settle for asynchronous\nreplication which implies the risk of losing data in the event of failures,\nrestrict consistency to small partitions, or give up consistency entirely. With\nMDCC (Multi-Data Center Consistency), we describe the first optimistic commit\nprotocol, that does not require a master or partitioning, and is strongly\nconsistent at a cost similar to eventually consistent protocols. MDCC can\ncommit transactions in a single round-trip across data centers in the normal\noperational case. We further propose a new programming model which empowers the\napplication developer to handle longer and unpredictable latencies caused by\ninter-data center communication. Our evaluation using the TPC-W benchmark with\nMDCC deployed across 5 geographically diverse data centers shows that MDCC is\nable to achieve throughput and latency similar to eventually consistent quorum\nprotocols and that MDCC is able to sustain a data center outage without a\nsignificant impact on response times while guaranteeing strong consistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 19:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-28"}

The pipeline briefly described here is also\napplicable to other astrophysical scenarios such as star forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 19:16:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 21:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this paper we investigate the effect of\nneglecting precession on the sensitivity of searches for spinning binaries\nusing non-spinning waveform models.

The method gives the correct\nbehavior in all of the relevant limits (dominated by the central point source;\ndominated by the distributed isotropic source; optically thin; optically thick\nto UV/optical; optically thick to IR) and reasonably interpolates between the\nlimits when necessary. The method is explicitly energy conserving so that\nUV/optical photons that are absorbed are not lost, but are rather redistributed\nto the IR where they may scatter out of the galaxy. We implement the radiative\ntransfer algorithm in a two-dimensional hydrodynamical code designed to study\nfeedback processes in the context of early-type galaxies. We find that the\ndynamics and final state of simulations are measurably but only moderately\naffected by radiative forces on dust, even when assumptions about the\ndust-to-gas ratio are varied from zero to a value appropriate for the Milky\nWay. In simulations with high gas densities designed to mimic ULIRGs with a\nstar formation rate of several hundred solar masses per year, dust makes a more\nsubstantial contribution to the dynamics and outcome of the simulation.

One of them, the\nstarburst/Seyfert composite galaxy IRAS 01072+4954 (z=0.0236), has a typical\nType~1 X-ray emission, while its optical spectrum resembles an HII galaxy and\nlacks the expected broad lines. We performed near-infrared integral-field\nobservations of this object with the aim to determine the nature of its nuclear\nemission and to find indications for the existence or absence of a broad-line\nregion. Several reasons have been proposed to explain such peculiar emission.\nWe studied the validity of such hypotheses, including the possibility for it to\nbe True-Seyfert~2. We found little obscuration towards the nucleus A_V = 2.5\nmag, and a nuclear star-formation rate Sigma_SFR < 11.6 Msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2},\nwhich is below the average in Seyferts. Unresolved hot-dust emission with T ~\n1150 K seems to indicate the presence of a torus with its axis close to the\nline of sight. We found that IRAS 01072+4954 hosts a low mass black hole with\nan estimated mass of M_BH ~ 10^5 Msun and an upper limit of 2.5x10^6 Msun. Its\nbolometric luminosity is L_bol ~ 2.5x10^{42} erg/s, which yields a high\naccretion rate with an Eddington ratio ~ 0.2. If the relations found in more\nmassive systems also apply to this case, then IRAS 01072+4954 should show broad\nemission lines with FWHM_{broad} ~(400-600) km/s. Indeed, some indications for\nsuch narrow broad-line components are seen in our data, but the evidence is not\nyet conclusive. This source thus seems not to be a True-Seyfert 2, but an\nextreme case of a narrow line Seyfert 1, which, due to the faintness of the\nactive nucleus, does not have strong FeII emission in the optical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 20:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}

Guided by\nstudies of intrinsic infra-red AGN SEDs, we show that the majority of the FIR\nemission in AGNs is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. We uncover\ncharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean FIR luminosity\n(L_fir) and accretion luminosity (L_agn) of AGNs. At low AGN luminosities,\naccretion and SFR are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenario\nwhere most low-luminosity AGNs are primarily fueled by secular processes in\ntheir host galaxies. At high AGN luminosities, a significant correlation is\nobserved between L_fir and L_agn, but only among AGNs at low and moderate\nredshifts (z<1). We interpret this as a signature of the increasing importance\nof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes\n(SMBHs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high AGN luminosities.\nHowever, we also find that the enhancement of SFR in luminous AGNs weakens or\ndisappears at high redshifts (z>1). This suggests that the role of mergers in\nSMBH-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. At all redshifts,\nwe find essentially no relationship between L_fir and nuclear obscuration\nacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting that\nvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring X-rays\nin active galaxies. We explain our results within a scenario in which two\ndifferent modes of SMBH fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity AGNs. We\npostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshift\ngalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity AGNs\nevolves with redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 14:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

In addition,\nmost of the observational consequences are directly related to this symmetry\nand hence are correlated. Large tensor modes can be accompanied by the\nobservable effects of a the shift-symmetric coupling $\\phi F\\tilde F$ to a\ngauge field. During inflation this coupling leads to a copious production of\ngauge quanta and consequently a very distinct modification of the primordial\ncurvature perturbations. In this work we compare these predictions with\nobservations. We find that the leading constraint on the model comes from the\nCMB power spectrum when considering both WMAP 7-year and ACT data. The\nbispectrum generated by the non-Gaussian inverse-decay of the gauge field leads\nto a comparable but slightly weaker constraint.

It is usually assumed that secondary\nnuclei such as Li-Be-B are entirely generated by collisions of heavier CR\nnuclei with the interstellar medium (ISM). We study the CR propagation under a\nscenario where secondary nuclei can also be produced or accelerated from\ngalactic sources. We consider the processes of hadronic interactions inside\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) and re-acceleration of background CRs in strong\nshocks. Thus, we investigate their impact in the propagation parameter\ndetermination within present and future data. The spectra of Li-Be-B nuclei\nemitted from SNRs are harder than those due to CR collisions with the ISM. The\nsecondary-to-primary ratios flatten significantly at ~TeV/n energies, both from\nspallation and re-acceleration in the sources. The two mechanisms are\ncomplementary to each other and depend on the properties of the local ISM\naround the expanding remnants. The secondary production in SNRs is significant\nfor dense background media, n ~1 cm^-3, while the amount of re-accelerated CRs\nis relevant for SNRs expanding into rarefied media, n ~0.1 cm-3. Due to these\neffects, the the diffusion parameter 'delta' may be misunderstood by a factor\nof ~5-15%.

Removal of a message on a link in\none direction does not necessarily imply the removal of the message on that\nlink in the other direction.

We also discovered shorter timescale\nvariations than in the previous observations: (1) the first, of ~7 days, is\ninterpreted as due to \"reverberation\" of the variation of the ionizing source\nluminosity, and the timescale of 7 days as the light crossing time between the\nsource and the accretion disk; this new timescale and its interpretation\nprovides a distance between the emitting gas and the supermassive black hole\nand as such introduces a new constraint on its mass; (2) the second, of\napproximately 5 months, was attributed to the rotation of a spiral arm in the\ndisk, which was found to occur on the dynamical timescale. We use two accretion\ndisk models to fit theoretical profiles to the new data, both having\nnon-axisymmetric emissivities produced by the presence of an one-armed spiral.\nOur modeling constrains the rotation period for the spiral to be approximately\n18 months.

With this insight, we consider a social\nnetwork which consists of many cliques and information can spread quickly\nwithin a clique. Furthermore, information can also be shared through online\nsocial networks, such as Facebook, twitter, Youtube, etc.\n  We characterize the diffusion of real-time information by studying the phase\ntransition behaviors.

In most existing studies, the BBH systems are treated\nas isolated systems, while the effect of the background is ignored. The\nvalidity of the approximation is based on the belief that the background\ngravitational field from other sources is extremely weak compared with the\nstrong gravitational field produced by the BBH itself during the evolution, and\ncan be neglected in gravitational wave detection. However, it is still\ninteresting to check how valid this approximation is. In this work, instead of\nsimulating the three-BH problem with a fully relativistic treatment, we use a\nperturbational scheme to investigate the effect of the background gravitational\npotential on the evolution of a BBH, especially on the waveform of its\ngravitational radiation. Four scenarios are considered including the head-on\ncollision and the inspiral-to-merger process of a BBH which is either\nfreefalling towards or circularly orbiting around a third large BH. The head-on\ncollision and the circular inspiral are two limits of all possible\nconfigurations. The existence of the background gravitational potential changes\nthe arrival time of the gravitational wavefront of a BH, prolongs the\nwavelength, and increases the gravitational radiation energy. And most\ninterestingly, the background gravitational potential induces the higher-order\nmodes of the gravitational wave of a BBH. These interesting phenomena can be\nexplained by the gravitational redshift effect and the change of eccentricity\nof a BBH's orbit from the background gravitational potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 07:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

To improve quality in the 3D mass mapping using 3D-lensing, we\ncombine the lensing information with the spatial clustering of a population of\ngalaxies that trace the matter density with a known galaxy bias (defined as\ntracers). For our minimum variance estimator, merely all the second-order bias\nof the tracers has to be known, which can in principle be self-consistently\nconstrained in the data by lensing techniques. This synergy introduces a new\nnoise component because of the stochasticity in the matter-tracer density\nrelation. We give a description of the stochasticity noise in the Gaussian\nregime, and we investigate the estimator characteristics analytically. We apply\nthe estimator to a mock survey based on the Millennium Simulation. The\nestimator linearly mixes the individual lensing mass and tracer number density\nmaps into a combined smoothed mass map. The weighting in the mix depends on the\nS/N of the individual maps and the correlation, $r$, between the matter and\ngalaxy density. The weight of the tracers can be reduced by hand. For moderate\nmixing, the S/N in the mass map improves by a factor $\\sim2-3$ for\n$r\\gtrsim0.4$; the systematic offset between a true and apparent mass peak\ndistance ($z$-shift bias) in a lensing-only map is eliminated, even for weak\ncorrelations of $r\\sim0.4$. If the second-order bias of tracer galaxies can be\ndetermined, the synergy technique potentially provides an option to improve\nredshift accuracy and completeness of the lensing 3D mass map. However,the\nestimator's performance on sub-degree, non-Gaussian scales depends on all\ndetails in the galaxy bias mechanism and, hence, its accuracy on the choice of\nthe tracer population.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 09:30:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 10:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2013 10:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We assign reasonably\nrealistic profiles to the wind speed and the density along the radial\ndirection, and a radial magnetic field.

There, the magnetic\nfield has a perpendicular power-law spectrum with slope close to the Kolmogorov\n-5/3.

This analysis is done by using 2,264\ndisk-integrated observations of the satellites and a 12x700 pixels-wide rings\nradial mosaic acquired with a spatial resolution of about 125 km/pixel. The\ncomparative analysis of these data allows us to retrieve the amount of both\nwater ice and red contaminant materials distributed across Saturn's system and\nthe typical surface regolith grain sizes.

These TMRCAs have special\ndemographic implications because mtDNA is transmitted only from mother to\nchild, and NRY from father to son. Therefore, mtDNA reflects female history,\nand NRY, male history. To investigate what caused the two-to-one female-male\nTMRCA ratio in humans, we develop a forward-looking agent-based model (ABM)\nwith overlapping generations and individual life cycles. We implement two main\nmating systems: polygynandry and polygyny with different degrees in between. In\neach mating system, the male population can be either homogeneous or\nheterogeneous. In the latter case, some males are `alphas' and others are\n`betas', which reflects the extent to which they are favored by female mates. A\nheterogeneous male population implies a competition among males with the\npurpose of signaling as alphas. The introduction of a heterogeneous male\npopulation is found to reduce by a factor 2 the probability of finding equal\nfemale and male TMRCAs and shifts the distribution of the TMRCA ratio to higher\nvalues. We find that high male-male competition is necessary to reproduce a\nTMRCA ratio of 2: less than half the males can be alphas and betas can have at\nmost half the fitness of alphas. In addition, in the modes that maximize the\nprobability of having a TMRCA ratio between 1.5 and 2.5, the present generation\nhas 1.4 times as many female as male ancestors. We also tested the effect of\nsex-biased migration and sex-specific death rates and found that these are\nunlikely to explain alone the sex-biased TMRCA ratio observed in humans. Our\nresults support the view that we are descended from males who were successful\nin a highly competitive context, while females were facing a much smaller\nfemale-female competition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 11:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}

However a set of recent experiments has shown evidence for inherent\nasymmetries when either a normal or a spin-polarized STM tip is used. In order\nto explain such asymmetries here we expand our previously developed\nperturbative approach to electron-spin scattering to the spin- polarized case\nand to the inclusion of out of equilibrium spin populations. In the case of a\nmagnetic STM tip we demonstrate that the asymmetries are driven by the\nnon-equilibrium occupation of the various atomic spin-levels, an effect that\nreminds closely that electron spin-transfer. In contrast when the tip is not\nspin-polarized such non-equilibrium population cannot be build up.

A\nfull six-valley effective mass model Hamiltonian is adopted. For low fields,\nthe electron ground state is essentially confined at the donor. At high fields\nthe ground state is such that the electron is drawn to the interface, leaving\nthe donor practically ionized. Valley splitting at the interface occurs due to\nthe valley-orbit coupling, V_vo^I = |V_vo^I| e^{i theta}. At intermediate\nelectric fields, close to a characteristic shuttling field, the electron states\nmay constitute hybridized states with valley compositions different from the\ndonor and the interface ground states. The full spectrum of energy levels shows\ncrossings and anti-crossings as the field varies. The degree of level\nrepulsion, thus the width of the anti-crossing gap, depends on the relative\nvalley compositions, which vary with |V_vo^I|, theta and the interface-donor\ndistance.

A sequence of two anti-crossings takes place and the\ncomplex phase theta affects the symmetries of the eigenstates and level\nanti-crossing gaps. We discuss the implications of our results on the practical\nmanipulation of donor electrons in Si nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 12:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 10:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

The results of an extensive numerical\nexperiment are in good agreement with the analytical results, which validates\nour methodology.

This self-calibration\ntechnique utilizes multiple measurements of sources at different focal-plane\npositions to constrain instruments' large-scale response (flat-field) from\nsurvey science data alone. We create an artificial sky of sources and\nsynthetically observe it under four basic survey strategies, creating an\nend-to-end simulation of an imaging survey for each. These catalog-level\nsimulations include realistic measurement uncertainties and a complex\nfocal-plane dependence of the instrument response. In the self-calibration\nstep, we simultaneously fit for all the star fluxes and the parameters of a\nposition-dependent flat-field. For realism, we deliberately fit with a wrong\nnoise model and a flat-field functional basis that does not include the model\nthat generated the synthetic data.

We\ninvestigate how the dust is distributed within and outside the gap, and\nconstrain the disc geometry with mid-infrared interferometric observations\nusing VLTI/MIDI. With baseline lengths of 40m, our long baseline observations\nare sensitive to the inner few AU from the star, and we combined them with\nobservations at shorter, 15m baselines, to probe emission beyond the gap at up\nto 20AU from the star. We modelled the mid-infrared emission using radial\ntemperature profiles. Our model is composed of infinitesimal concentric annuli\nemitting as black bodies, and it has distinct inner and outer disc components.\nWe derived an upper limit of 0.7AU for the radial size of the inner disc, from\nour longest baseline data. This small dusty disc is separated from the edge of\nthe outer disc by a large, roughly 10AU wide gap. Our short baseline data place\na bright ring of emission at 11+-1AU, consistent with prior observations of the\ntransition region between the gap and the outer disc, known as the disc wall.\nThe inclination and position angle are constrained by our data to i=53+-8deg\nand PA=145+-5deg. Compared to the rim and outer disc geometry this suggests\nco-planarity.

The constraints on cosmological parameters derived\nfrom data of SNe Ia and the measurements of the cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies indicate that the dark energy amounts to roughly 70% of all the\nenergy contained in the Universe. In the hypothesis of a flat Universe, we\ninvestigate if the dark energy is really required in order to explain the SNe\nIa experimental data, and, in this case, how much of such unknown energy is\nactually deduced from the analysis of these data and must be introduced in the\nLambdaCDM model of cosmology. In particular we are interested in verifying if\nthe Einstein-de Sitter model of the expanding Universe is really to be ruled\nout. By using a fitting procedure based on the Newton method search for a\nminimum, we reanalyzed the \"Union compilation\" reported by Kowalski et al.\n(2008) formed by 307 SNe, obtaining a very different estimate of the dark\nenergy, that is roughly 60%. Furthermore, in order to balance the correction of\nthe apparent magnitude of SNe Ia, due to the dilation or stretching of the\ncorresponding light curve width, we introduce a suitable modified redsfhit.\nTaking into account this correction, we refitted the Union compilation dataset\nafter a selection cut. The main result that emerges from our analysis is that\nthe values of Omega_m and Omega_Lambda strongly depend on the fitting procedure\nand the selected sample. In particular, the constraint we obtain on the mass\ndensity, normalized by the critical mass density, is Omega_m = 0.7 for a sample\nof 252, and Omega_m = 1 for a sample of 242 SNe Ia respectively. The latter\ncase does not imply the existence of any additional form of dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 13:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-29"}

These systems are able to automatically react to events, by\ncollecting information from outside and internally generating new events.\nHowever, the collection of data is often hampered by uncertainty and vagueness\nthat can arise from the imprecision of the monitoring infrastructure,\nunreliable data sources, and networks. The decision making mechanism used to\nproduce a reaction is also imprecise, and cannot be evaluated in a crisp way.\nIt depends on the evaluation of vague temporal constraints, which are expressed\non the collected data by humans. Despite fuzzy logic has been mainly conceived\nas a mathematical abstraction to express vagueness, no attempt has been made to\nfuzzify the temporal modalities. Existing fuzzy languages do not allow us to\nrepresent temporal properties, such as \"almost always\" and \"soon\". Indeed, the\nsemantics of existing fuzzy temporal operators is based on the idea of\nreplacing classical connectives or propositions with their fuzzy counterparts.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a temporal framework, FTL (Fuzzy-time\nTemporal Logic), to express vagueness on time. This framework formally defines\na set of fuzzy temporal modalities, which can be customized by choosing a\nspecific semantics for the connectives. The semantics of the language is sound,\nand the introduced modalities respect a set of expected mutual relations. We\nalso prove that under the assumption that all events are crisp, FTL reduces to\nLTL. Finally, for some of the possible fuzzy interpretations of the\nconnectives, we identify adequate sets of temporal operators, from which it is\npossible to derive all the others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 14:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-29"}

An improved density-matrix expansion is\nadapted to the situation of small isospin-asymmetries and used to calculate in\nthe Hartree-Fock approximation the density-dependent strength functions\nassociated with the isovector terms. The two-body interaction comprises of\nlong-range multi-pion exchange contributions and a set of contact terms\ncontributing up to fourth power in momenta. In addition, the leading order\nchiral three-nucleon interaction is employed with its parameters fixed in\ncomputations of nuclear few-body systems. With this input one finds for the\nasymmetry energy of nuclear matter the value $A(\\rho_0) \\simeq 26.5\\,$MeV,\ncompatible with existing semi-empirical determinations. The strength functions\nof the isovector surface and spin-orbit coupling terms come out much smaller\nthan those of the analogous isoscalar coupling terms and in the relevant\ndensity range one finds agreement with phenomenological Skyrme forces. The\nspecific isospin- and density-dependences arising from the chiral two- and\nthree-nucleon interactions can be explored and tested in neutron-rich systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 14:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We\nshow that the result is sharp for the Burgers equation. We also prove global\nregularity for a slightly supercritical two-dimensional Euler equation. Our\nmain tool is a nonlocal maximum principle which controls a certain modulus of\ncontinuity of the solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 15:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

In order to handle the issue\nof absorbing acoustic boundary conditions for LBS, three kinds of damping terms\nare proposed and added into the right hand sides of the governing equations of\nLBS. From the classical theory, these terms play an important role to absorb\nand minimize the acoustic wave reflections from computational boundaries.\nMeanwhile, the corresponding macroscopic equations with the damping terms are\nrecovered for analyzing the macroscopic behaviors of the these damping terms\nand determining the critical absorbing strength. Further, in order to detect\nthe dissipation and dispersion behaviors, the linearized LBS with the damping\nterms is derived and analyzed. The dispersive and dissipative properties are\nexplored in the wave-number spaces via the Von Neumann analysis. The related\ndamping strength critical values and the optimal absorbing term are addressed.\nFinally, some benchmark problems are implemented to assess the theoretical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 13:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-30"}

In this zero-sum allocation game two teams of gladiators engage\nin a sequence of one-to-one fights in which the probability of winning is a\nfunction of the gladiators' strengths. Each team's strategy consists of the\nallocation of its total strength among its gladiators. We find the Nash\nequilibria and the value of this class of games and show how they depend on the\ntotal strength of teams and the number of gladiators in each team. To do this,\nwe study interesting majorization-type probability inequalities concerning\nlinear combinations of Gamma random variables. Similar inequalities have been\nused in models of telecommunications and research and development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Mar 2012 20:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}
