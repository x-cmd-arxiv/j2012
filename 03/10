Structural and dynamical similarities of different\nreal networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the\ndynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws\nremain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the\nlarge-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law\ngraph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the\nInternet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural\nsimilarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the\nlarge-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This\nequivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of\ncomplex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network\nscience and cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 18:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 22:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}

Photon orbital angular momentum (POAM) is normally invoked in a\nquantum mechanical context. It can, however, also be adapted to the classical\nregime, which includes observational astronomy.\n  Aims. I explain why POAM quantities are excellent metrics for describing the\nend-to-end behavior of astronomical systems. To demonstrate their utility, I\ncalculate POAM probabilities and torques from holography measurements of EVLA\nantenna surfaces.\n  Methods. With previously defined concepts and calculi, I present generic\nexpressions for POAM spectra, total POAM, torque spectra, and total torque in\nthe image plane. I extend these functional forms to describe the specific POAM\nbehavior of single telescopes and interferometers.\n  Results. POAM probabilities of spatially uncorrelated astronomical sources\nare symmetric in quantum number. Such objects have zero intrinsic total POAM on\nthe celestial sphere, which means that the total POAM in the image plane is\nidentical to the total torque induced by aberrations within propagation media &\ninstrumentation. The total torque can be divided into source- independent and\ndependent components, and the latter can be written in terms of three\nillustrative forms. For interferometers, complications arise from discrete\nsampling of synthesized apertures, but they can be overcome. POAM also\nmanifests itself in the apodization of each telescope in an array. Holography\nof EVLA antennas observing a point source indicate that ~ 10% of photons in the\nn = 0 state are torqued to n != 0 states.\n  Conclusions. POAM quantities represent excellent metrics for characterizing\ninstruments because they are used to simultaneously describe amplitude and\nphase aberrations. In contrast, Zernike polynomials are just solutions of a\ndifferential equation that happen to ~ correspond to specific types of\naberrations and are typically employed to fit only phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 16:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The\nredshift dependence of the IA signal has been used at the 2-point level to\nreduce this contamination by only measuring cross-correlations between large\nredshift bins, which significantly reduces the galaxy intrinsic ellipticity -\nintrinsic ellipticity (II) correlation. A self-calibration technique based on\nthe redshift dependences of the IA correlations has also been proposed as a\nmeans to remove the 2-point IA contamination from the lensing signal. We\nexplore here the redshift dependences of the IA and lensing bispectra in order\nto propose a self-calibration of the IA auto-correlations at the 3-point level\n(i.e. GGI, GII, and III), which can be well understood without the assumption\nof any particular IA model. We find that future weak lensing surveys will be\nable to measure the distinctive IA redshift dependence over ranges of $|\\Delta\nz^P|\\le 0.2$. Using conservative estimates of photo-z accuracy, we describe the\n3-point self-calibration technique for the total IA signal, which can be\naccomplished through lensing tomography of photo-z bin size $\\sim 0.01$. We\nfind that the 3-point self-calibration can function at the accuracy of the\n2-point technique with modest constraints in redshift separation. This allows\nthe 3-point IA auto-correlation self-calibration technique proposed here to\nsignificantly reduce the contamination of the IA contamination to the weak\nlensing bispectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 17:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Their selection does not depend on\ntheir kinematics. Light curves and ephemerides are given for 7 previously\nunknown RR Lyrae stars. All but 4 of the RR Lyrae stars are of Oosterhoff type\nI. Our selection criteria for BHB stars give results that agree with those used\nby Smith et al. (2010) and Ruhland et al. (2011). We use 5 methods to determine\ndistances for the BHB stars and 3 methods for the RR Lyrae stars to get\ndistances on a uniform scale. Absolute proper motions (largely derived from the\nGSCII and SDSS (DR7) databases) are given for these stars; radial velocities\nare given for 31 of the BHB stars and 37 of the RR Lyrae stars. Combining these\ndata for BHB and RR Lyrae stars with those previously found in fields at the\nNorth Galactic Pole, we find that retrograde orbits dominate for galactocentric\ndistances greater than 12.5 kpc. The majority of metal-poor stars in the solar\nneighbourhood are known to be concentrated in a Lperp vs. Lz angular momentum\nplot. We show that the ratio of the number of outliers to the number in the\nmain concentration increases with galactocentric distance. The location of\nthese outliers with Lperp and Lz shows that the halo BHB and RR Lyrae stars\nhave more retrograde orbits and a more spherical distribution with increasing\ngalactocentric distance. Six RR Lyrae stars are identified in the H99 group of\noutliers; the small spread in their [Fe/H] suggests that they could have come\nfrom a single globular cluster. Another group of outliers contains two pairs of\nRR Lyrae stars; the stars in each pair have similar properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 17:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We\ncompare these data to a series of Monte Carlo simulations to infer the\nintrinsic binary fraction and distributions of mass ratios, periods, and\neccentricities. We model the distribution of mass ratio, log-period, and\neccentricity as power-laws and find best fitting indices of alpha=0.1+/-0.5,\nbeta=0.2+/-0.4, and gamma=-0.6+/-0.3 respectively. These distributions indicate\na preference for massive companions, short periods, and low eccentricities. Our\nanalysis indicates that the binary fraction of the cluster is 44+/-8% if all\nbinary systems are (artificially) assumed to have P<1000 days; if the power-law\nperiod distribution is extrapolated to 10^4 years, a plausible upper limit for\nbound systems, the binary fraction is ~90+/-10%. Of these binary (or higher\norder) systems, ~45% will have companions close enough to interact during pre-\nor post-main-sequence evolution (semi-major axis ~/<4.7 AU). The period\ndistribution for P<27 days is not well reproduced by any single power-law owing\nto an excess of systems with periods around 3-5 days (0.08-0.31 AU) and a\nrelative shortage of systems with periods around 7-14 days (0.14-0.62 AU).

It is known that if we\nmove away from the simple cosmological constant model then we need to consider\nperturbations in the dark energy fluid. This means that dark energy has two\nextra degrees of freedom: the sound speed $\\cs$ and the anisotropic stress\n$\\sigma$. If dark energy is inhomogenous at the scales of interest then the\ngravitational potentials are modified and the evolution of the dark matter\nperturbations is also directly affected. In this paper we add an anisotropic\ncomponent to the dark energy perturbations. Following the idea introduced in\n\\cite{Sapone:2009mb}, we solve analytically the equations of perturbations in\nthe dark sector, finding simple and accurate approximated solutions. We also\nfind that the evolution of the density perturbations is governed by an\neffective sound speed which depends on both the sound speed and the anisotropic\nstress parameter. We then use these solutions to look at the impact of the dark\nenergy perturbations on the matter power spectrum and on the Integrated\nSachs-Wolfe effect in the Cosmic Microwave Background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 18:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

It comprises action functionals which\ndepend on the tetrad field (along with the related background and ghost fields)\nand are invariant under the semi-direct product of spacetime diffeomorphisms\nand local Lorentz transformations. This theory space differs from that of\nQuantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) in that the tetrad rather than the metric\nconstitutes the fundamental variable and because of the additional symmetry\nrequirement of local Lorentz invariance. It also differs from \"Quantum Einstein\nCartan Gravity\" (QECG) investigated recently since the spin connection is not\nan independent field variable now. We explicitly compute the renormalization\ngroup flow on this theory space within the tetrad version of the\nEinstein-Hilbert truncation. A detailed comparison with analog results in QEG\nand QECG is performed in order to assess the impact the choice of a fundamental\nfield variable has on the renormalization behavior of the gravitational average\naction, and the possibility of an asymptotically safe infinite cutoff limit is\ninvestigated. Implications for nonperturbative studies of fermionic matter\ncoupled to quantum gravity are also discussed. It turns out that, in the\ncontext of functional flow equations, the \"hybrid calculations\" proposed in the\nliterature (using the tetrad for fermionic diagrams only, and the metric in all\nothers) are unlikely to be quantitatively reliable. Moreover we find that,\nunlike in perturbation theory, the non-propagating Faddeev-Popov ghosts related\nto the local Lorentz transformations may not be discarded but rather contribute\nquite significantly to the beta functions of Newton's constant and the\ncosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 18:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Unfortunately, there is lack of\nefficient tools to automatically track and detect anomalous events on\noperational data, causing ISP operators to rely on manual inspection of this\ndata. While anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of network\ndata, operational data presents several new challenges, including the\nvolatility and sparseness of data, and the need to perform fast detection\n(complicating application of schemes that require offline processing or\nlarge/stable data sets to converge).\n  To address these challenges, we propose Tiresias, an automated approach to\nlocating anomalous events on hierarchical operational data. Tiresias leverages\nthe hierarchical structure of operational data to identify high-impact\naggregates (e.g., locations in the network, failure modes) likely to be\nassociated with anomalous events. To accommodate different kinds of operational\nnetwork data, Tiresias consists of an online detection algorithm with low time\nand space complexity, while preserving high detection accuracy. We present\nresults from two case studies using operational data collected at a large\ncommercial IP network operated by a Tier-1 ISP: customer care call logs and\nset-top box crash logs. By comparing with a reference set verified by the ISP's\noperational group, we validate that Tiresias can achieve >94% accuracy in\nlocating anomalies. Tiresias also discovered several previously unknown\nanomalies in the ISP's customer care cases, demonstrating its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 19:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-12"}

Unfortunately,\ntransport measurements find the expected high mobility only in freely suspended\ngraphen. When supported on a surface, graphene shows a strongly reduced\nmobility, and an especially severe reduction for temperatures above 200 K. A\ntemperature-dependent mobility reduction could be explained by scattering of\ncarriers with phonons, but this is expected to be weak for pristine,\nweakly-doped graphene. The mobility reduction has therefore been ascribed to\nthe interaction with confined ripples or substrate phonons. Here we study the\ntemperature-dependent electronic structure of supported graphene by\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, a technique that can reveal the\norigin of the phenomena observed in transport measurements. We show that the\nelectron-phonon coupling for weakly-doped, supported graphene on a metal\nsurface is indeed extremely weak, reaching the lowest value ever reported for\nany material. However, the temperature-dependent dynamic interaction with the\nsubstrate leads to a complex and dramatic change in the carrier type and\ndensity that is relevant for transport.

However, existing techniques are\ncomputationally expensive and may result in degenerate solutions that degrade\nclustering performance in the case of insufficient data sampling. To partially\nsolve these problems, and inspired by existing work on matrix factorization,\nthis paper proposes fixed-rank representation (FRR) as a unified framework for\nunsupervised visual learning. FRR is able to reveal the structure of multiple\nsubspaces in closed-form when the data is noiseless.

In this paper, we extend this operation to formal power\nseries and systemically investigate its implications in the study of weighted\nautomata. In particular, we define two quotient operations for formal power\nseries that coincide when calculated by a word. We term the first operation as\n(left or right) \\emph{quotient}, and the second as (left or right)\n\\emph{residual}. To support the definitions of quotients and residuals, the\nunderlying semiring is restricted to complete semirings or complete\nc-semirings. Algebraical properties that are similar to the classical case are\nobtained in the formal power series case. Moreover, we show closure properties,\nunder quotients and residuals, of regular series and weighted context-free\nseries are similar as in formal languages.

We demonstrate that this long-term stock\nmarket rhythm moves in lockstep with corresponding long-term economic, social,\nand political rhythms in the US. Assuming that the past relationship between\nthese rhythms will hold unaltered in the future, we provide the medium to\nlong-term stock market outlook.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2012 14:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 14:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-01"}

The\nonly empirically adjustable parameter of the model, the injection-point\ndistance (sinj), has been determined individually for all the reactions and\nvery regular systematics of this parameter have been established. The\nregularity of the obtained sinj systematics indirectly points at the internal\nconsistency of the whole set of fission barriers used in the calculations.\nHaving fitted all the experimental excitation functions for elements Z =\n114-118, the FBD model (with the new sinj systematics) was used to predict\ncross sections for synthesis of elements Z = 119 and 120. Regarding prospects\nto produce the new element Z = 119, our calculations prefer the\n252Es(48Ca,xn)300-x119 reaction, for which the synthesis cross section of about\n0.2 pb in 4n channel at Ec.m.= 220 MeV is expected. The most favorable reaction\nto synthesize the element Z = 120 turns out to be 249Cf(50Ti,xn)299-x120, but\nthe predicted cross section for this reaction is only 6 fb (for 3n and 4n\nchannels).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Mar 2012 15:04:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 20:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
