In our\nmodel, a fraction $p$ of an available resource is deployed in a centralized\nmanner (e.g., to serve a most-loaded station) while the remaining fraction\n$1-p$ is allocated to local servers that can only serve requests addressed\nspecifically to their respective stations.\n  Using a fluid model approach, we demonstrate a surprising phase transition in\nthe steady-state delay, as $p$ changes: in the limit of a large number of\nstations, and when any amount of centralization is available ($p>0$), the\naverage queue length in steady state scales as $\\log_{1/(1-p)} 1/(1-\\lambda)$\nwhen the traffic intensity $\\lambda$ goes to 1. This is exponentially smaller\nthan the usual M/M/1-queue delay scaling of $1/(1-\\lambda)$, obtained when all\nresources are fully allocated to local stations ($p=0$). This indicates a\nstrong qualitative impact of even a small degree of centralization.\n  We prove convergence to a fluid limit, and characterize both the transient\nand steady-state behavior of the finite system, in the limit as the number of\nstations $N$ goes to infinity. We show that the sequence of queue-length\nprocesses converges to a unique fluid trajectory (over any finite time\ninterval, as $N$ approaches infinity, and that this fluid trajectory converges\nto a unique invariant state $v^I$, for which a simple closed-form expression is\nobtained. We also show that the steady-state distribution of the $N$-server\nsystem concentrates on $v^I$ as $N$ goes to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 16:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-23"}

An important question is how the circumstellar envelopes of\nAGB stars switch from spherical symmetry to the axially symmetric structures\nfrequently observed in PNe. In many cases there is clear evidence that the\nshaping of the circumstellar envelopes of PNe is linked to the formation of\njets/collimated winds and their interaction with the remnant AGB envelope.\nBecause of the short evolutionary time, objects in this phase are rare, but\ntheir identification provides valuable probes for testing evolutionary models.\nWe have observed (sub)millimeter CO rotational transitions with the APEX\ntelescope in a small sample of stars hosting high-velocity OH and water masers.\nThese targets are supposed to have recently left the AGB, as indicated by the\npresence of winds traced by masers, with velocities larger than observed during\nthat phase.

Multitransition CO observations of galaxy centers have revealed that\nsignificant fractions of the dense circumnuclear gas have high kinetic\ntemperatures, which are hard to explain by pure photon excitation, but may be\ncaused by dissipation of turbulent energy.\n  Aims. We aim to determine to what extent mechanical heating should be taken\ninto account while modelling PDRs. To this end, the effect of dissipated\nturbulence on the thermal and chemical properties of PDRs is explored. Methods.\nClouds are modelled as 1D semi-infinite slabs whose thermal and chemical\nequilibrium is solved for using the Leiden PDR-XDR code.\n  Results. In a steady-state treatment, mechanical heating seems to play an\nimportant role in determining the kinetic temperature of the gas in molecular\nclouds. Particularly in high-energy environments such as starburst galaxies and\ngalaxy centers, model gas temperatures are underestimated by at least a factor\nof two if mechanical heating is ignored. The models also show that CO, HCN and\nH2 O column densities increase as a function of mechanical heating. The HNC/HCN\nintegrated column density ratio shows a decrease by a factor of at least two in\nhigh density regions with n \\sim 105 cm-3, whereas that of HCN/HCO+ shows a\nstrong dependence on mechanical heating for this same density range, with\nboosts of up to three orders of magnitude.\n  Conclusions.

Its principle relies on the combination of spatial\nfiltering and aperture masking using single-mode fibers, a novel technique that\nis aimed at high dynamic range imaging with high angular resolution. The\nprototype has been tested with the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick Observatory. The\nentrance pupil is divided into subpupils feeding single-mode fibers. The flux\ninjection into the fibers is optimized by a segmented mirror. The beams are\nspectrally dispersed and recombined in a non-redundant exit configuration in\norder to retrieve all contrasts and phases independently. The instrument works\nat visible wavelengths between 600 nm and 760 nm and currently uses nine of the\n30 43 cm subapertures constituting the full pupil. First fringes were obtained\non Vega and Deneb. Stable closure phases were measured with standard deviations\non the order of 1 degree. Closure phase precision can be further improved by\naddressing some of the remaining sources of systematic errors. While the number\nof fibers used in the experiment was too small to reliably estimate visibility\namplitudes, we have measured closure amplitudes with a precision of 10 % in the\nbest case. These first promising results obtained under real observing\nconditions validate the concept of the fibered aperture masking instrument and\nopen the way for a new type of ground-based instrument working in the visible.\nThe next steps of the development will be to improve the stability and the\nsensitivity of the instrument in order to achieve more accurate closure phase\nand visibility measurements, and to increase the number of sub-pupils to reach\nfull pupil coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 18:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This is less\nobvious for engineering networks (electric power, gas, water, transportation\nsystems etc.) that are expected to operate under normal conditions most of\ntime. As a result, the ability of a network to withstand massive sudden damage\ncaused by adverse events (or survivability) has not been among traditional\ngoals in the network design. Reality, however, calls for the adjustment of\ndesign priorities. As modern networks develop toward increasing their size,\ncomplexity, and integration, the likelihood of adverse events increases too due\nto technological development, climate change, and activities in the political\narena among other factors. Under such circumstances, a network failure has an\nunprecedented effect on lives and economy. To mitigate the impact of adverse\nevents on the network operability, the survivability analysis must be conducted\nat the early stage of the network design. Such analysis requires the\ndevelopment of new analytical and computational tools. Computational analysis\nof the network survivability is the exponential time problem at least. The\ncurrent paper describes a new algorithm, in which the reduction of the\ncomputational complexity is achieved by mapping an initial network topology\nwith multiple sources and sinks onto a set of simpler smaller topologies with\nmultiple sources and a single sink. Steps for further reducing the time and\nspace expenses of computations are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 19:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

Here we show that\nterrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high\nenough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long enough duration for all\nthe hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and\ncannot support life. We call these planets \"Tidal Venuses,\" and the phenomenon\na \"tidal greenhouse.\" Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases\ntidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its\naccompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle\ninto nearly circular orbits (i.e. with negligible tidal heating) in the\nhabitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable as past tidal\nheating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed\nfollow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. Planets orbiting stars\nwith masses <0.3 solar masses may be in danger of desiccation via tidal\nheating. We apply these concepts to Gl 667C c, a ~4.5 Earth-mass planet\norbiting a 0.3 solar mass star at 0.12 AU.

While\nbilinear random effect models (matrix factorization) provide state-of-the-art\nperformance when minimizing RMSE through a Gaussian response model on explicit\nratings data, applying it to imbalanced binary response data presents\nadditional challenges that we carefully study in this paper. Data in many\napplications usually consist of users' implicit response that are often binary\n-- clicking an item or not; the goal is to predict click rates, which is often\ncombined with other measures to calculate utilities to rank items at runtime of\nthe recommender systems. Because of the implicit nature, such data are usually\nmuch larger than explicit rating data and often have an imbalanced distribution\nwith a small fraction of click events, making accurate click rate prediction\ndifficult. In this paper, we address two problems. First, we show previous\ntechniques to estimate bilinear random effect models with binary data are less\naccurate compared to our new approach based on adaptive rejection sampling,\nespecially for imbalanced response. Second, we develop a parallel bilinear\nrandom effect model fitting framework using Map-Reduce paradigm that scales to\nmassive datasets.

Current\nmethods for finding communities in a single snapshot are not straightforwardly\ngeneralizable to finding temporal communities since the quality functions used\nfor finding static communities have highly degenerate landscapes, and the\neventual partition chosen among the many partitions of similar quality is\nhighly sensitive to small changes in the network. To reliably detect temporal\ncommunities we need not only to find a good community partition in a given\nsnapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s)\nfound in immediately preceding snapshots.

A fast implementation of the bilateral filter was recently proposed in\n[2] that required O(1) operations per pixel with respect to \\sigma_s. This was\ndone by using trigonometric functions for the range kernel of the bilateral\nfilter, and by exploiting their so-called shiftability property. In particular,\na fast implementation of the Gaussian bilateral filter was realized by\napproximating the Gaussian range kernel using raised cosines. Later, it was\ndemonstrated in [3] that this idea could be extended to a larger class of\nfilters, including the popular non-local means filter [4]. As already observed\nin [2], a flip side of this approach was that the run time depended on the\nwidth \\sigma_r of the range kernel. For an image with (local) intensity\nvariations in the range [0,T], the run time scaled as O(T^2/\\sigma^2_r) with\n\\sigma_r. This made it difficult to implement narrow range kernels,\nparticularly for images with large dynamic range.

Several\n{numerical simulations with} helical and non-helical forcing functions are\nconsidered in periodic boxes with unit aspect ratio.

In the chiral theory, we explore\nperturbative unitarity violation as a function of the number of colors and the\nnumber of flavors, holding the scale of the \"new physics\" (i.e. QCD) fixed.\nThis demonstrates that the onset of new physics is parametrically uncorrelated\nwith tree-unitarity violation.

As a\nresult, all (equilibrium) dynamical models are divided into three major\ncategories: Markovian models with unbroken Q-symmetry, chaotic models with\nQ-symmetry spontaneously broken on the mean-field level by, e.g., fractal\ninvariant sets (e.g., strange attractors), and intermittent or self-organized\ncritical (SOC) models with Q-symmetry dynamically broken by the condensation of\ninstanton-antiinstanton configurations (earthquakes, avalanches etc.) SOC is a\nfull-dimensional phase separating chaos and Markovian dynamics.

Chaos\nreveals itself in spectral properties of the finite-range evolution operator\n(FREO). FREO describes transformation of a wavefield in course of propagation\nalong a finite segment of a waveguide. We study transition to chaos by tracking\nvariations in spectral statistics with increasing length of the segment.\nAnalysis of the FREO is accompanied with ray calculations using the one-step\nPoincar\\'e map which is the classical counterpart of the FREO. Underwater sound\nchannel in the Sea of Japan is taken for an example. Several methods of\nspectral analysis are utilized. In particular, we approximate level spacing\nstatistics by means of the Berry-Robnik and Brody distributions, explore the\nspectrum using the procedure elaborated by A.

This phenomenon is\nassociated with the presence of a shearless torus in the classical phase space.\nIncreasing of acoustic wavelength degrades scattering, resulting in recovery of\nlocalization near periodic orbits of the one-step Poincar\\'e map.

Mixture models are traditionally learned using the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) soft clustering technique that monotonically\nincreases the incomplete (expected complete) likelihood. Given prescribed\nmixture weights, the hard clustering $k$-MLE algorithm iteratively assigns data\nto the most likely weighted component and update the component models using\nMaximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs). Using the duality between exponential\nfamilies and Bregman divergences, we prove that the local convergence of the\ncomplete likelihood of $k$-MLE follows directly from the convergence of a dual\nadditively weighted Bregman hard clustering. The inner loop of $k$-MLE can be\nimplemented using any $k$-means heuristic like the celebrated Lloyd's batched\nor Hartigan's greedy swap updates. We then show how to update the mixture\nweights by minimizing a cross-entropy criterion that implies to update weights\nby taking the relative proportion of cluster points, and reiterate the mixture\nparameter update and mixture weight update processes until convergence. Hard EM\nis interpreted as a special case of $k$-MLE when both the component update and\nthe weight update are performed successively in the inner loop. To initialize\n$k$-MLE, we propose $k$-MLE++, a careful initialization of $k$-MLE guaranteeing\nprobabilistically a global bound on the best possible complete likelihood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 06:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The closure\nphases indicate relatively small deviations from point symmetry close to the\nphotospheric layer, and stronger deviations in the extended H2O and CO layers.\nMaking use of the high spatial and spectral resolution, a near-continuum\nbandpass can be isolated from contamination by molecular and dusty layers, and\nthe Rosseland-mean photospheric angular diameter is estimated to 11.3 +/- 0.3\nmas based on a PHOENIX atmosphere model. Together with recent high-precision\nestimates of the distance and spectro-photometry, this estimate corresponds to\na radius of 1420 +/- 120 Rsun and an effective temperature of 3490 +/- 90 K. VY\nCMa exhibits asymmetric, possibly clumpy, atmospheric layers of H2O and CO,\nwhich are not co-spatial, within a larger elongated dusty envelope. Our revised\nfundamental parameters put VY CMa close to the Hayashi limit of recent\nevolutionary tracks of initial mass 25 Msun with rotation or 32 Msun without\nrotation, shortly before evolving blueward in the HR-diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 08:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-26"}

When we\nadd the visibilities of all channels, the foreground signals increase roughly\nby a factor of ~N because they are highly correlated. However, the 21 cm\nsignals increase by a factor of ~\\sqrt{N} because the signals in different\nchannels contribute randomly.

New regime\nof conduction in correlated 1D systems is predicted beyond the well-known\nregime of tunneling resulting in the power-law I-V-curves. In this regime a\nquantum wire becomes \"opened\" at voltage biases above the threshold value\n$V_T$, giving rise to a rapid increase of the dc current, $\\bar I$, accompanied\nby ac oscillations of frequency $f = \\bar I/e$. The effect of ac generation is\nrelated to sliding of the Friedel oscillations of electronic density produced\nby the defect. Manifestations of the effect resemble the Coulomb blockade and\nthe Josephson effect. The spin bias applied to the system is shown to affect\nthe I-V curves due to violation of the spin-charge separation at the defect\nsite.

We resolve this \"metric ambiguity\" by\nan investigation of the most general form of the quantum effective action for\nseveral metrics. In the long-distance limit the physical metric is universal\nand accounts for a massless graviton. Other degrees of freedom contained in the\nvarious metric candidates describe very massive scalars and symmetric second\nrank tensors. They only play a role at microscopic distances, typically around\nthe Planck length. The universality of geometry at long distances extends to\nthe vierbein and the connection. On the other hand, for distances and time\nintervals of Planck size geometry looses its universal meaning. Time is born\nwith the big bang.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 11:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A desirable property for any BQC protocol is\nverification, whereby the client can verify with high probability whether the\nserver has followed the instructions of the protocol, or if there has been some\ndeviation resulting in a corrupted output state. A verifiable BQC protocol can\nbe viewed as an interactive proof system leading to consequences for complexity\ntheory. The authors, together with Broadbent, previously proposed a universal\nand unconditionally secure BQC scheme where the client only needs to be able to\nprepare single qubits in separable states randomly chosen from a finite set and\nsend them to the server, who has the balance of the required quantum\ncomputational resources. In this paper we extend that protocol with new\nfunctionality allowing blind computational basis measurements, which we use to\nconstruct a new verifiable BQC protocol based on a new class of resource\nstates. We rigorously prove that the probability of failing to detect an\nincorrect output is exponentially small in a security parameter, while resource\noverhead remains polynomial in this parameter. The new resource state allows\nentangling gates to be performed between arbitrary pairs of logical qubits with\nonly constant overhead. This is a significant improvement on the original\nscheme, which required that all computations to be performed must first be put\ninto a nearest neighbour form, incurring linear overhead in the number of\nqubits. Such an improvement has important consequences for efficiency and\nfault-tolerance thresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 11:46:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 09:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 12:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

For instance, flows of pedestrians\nmoving in opposite directions spontaneously segregate into lanes of uniform\nwalking directions. This phenomenon is often referred to as a smart collective\npattern, as it increases the traffic efficiency with no need of external\ncontrol. However, the functional benefits of this emergent organization have\nnever been experimentally measured, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms\nare poorly understood. In this work, we have studied this phenomenon under\ncontrolled laboratory conditions. We found that the traffic segregation\nexhibits structural instabilities characterized by the alternation of organized\nand disorganized states, where the lifetime of well-organized clusters of\npedestrians follow a stretched exponential relaxation process. Further analysis\nshow that the inter-pedestrian variability of comfortable walking speeds is a\nkey variable at the origin of the observed traffic perturbations. We show that\nthe collective benefit of the emerging pattern is maximized when all\npedestrians walk at the average speed of the group. In practice, however, local\ninteractions between slow- and fast-walking pedestrians trigger global\nbreakdowns of organization, which reduce the collective and the individual\npayoff provided by the traffic segregation. This work is a step ahead toward\nthe understanding of traffic self-organization in crowds, which turns out to be\nmodulated by complex behavioral mechanisms that do not always maximize the\ngroup's benefits. The quantitative understanding of crowd behaviors opens the\nway for designing bottom-up management strategies bound to promote the\nemergence of efficient collective behaviors in crowds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 15:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-26"}

In particular, we observed an inverse \"order-to-disorder\"\ntransition, and a re-entrant transition, with dependence on the specific type\nof bounded noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 15:29:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 17:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

These\nbrightening events, associated with a color change toward the blue, should\noriginate from an increased accretion activity. Moreover, the star also\nunderwent a brightness drop of ~1 mag lasting for about a month, during which\nthe star became bluer when fainter. Such brightness drops seem to have a\nrecurrence time scale of a year, as evidenced in our data and the photometric\nbehavior of GM Cep over a century. Between consecutive drops, the star\nbrightened gradually by about 1 mag and became blue at peak luminosity. We\npropose that the drop is caused by obscuration of the central star by an\norbiting dust concentration. The UX Orionis type of activity in GM Cep\ntherefore exemplifies the disk inhomogeneity process in transition between\ngrain coagulation and planetesimal formation in a young circumstellar disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 15:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-21"}
