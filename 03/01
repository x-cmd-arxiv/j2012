In a proton run with the LHC 7-TeV beam, one can analyze pp, pd and pA\ncollisions at sqrt(s_NN)~115 GeV and even higher using the Fermi motion in a\nnuclear target. In a Pb run with a 2.76 TeV-per-nucleon beam, sqrt(s_NN) is as\nhigh as 72 GeV. Bent crystals can be used to extract about 5x10^8 protons/s;\nthe integrated luminosity over a year reaches 0.5fb-1 on a typical 1 cm-long\ntarget without species limitation. Such an extraction mode does not alter the\nperformance of the collider experiments at the LHC. By instrumenting the\ntarget-rapidity region, gluon and heavy-quark proton and neutron PDFs can be\naccessed at large x and even at x larger than 1 in the nuclear case. Single\ndiffractive physics and, for the first time, the large negative-xF domain can\nbe accessed. The nuclear target-species versatility provides a unique\nopportunity to study nuclear matter vs. the features of the hot and dense\nmatter formed in heavy-ion collisions, which can be studied in PbA collisions\nover the full range of target-rapidity domain with a large variety of nuclei.\nThe polarization of hydrogen and nuclear targets allows an ambitious spin\nprogram, including measurements of the QCD lensing effects which underlie the\nSivers single-spin asymmetry, the study of transversity distributions and\npossibly of polarized PDFs. We also emphasize the potential offered by pA\nultra-peripheral collisions where the nucleus target A is used as a coherent\nphoton source, mimicking photoproduction processes in ep collisions. Finally,\nwe note that W and Z bosons can be produced and detected in a fixed-target\nexperiment and in their threshold domain for the first time, providing new ways\nto probe the partonic content of the proton and the nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 16:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This is an interesting proposal. However, there\nare serious problems with their analysis that need to be pointed out. Perhaps\nthe most important of these is the fact that for principal quantum numbers\nbelow n = 200, where the widths are not in question, their processed generated\nprofile widths do not fit the widths of the processed lines obtained at the\ntelescope. After processing, the halfwidths of the generated and telescope\nprofiles must agree below n = 200 if we are to believe that the processed\ngenerated linewidths above n = 200 are meaningful. Theirs do not. Furthermore,\nwe find that after applying the linewidth reduction factors found by Alexander\nand Gulyaev for their noise added profiles to our generated profiles to\nsimulate their noise adding effect, the processed widths we obtain still do not\ncome close to explaining the narrowing seen in the telescope lines for n values\nin the range 200 < n < 250.

On large scales the Universe\ndisplays coherent structure, with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on\nscales of ~1-3 Mpc/h, which lie at the intersections of long filaments of\ngalaxies that are >10 Mpc/h in length. Vast regions of relatively empty space,\nknown as voids, contain very few galaxies and span the volume in between these\nstructures. This observed large scale structure depends both on cosmological\nparameters and on the formation and evolution of galaxies. Using the two-point\ncorrelation function, one can trace the dependence of large scale structure on\ngalaxy properties such as luminosity, color, stellar mass, and track its\nevolution with redshift. Comparison of the observed galaxy clustering\nsignatures with dark matter simulations allows one to model and understand the\nclustering of galaxies and their formation and evolution within their parent\ndark matter halos. Clustering measurements can determine the parent dark matter\nhalo mass of a given galaxy population, connect observed galaxy populations at\ndifferent epochs, and constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy evolution\nmodels. This chapter describes the methods used to measure the two-point\ncorrelation function in both redshift and real space, presents the current\nresults of how the clustering amplitude depends on various galaxy properties,\nand discusses quantitative measurements of the structures of voids and\nfilaments.

Each\ntransmitter has an individual message for its paired receiver, and\nadditionally, both transmitters have a common message to deliver to both\nreceivers. In this paper, through explicit inner and outer bounds on the\ncapacity region, we establish the capacity region of the Gaussian IC-CI to\nwithin a bounded gap of one bit, independently of the values of all channel\nparameters. Using this constant-gap characterization, the generalized degrees\nof freedom (GDoF) region is determined. It is shown that the introduction of\nthe common message leads to an increase in the GDoF over that achievable over\nthe Gaussian interference channel without a common message, and hence to an\nunbounded improvement in the achievable rate. A surprising feature of the\ncapacity-within-one-bit result is that most of the available benefit (i.e., to\nwithin one bit of capacity) due to the common message is achieved through a\nsimple and explicit coding scheme that involves independent signaling at the\ntwo transmitters so that, in effect, this scheme forgoes the opportunity for\ntransmitter cooperation that is inherently available due to shared knowledge of\nthe common message at both transmitters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 19:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-01"}

(Here log^(2) i =\nlog log i.) Following Elena Kalinina (Kalinina 2011), we provide a simple\ngame-based proof of this result; modifying her argument, we get a better (and\ntight) bound log n - O(1). We also show the same bound for prefix-free\ncomplexity.\n  Robert Solovay showed (Solovay 1975) that infinitely many strings x have\nmaximal plain complexity but not maximal prefix complexity (among the strings\nof the same length): for some c there exist infinitely many x such that |x| -\nC(x) < c and |x| + K(|x|) - K(x) > log^(2) |x| - c log^(3) |x|.

Log sharing can be extremely valuable for\nadvertising, data mining research and network management, but it poses a\nserious threat to the privacy of LBS users. Sender anonymity solutions prevent\na malicious attacker from inferring the interests of LBS users by associating\nthem with their service requests after gaining access to the anonymized logs.\nWith the fast-increasing adoption of smartphones and the concern that historic\nuser trajectories are becoming more accessible, it becomes necessary for any\nsender anonymity solution to protect against attackers that are\ntrajectory-aware (i.e. have access to historic user trajectories) as well as\npolicy-aware (i.e they know the log anonymization policy). We call such\nattackers TP-aware.\n  This paper introduces a first privacy guarantee against TP-aware attackers,\ncalled TP-aware sender k-anonymity. It turns out that there are many possible\nTP-aware anonymizations for the same LBS log, each with a different utility to\nthe consumer of the anonymized log. The problem of finding the optimal TP-aware\nanonymization is investigated. We show that trajectory-awareness renders the\nproblem computationally harder than the trajectory-unaware variants found in\nthe literature (NP-complete in the size of the log, versus PTIME). We describe\na PTIME l-approximation algorithm for trajectories of length l and empirically\nshow that it scales to large LBS logs (up to 2 million users).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 20:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

We present results as a function of the\nluminosity, stellar mass and colour of the satellites, and of the stellar mass\nand colour of the primaries. For massive primaries the luminosity and stellar\nmass functions of satellites are similar in shape to those of field galaxies,\nbut for lower mass primaries they are significantly steeper. The steepening is\nparticularly marked for the stellar mass function. Satellite abundance\nincreases strongly with primary stellar mass, approximately in proportion to\nexpected dark halo mass. Massive red primaries have up to a factor of 2 more\nsatellites than blue ones of the same stellar mass. Satellite galaxies are\nsystematically redder than field galaxies of the same stellar mass. Satellites\nare also systematically redder around more massive primaries. At fixed primary\nmass, they are redder around red primaries. We select similarly isolated\ngalaxies from mock catalogues based on the simulations of Guo et al.(2011) and\nanalyze them in parallel with the SDSS data. The simulation reproduces all the\nabove trends qualitatively, except for the steepening of the satellite\nluminosity and stellar mass functions.

Simulated haloes of a given mass have satellite abundances\nthat are independent of central galaxy colour, but red centrals tend to have\nlower stellar masses, reflecting earlier quenching of their star formation by\nfeedback. This explains the correlation between satellite abundance and primary\ncolour in the simulation. The correlation between satellite colour and primary\ncolour arises because red centrals live in haloes which are more massive, older\nand more gas-rich, so that satellite quenching is more efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 21:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 12:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-01"}

Here I examine\nthe influence of initial asymmetry on the final breakup by simulating the\nbubble surface evolution as a Hamiltonian evolution corresponding to an\ninviscid, two-dimensional, planar implosion. I find two types of breakups: a\npreviously reported coalescence mode in which distant regions along the\nair-water surface curve inwards and eventually collide with finite speed, and a\nhitherto unknown cusp-like mode in which the surface develops sharp tips whose\nradii of curvature are much smaller than the average neck radius. I present\nthree sets of results that characterize the nature of this cusp mode. First, I\nshow that the cusp mode corresponds to a saddle-node. In other words, an\nevolution towards a cross-section shape with sharp tips invariably later\nevolves away from it. In phase space, this saddle-node separates coalescence\nmodes whose coalescence planes lie along different spatial orientations.\nSecond, I show that the formation of the sharp tips can be interpreted as a\nweakly first-order transition which becomes second-order, corresponding to the\nformation of a finite-time curvature singularity, in the limit that the initial\nperturbation amplitude approaches zero. Third I show that, as the curvature\nsingularity is approached, the maximum surface curvature diverges approximately\nas $(t_c - t)^{-0.8}$, where $t_c$ is the onset time of the singularity and the\nmaximum velocity diverges approximately as $(t_c-t)^{-0.4}$. In practice, these\ndivergences imply that viscous drag and compressibility of the gas flow, two\neffects not included in my analysis, become significant as the interface\nevolves towards the curvature singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 21:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this paper we\nstudy verification of (first-order) mu-calculus variants over relational\ndata-centric dynamic systems, where data are represented by a full-fledged\nrelational database, and the process is described in terms of atomic actions\nthat evolve the database. The execution of such actions may involve calls to\nexternal services, providing fresh data inserted into the system. As a result\nsuch systems are typically infinite-state. We show that verification is\nundecidable in general, and we isolate notable cases, where decidability is\nachieved. Specifically we start by considering service calls that return values\ndeterministically (depending only on passed parameters). We show that in a\nmu-calculus variant that preserves knowledge of objects appeared along a run we\nget decidability under the assumption that the fresh data introduced along a\nrun are bounded, though they might not be bounded in the overall system. In\nfact we tie such a result to a notion related to weak acyclicity studied in\ndata exchange. Then, we move to nondeterministic services where the assumption\nof data bounded run would result in a bound on the service calls that can be\ninvoked during the execution and hence would be too restrictive. So we\ninvestigate decidability under the assumption that knowledge of objects is\npreserved only if they are continuously present. We show that if infinitely\nmany values occur in a run but do not accumulate in the same state, then we get\nagain decidability. We give syntactic conditions to avoid this accumulation\nthrough the novel notion of \"generate-recall acyclicity\", which takes into\nconsideration that every service call activation generates new values that\ncannot be accumulated indefinitely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 21:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

Under the\nstandard assumption of optically thin single temperature (T) sources the dust\nSED as represented by a power--law modified black body is subject to a strong\ndegeneracy between T and the spectral index beta. The traditional\nnon-hierarchical approaches, typically based on chi-square minimization, are\nseverely limited by this degeneracy, as it produces an artificial\nanti-correlation between T and beta even with modest levels of observational\nnoise. The hierarchical Bayesian method rigorously and self-consistently treats\nmeasurement uncertainties, including calibration and noise, resulting in more\nprecise SED fits. As a result, the Bayesian fits do not produce any spurious\nanti-correlations between the SED parameters due to measurement uncertainty. We\ndemonstrate that the Bayesian method is substantially more accurate than the\nchi-square fit in recovering the SED parameters, as well as the correlations\nbetween them.

We use a local state-based\nscheduler to select a few critical data packets to send to the MAC. In this\npaper, we analyze the impact of such a scheduler on the closed-loop system in\nthe presence of traffic, and show that there is a dual effect with state-based\nscheduling. In general, this makes the optimal scheduler and controller hard to\nfind. However, by removing past controls from the scheduling criterion, we find\nthat certainty equivalence holds. This condition is related to the classical\nresult of Bar-Shalom and Tse, and it leads to the design of a scheduler with a\ncertainty equivalent controller. This design, however, does not result in an\nequivalent system to the original problem, in the sense of Witsenhausen.\nComputing the estimate is difficult, but can be simplified by introducing a\nsymmetry constraint on the scheduler.

Such environments are characterized by two\nchallenging features: (a) they have little idle system time to devote on\nphysical design; and (b) there is little, if any, a priori workload knowledge,\nwhile the query and data workload keeps changing dynamically. In such\nenvironments, traditional approaches to index building and maintenance cannot\napply. Database cracking has been proposed as a solution that allows on-the-fly\nphysical data reorganization, as a collateral effect of query processing.\nCracking aims to continuously and automatically adapt indexes to the workload\nat hand, without human intervention. Indexes are built incrementally,\nadaptively, and on demand. Nevertheless, as we show, existing adaptive indexing\nmethods fail to deliver workload-robustness; they perform much better with\nrandom workloads than with others. This frailty derives from the inelasticity\nwith which these approaches interpret each query as a hint on how data should\nbe stored. Current cracking schemes blindly reorganize the data within each\nquery's range, even if that results into successive expensive operations with\nminimal indexing benefit. In this paper, we introduce stochastic cracking, a\nsignificantly more resilient approach to adaptive indexing. Stochastic cracking\nalso uses each query as a hint on how to reorganize data, but not blindly so;\nit gains resilience and avoids performance bottlenecks by deliberately applying\ncertain arbitrary choices in its decision-making. Thereby, we bring adaptive\nindexing forward to a mature formulation that confers the workload-robustness\nprevious approaches lacked. Our extensive experimental study verifies that\nstochastic cracking maintains the desired properties of original database\ncracking while at the same time it performs well with diverse realistic\nworkloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 00:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

Stories can be identified via groups of tightly-coupled\nreal-world entities, namely the people, locations, products, etc., that are\ninvolved in the story. The sheer scale, and rapid evolution of the data\ninvolved necessitate highly efficient techniques for identifying important\nstories at every point of time. The main challenge in real-time story\nidentification is the maintenance of dense subgraphs (corresponding to groups\nof tightly-coupled entities) under streaming edge weight updates (resulting\nfrom a stream of user-generated content). This is the first work to study the\nefficient maintenance of dense subgraphs under such streaming edge weight\nupdates. For a wide range of definitions of density, we derive theoretical\nresults regarding the magnitude of change that a single edge weight update can\ncause. Based on these, we propose a novel algorithm, DYNDENS, which outperforms\nadaptations of existing techniques to this setting, and yields meaningful\nresults. Our approach is validated by a thorough experimental evaluation on\nlarge-scale real and synthetic datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 00:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

This large scale data analysis is\nfacilitated by the MapReduce programming and execution model and its\nimplementations, most notably Hadoop. Users of MapReduce often have analysis\ntasks that are too complex to express as individual MapReduce jobs. Instead,\nthey use high-level query languages such as Pig, Hive, or Jaql to express their\ncomplex tasks. The compilers of these languages translate queries into\nworkflows of MapReduce jobs. Each job in these workflows reads its input from\nthe distributed file system used by the MapReduce system and produces output\nthat is stored in this distributed file system and read as input by the next\njob in the workflow. The current practice is to delete these intermediate\nresults from the distributed file system at the end of executing the workflow.\nOne way to improve the performance of workflows of MapReduce jobs is to keep\nthese intermediate results and reuse them for future workflows submitted to the\nsystem. In this paper, we present ReStore, a system that manages the storage\nand reuse of such intermediate results. ReStore can reuse the output of whole\nMapReduce jobs that are part of a workflow, and it can also create additional\nreuse opportunities by materializing and storing the output of query execution\noperators that are executed within a MapReduce job. We have implemented ReStore\nas an extension to the Pig dataflow system on top of Hadoop, and we\nexperimentally demonstrate significant speedups on queries from the PigMix\nbenchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 00:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

Cosmic muons and gamma rays traverse two synchronized scintillators\nconnected to two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) via light guides, and generate\nelectronic pulses which we counted using a Data Acquisition Board (DAQ).\nBecause muons are the product of collisions between high-energy cosmic rays and\natmospheric nuclei, and therefore shower onto earth, the scintillators were\narranged horizontally for detection. The elevation measurements were recorded\nat different locations, starting from 60 feet below sea-level at the\nUnderground Radiation Counting Laboratory at Johnson Space Center, TX, to 4200\nfeet at Mt. Hamilton, CA. Intermediate locations included sea-level Galveston\nBay, TX, and Mt. Magazine, AR (2800 feet). The data points showed a noticeable\nincrease in flux as elevation increases, independent of latitude. Measurements\ninvestigating the dependence of cosmic rays on temperature and time of the year\ntook place locally in Magnolia, AR. We found that cosmic muon flux is uniform,\nappears to be independent of conditions on earth, and is anti-correlative with\ntemperature. We are convinced that the sun has minimal to zero effect on\ncosmic-ray flux; it cannot be a major contributing source of this background\nradiation. The source of cosmic radiation remains one of the biggest unanswered\nquestions in physics today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 06:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

However, images\ntaken in different bands often look remarkably similar as each band receives\ncontributions coming from regions with a range of different temperatures. This\nhas motivated the search for empirical techniques that may unmix these\ncontributions and concentrate salient morphological features of the corona in a\nsmaller set of less redundant source images. Blind Source Separation (BSS)\nprecisely does this. Here we show how this novel concept also provides new\ninsight into the physics of the solar corona, using observations made by\nSDO/AIA. The source images are extracted using a Bayesian positive source\nseparation technique. We show how observations made in six spectral bands,\ncorresponding to optically thin emissions, can be reconstructed by linear\ncombination of three sources. These sources have a narrower temperature\nresponse and allow for considerable data reduction since the pertinent\ninformation from all six bands can be condensed in only one single composite\npicture. In addition, they give access to empirical temperature maps of the\ncorona.

In photosynthesis, the light photon is absorbed to\ncreate an exciton in the antenna complex of the photosynthetic pigments. This\nexciton then migrates along the chain-biomolecules, like FMO complex, to the\nreaction centre where it initiates the chemical reactions leading to biomass\ngeneration. Recently, it has been experimentally observed that the exciton\nmotion is highly quantum mechanical in nature i.e., it involve long time ($\\sim\n600$ femto sec) quantum coherence effects.

The Product Space is a network connecting products that tend to be\nexported by the same sets of countries. Since countries are more likely to\ndevelop products that are close by in the Product Space to the ones that they\nalready produce, the Product Space can be used to help anticipate a country's\nindustrial opportunities.\n  Our results suggest that the most natural avenue for future product\ndiversification for these five south-east African nations resides in the\nagricultural sector, since all of these nations appear to have productive\nstructures that are pre-adapted to the production of many agricultural products\nthat none of them are currently exporting.\n  We conclude this paper by exploring the potential benefits of further\nregional economic integration by doing an exercise in which we pull together\nthe productive structures of these five countries. This exercise shows that the\nproducts that become more accessible in the combined economy are once again\npredominantly agricultural.

In the case p=1/2, we find that such a bridge\ntypically goes a distance of order t (in the sense of graph distance) from the\ninitial state. For the asymmetric systems, we note an interesting duality which\nshows that bridges with parameters p and 1-p have the same distribution; the\nmaximal distance of the process from the original state behaves like c(p)log(t)\nfor some constant c(p) depending on p.

More specifically, it focuses on\nrepresentations and applications of string diagrams. String diagrams are used\nto represent a collection of processes, depicted as \"boxes\" with multiple\n(typed) inputs and outputs, depicted as \"wires\". If we allow plugging input and\noutput wires together, we can intuitively represent complex compositions of\nprocesses, formalised as morphisms in a monoidal category.\n  [...] The first major contribution of this dissertation is the introduction\nof a discretised version of a string diagram called a string graph. String\ngraphs form a partial adhesive category, so they can be manipulated using\ndouble-pushout graph rewriting. Furthermore, we show how string graphs modulo a\nrewrite system can be used to construct free symmetric traced and compact\nclosed categories on a monoidal signature.\n  The second contribution is in the application of graphical languages to\nquantum information theory. We use a mixture of diagrammatic and algebraic\ntechniques to prove a new classification result for strongly complementary\nobservables.

We introduce error-correcting output codes (ECOCs) in\nthis setting and propose two new methods for reducing complexity when using\nrollouts-based approaches. The first method consists in using an ECOC-based\nclassifier as the multiclass classifier, reducing the learning complexity from\nO(A2) to O(Alog(A)). We then propose a novel method that profits from the\nECOC's coding dictionary to split the initial MDP into O(log(A)) seperate\ntwo-action MDPs. This second method reduces learning complexity even further,\nfrom O(A2) to O(log(A)), thus rendering problems with large action sets\ntractable.

The tracking performance of SGV is shown to\nreproduce very closely that of the full simulation and reconstruction of the\nILD concept.

A similar theorem was claimed by Elkin and Peleg\n[ICALP 2000], but their proof was later found to have a fundamental error.

They are equivalent to the LTAD-models, but not to the PO\nequation of motion.\n  To resolve the conceptual controversy surrounding the relativistic\nLorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation, we interpret this equation as an asymptotic\ndifferential equation about the LTAD of an electrified PO, and not as a\ndifferential equation of motion for an electrified PO.\n  Keywords: Point-like; asymptotic dynamics; cyclic motion; differential\nequation; Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 12:48:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 12:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2012 16:01:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 19:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 18:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-28"}

The\nmemristor is the fourth and last such circuit element and thus completes\ncircuit theory. Predicted already in 1971, the eventual discovery of something\nseemingly so basic needed almost 40 years. However, this discovery is doubted.\nThe predicted memristor has no material memory and is based on magnetic flux,\nbut the discovered devices constitute analogue memory storage that do not\ninvolve magnetism. The person who originally proposed the memristor did not\nreject the discovery but instead changed his mind about what a memristor is. We\nbriefly introduce the history and then carefully memristance and the memristor\nas such. We discuss its status as a model rather than a device. We discuss the\ndiscovered devices, their stability, and how stability relates to the\nconsistency of the theoretical entities. A thought experiment assumes a world\nwithout magnetism. Inductors cannot exist there, but memory resistors could\nstill be constructed. On the same grounds as the memristor was historically\npredicted, an \"inductor\" could then be predicted. Likely, somebody would also\n'discover' one. A tentative sociological analysis compares to the flawed\ndetection of gravitational waves but comes to very different conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2012 04:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-08"}
