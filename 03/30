In reality, this\nboundary is not well-defined: thermal heating from the star in a passive disk\nyields a transition radius close to the star (<0.1 au), whereas if the disk is\nalready MRI active, it can self-consistently maintain the requisite\ntemperatures out to a transition radius of roughly 1 au. Moreover, the\ninterface may not be static; it may be highly fluctuating or else unstable. In\nthis paper, we study a reduced model of the dynamics of the active/dead zone\ninterface that mimics several important aspects of a real disk system. We find\nthat MRI-transition fronts propagate inward (a `dead front' suppressing the\nMRI) if they are initially at the larger transition radius, or propagate\noutward (an `active front' igniting the MRI) if starting from the smaller\ntransition radius. In both cases, the front stalls at a well-defined\nintermediate radius, where it remains in a quasi-static equilibrium. We propose\nthat it is this new, intermediate stalling radius that functions as the true\nboundary between the active and dead zones in protoplanetary disks.

More importantly, we emphasize\nthat the dark matter component of the leading tidal arm of the Sagittarius\ndwarf is significantly more extended than the stellar component of the arm,\nsince the dark matter and stellar streams are not necessarily coaxial and may\nbe offset by several kpc at the point at which they impact the Galactic disk.\nThis suggests that the dark matter component of the Sagittarius debris is\nlikely to have a non-negligible influence on dark matter detection experiments\neven when the stellar debris is centered several kpc from the solar\nneighborhood. Relative to models without an infalling Sagittarius dwarf, the\nSagittarius dark matter debris in our models induces an energy-dependent\nenhancement of direct search event rates of as much as ~20 - 45%, an\nenergy-dependent reduction in the amplitude of the annual modulation of the\nevent rate by as much as a factor of two, a shift in the phase of the annual\nmodulation by as much as ~20 days, and a shift in the recoil energy at which\nthe modulation reverses phase.

In\nthis paper we prove that the zeta correlation function is time-independent at\none-loop level in single clock inflation. While many of the one-loop diagrams\nlead to a time-dependence when considered individually, the time-dependence\nbeautifully cancels out in the overall sum. We identify two subsets of diagrams\nthat cancel separately due to different physical reasons. The first\ncancellation is related to the change of the background cosmology due to the\nrenormalization of the stress tensor. It results in a cancellation between the\nnon-1PI diagrams and some of the diagrams made with quartic vertices. The\nsecond subset of diagrams that cancel is made up of cubic operators, plus the\nremaining quartic ones. We are able to write the sum of these diagrams as the\nintegral over a specific three-point function between two very short\nwavelengths and one very long one. We then apply the consistency condition for\nthis three-point function in the squeezed limit to show that the sum of these\ndiagrams cannot give rise to a time dependence.

The model is embedded in an anisotropic type\nIIB compactification with two exponentially large extra dimensions and\nTeV-scale gravity. The bulk turns out to be nearly supersymmetric since the\nscale of the gravitino mass is of the order of the observed value of the\ncosmological constant. The quintessence field is a modulus parameterising the\nsize of an internal four-cycle which naturally develops a potential of the\norder (gravitino mass)^4, leading to a small dark energy scale without tunings.\nThe mass of the quintessence field is also radiatively stable since it is\nprotected by supersymmetry in the bulk. Moreover, this light scalar couples to\nordinary matter via its mixing with the volume mode. Due to the fact that the\nquintessence field is a flat direction at leading order, this mixing is very\nsmall, resulting in a suppressed coupling to Standard Model particles which\navoids stringent fifth-force constraints. On the other hand, if dark matter is\nrealised in terms of Kaluza-Klein states, unsuppressed couplings between dark\nenergy and dark matter can emerge, leading to a scenario of coupled\nquintessence within string theory. We study the dynamics of quintessence in our\nset-up, showing that its main features make it compatible with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 20:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Such problems are online problems. A common\nmethod of solving online problems is to first solve the corresponding linear\nprogram, and then round the fractional solution online to obtain an integral\nsolution.\n  We give algorithms for solving linear programs with mixed packing and\ncovering constraints online. We first consider mixed packing and covering\nlinear programs, where packing constraints are given offline and covering\nconstraints are received online. The objective is to minimize the maximum\nmultiplicative factor by which any packing constraint is violated, while\nsatisfying the covering constraints. No prior sublinear competitive algorithms\nare known for this problem. We give the first such --- a\npolylogarithmic-competitive algorithm for solving mixed packing and covering\nlinear programs online. We also show a nearly tight lower bound.\n  Our techniques for the upper bound use an exponential penalty function in\nconjunction with multiplicative updates. While exponential penalty functions\nare used previously to solve linear programs offline approximately, offline\nalgorithms know the constraints beforehand and can optimize greedily. In\ncontrast, when constraints arrive online, updates need to be more complex.\n  We apply our techniques to solve two online fixed-charge problems with\ncongestion. These problems are motivated by applications in machine scheduling\nand facility location. The linear program for these problems is more\ncomplicated than mixed packing and covering, and presents unique challenges. We\nshow that our techniques combined with a randomized rounding procedure give\npolylogarithmic-competitive integral solutions. These problems generalize\nonline set-cover, for which there is a polylogarithmic lower bound. Hence, our\nresults are close to tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 01:37:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 21:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-04"}

Based on the hydrophobic effect, we propose that gas molecules\ndissolved in water may aggregate into clusters in bulk water as well as at\nsolid/water interfaces.

It is argued that organic carbon burial is\nof minor importance to the accumulation of oxygen in a mainly anoxic world\nwhere aerobic respiration is not globally significant. Thus, for the Great\nOxidation Event (GOE) ~ 2.4 Gyr ago, an increasing flux of O2 due to its\nproduction by an expanding population of cyanobacteria is parameterized as the\nprimary source of O2. Various factors would have constrained cyanobacterial\nproliferation and O2 production during most of the Archean and therefore a long\ndelay between the appearance of cyanobacteria and oxygenation of the atmosphere\nis to be expected. Destruction of O2 via CH4 oxidation in the atmosphere was a\nmajor O2 sink during the Archean, and the GOE is explained to a significant\nextent by a large decline in the methanogen population and corresponding CH4\nflux which, in turn, was caused primarily by partial oxygenation of the surface\nocean. The partially oxygenated state of these waters also made it possible for\nan aerobic methanotroph population to become established. This further\ncontributed to the large reduction in the CH4 flux to the atmosphere by\nincreasing the consumption of CH4 diffusing upwards from the deeper anoxic\ndepths of the water column as well as any CH4 still being produced in the upper\nlayer. The reduction in the CH4 flux lowered the CH4 oxidation sink for O2 at\nabout the same time the metamorphic and volcanic gas sinks for O2 also\ndeclined. As the O2 source increased from an expanding population of\ncyanobacteria - triggered by a burst of continent formation ~ 2.7-2.4 Gyr ago -\nthe atmosphere flipped and became permanently oxygenated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 02:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-02"}

The VB interactions are obtained from the\nLagrangians written within the hidden local symmetry which, in addition to\nYukawa-type vector-baryon-baryon (VBB) vertices, naturally gives rise to a\ncontact interaction. Using the VBB vertices, we calculate the $t$-, $s$- and\n$u$-channel diagrams considering the octet baryon exchange in the latter two\ncases. For the PB channels we rely on the the Weingberg-Tomozawa interactions\nand calculate the PB $\\leftrightarrow$ VB transition amplitudes extending the\nKroll-Ruderman theorem by replacing the photon by the vector mesons. In\naddition to the low-lying $\\Lambda(1405)$, $\\Lambda(1670)$ found in previous\nworks, we find resonances which coincide well with: $\\Lambda(2000)$,\n$\\Sigma(1750) S_{11}$, $\\Sigma(1940) D_{13}$, $\\Sigma(2000) S_{11}$ and predict\nthree $\\Lambda^*$'s with $J^\\pi = 3/2^-$ and masses: $1754 - i2$ MeV, $1862 -\ni33$ MeV, $2139 - i14$ MeV together with a broad $1/2^-$ $\\Sigma^*$ with mass\n$\\sim$ 1430 MeV.

A theoretical model of 1D geometry describing the coronal loop is\napplied. The background temperature is allowed to change as a function of time\nand undergoes an exponential decay with characteristic cooling times typical\nfor coronal loops. The magnetic field is assumed to be uniform. Thermal\nconduction is the dominant mechanism of cooling the hot background plasma in\nthe presence of an unspecified thermodynamic source that maintains the initial\nequilibrium. The influence of the rapidly cooling background plasma on the\nbehaviour of standing acoustic (longitudinal) waves is investigated\nanalytically. The temporally evolving dispersion relation and wave amplitude\nare derived by using the WKB theory. An analytic solution for the\ntime-dependent amplitude that describes the influence of thermal conduction on\nthe standing longitudinal (acoustic) wave is obtained by exploiting the\nproperties of Sturm-Liouville problems. Next, numerical evaluations further\nillustrate the behaviour of the standing acoustic waves in a system with\nvariable, time dependent background. The results are applied to a number of\ndetected loop oscillations. We find a remarkable agreement between the\ntheoretical predictions and the observations. The cooling of the background\nplasma due to thermal conduction is found to cause a strong damping for the\nslow standing magneto-acoustic waves in hot coronal loops in general. Further\nto this, the increase in the value of thermal conductivity leads to a strong\ndecay in the amplitude of the longitudinal standing slow MHD waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 10:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-02"}

We show that high\nTc's above 15 K only emerge if the iron-arsenide layers are at most free of\nplatinum-substitution (x \\rightarrow 0) in contrast to recent reports. In fact\nPt-substitution is detrimental to higher Tc, which increases up to 38 K only by\ncharge doping of pure FeAs layers. We point out, that two different negatively\ncharged layers [(FeAs)10]n- and (Pt3+yAs8)m- compete for the electrons provided\nby the Ca2+ ions, which is unique in the field of iron-based superconductors.\nIn the parent compound Ca10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8), no excess charge dopes the\nFeAs-layer, and superconductivity has to be induced by Pt-substitution, albeit\nbelow 15 K. In contrast, the additional Pt-atom in the Pt4As8layer shifts the\ncharge balance between the layers equivalent to charge doping by 0.2 electrons\nper FeAs. Only in this case Tc raises to 38 K, but decreases again if\nadditionally platinum is substituted for iron.

We present photometric data of debris disks around HIP 103389 (HD\n199260), HIP 107350 (HN Peg, HD206860), and HIP 114948 (HD 219482), obtained in\nthe context of our Herschel Open Time Key Program DUNES (DUst around NEarby\nStars). Methods. We used Herschel/PACS to detect the thermal emission of the\nthree debris disks with a 3 sigma sensitivity of a few mJy at 100 um and 160\num. In addition, we obtained Herschel/PACS photometric data at 70 um for HIP\n103389. Two different approaches are applied to reduce the Herschel data to\ninvestigate the impact of data reduction on the photometry. We fit analytical\nmodels to the available spectral energy distribution (SED) data. Results. The\nSEDs of the three disks potentially exhibit an unusually steep decrease at\nwavelengths > 70 um. We investigate the significance of the peculiar shape of\nthese SEDs and the impact on models of the disks provided it is real. Our\nmodeling reveals that such a steep decrease of the SEDs in the long wavelength\nregime is inconsistent with a power-law exponent of the grain size distribution\n-3.5 expected from a standard equilibrium collisional cascade. In contrast, a\nvery distinct range of grain sizes is implied to dominate the thermal emission\nof such disks. However, we demonstrate that the understanding of the data of\nfaint sources obtained with Herschel is still incomplete and that the\nsignificance of our results depends on the version of the data reduction\npipeline used. Conclusions. A new mechanism to produce the dust in the\npresented debris disks, deviations from the conditions required for a standard\nequilibrium collisional cascade (grain size exponent of -3.5), and/or\nsignificantly different dust properties would be necessary to explain the\npotentially steep SED shape of the three debris disks presented.

It is a sequence of simplicial complexes built on a metric space to\nadd topological structure to an otherwise disconnected set of points. It is\nwidely used because it encodes useful information about the topology of the\nunderlying metric space. This information is often extracted from its so-called\npersistence diagram. Unfortunately, this filtration is often too large to\nconstruct in full. We show how to construct an O(n)-size filtered simplicial\ncomplex on an $n$-point metric space such that its persistence diagram is a\ngood approximation to that of the Vietoris-Rips filtration. This new filtration\ncan be constructed in $O(n\\log n)$ time. The constant factors in both the size\nand the running time depend only on the doubling dimension of the metric space\nand the desired tightness of the approximation. For the first time, this makes\nit computationally tractable to approximate the persistence diagram of the\nVietoris-Rips filtration across all scales for large data sets.\n  We describe two different sparse filtrations. The first is a zigzag\nfiltration that removes points as the scale increases. The second is a\n(non-zigzag) filtration that yields the same persistence diagram.

In particular, dust can overtake H_2 as the leading\ncoolant at very high densities. The aim of this work is to determine the\ninfluence of dust cooling on the fragmentation of very low metallicity gas. To\ninvestigate this, we make use of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations with\nsink particles to replace contracting protostars, and analyze the collapse and\nfurther fragmentation of star-forming clouds.
