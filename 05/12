Here, we mainly focus on how these mesoscale structures\nare affected by the local and global structural properties. Analyzing the data\nof four large-scale online social networks reveals several common structural\nproperties. It is found that not only the local structures given by the\nindegree, outdegree, and reciprocal degree distributions follow a similar\nscaling behavior, the mesoscale structures represented by the distributions of\nclose-knit friendship structures also exhibit a similar scaling law. The degree\ncorrelation is very weak over a wide range of the degrees. We propose a simple\ndirected network model that captures the observed properties. The model\nincorporates two mechanisms: reciprocation and preferential attachment. Through\nrate equation analysis of our model, the local-scale and mesoscale structural\nproperties are derived. In the local-scale, the same scaling behavior of\nindegree and outdegree distributions stems from indegree and outdegree of nodes\nboth growing as the same function of the introduction time, and the reciprocal\ndegree distribution also shows the same power-law due to the linear\nrelationship between the reciprocal degree and in/outdegree of nodes. In the\nmesoscale, the distributions of four closed triples representing close-knit\nfriendship structures are found to exhibit identical power-laws, a behavior\nattributed to the negligible degree correlations. Intriguingly, all the\npower-law exponents of the distributions in the local-scale and mesoscale\ndepend only on one global parameter -- the mean in/outdegree, while both the\nmean in/outdegree and the reciprocity together determine the ratio of the\nreciprocal degree of a node to its in/outdegree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 17:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 04:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The main\ncontribution of this article is to show that dimensional reduction effects are\ndue to General Relativity at singularities, and do not need to be postulated\nad-hoc.\n  Recent advances in understanding the geometry of singularities do not require\nmodification of General Relativity, being just non-singular extensions of its\nmathematics to the limit cases. They turn out to work fine for some known types\nof cosmological singularities (black holes and FLRW Big-Bang), allowing a\nchoice of the fundamental geometric invariants and physical quantities which\nremain regular. The resulting equations are equivalent to the standard ones\noutside the singularities.\n  One consequence of this mathematical approach to the singularities in General\nRelativity is a special, (geo)metric type of dimensional reduction: at\nsingularities, the metric tensor becomes degenerate in certain spacetime\ndirections, and some properties of the fields become independent of those\ndirections. Effectively, it is like one or more dimensions of spacetime just\nvanish at singularities.

Those state-of-the-art\nrepresentations depend crucially on the choice of a codebook (visual\ndictionary), which is usually derived from the dataset. In general-purpose,\ndynamic image collections (e.g., the Web), one cannot have the entire\ncollection in order to extract a representative dictionary. However, based on\nthe hypothesis that the dictionary reflects only the diversity of low-level\nappearances and does not capture semantics, we argue that a dictionary based on\na small subset of the data, or even on an entirely different dataset, is able\nto produce a good representation, provided that the chosen images span a\ndiverse enough portion of the low-level feature space. Our experiments confirm\nthat hypothesis, opening the opportunity to greatly alleviate the burden in\ngenerating the codebook, and confirming the feasibility of employing visual\ndictionaries in large-scale dynamic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 18:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Assume further that it converges in distribution towards\n$F_\\infty$ satisfying ${\\rm Var}(F_\\infty)>0$. Our first result is a sequential\nversion of a theorem by Shigekawa (1980). More precisely, we prove, without\nadditional assumptions, that the sequence ${F_n}$ actually converges in total\nvariation and that the law of $F_\\infty$ is absolutely continuous. We give an\napplication to discrete non-Gaussian chaoses. In a second part, we assume that\neach $F_n$ has more specifically the form of a multiple Wiener-It\\^o integral\n(of a fixed order) and that it converges in $L^2(\\Omega)$ towards $F_\\infty$.\nWe then give an upper bound for the distance in total variation between the\nlaws of $F_n$ and $F_\\infty$. As such, we recover an inequality due to Davydov\nand Martynova (1987); our rate is weaker compared to Davydov and Martynova\n(1987) (by a power of 1/2), but the advantage is that our proof is not only\nsketched as in Davydov and Martynova (1987). Finally, in a third part we show\nthat the convergence in the celebrated Peccati-Tudor theorem actually holds in\nthe total variation topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 19:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 05:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 19:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 11:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-08"}

We introduce a method to measure the number of\nSNe and relative contribution of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and core-collapse\nsupernovae (SNe cc) by directly fitting X-ray spectral observations. The method\nhas been implemented as an XSPEC model called snapec. snapec utilizes a single\ntemperature thermal plasma code (apec) to model the spectral emission based on\nmetal abundances calculated using the latest SN yields from SN Ia and SN cc\nexplosion models. This approach provides a self-consistent single set of\nuncertainties on the total number of SN explosions and relative fraction of SN\ntypes in the ICM over the cluster lifetime by directly allowing these\nparameters to be determined by SN yields provided by simulations. We apply our\napproach to the XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC), Reflection\nGrating Spectrometer (RGS), and 200 ks simulated Astro-H observations of a\ncooling flow cluster, A3112. We find that various sets of SN yields present in\nthe literature produce an acceptable fit to the EPIC and RGS spectra of A3112.\nWe infer that 30.3% +/- 5.4% of the total SN explosions are SNe Ia, and the\ntotal number of SN explosions required to create the observed metals is in the\norder of (1.06 +/- 0.34)*10^{9}, from snapec fits to RGS spectra. These values\nmay be compared to the enrichment expected based on well-established\nempirically-measured SN rates per star formed. The proportions of SNe Ia and\nSNe cc inferred to have enriched the ICM in the inner 52 kpc of A3112 is\nconsistent with these specific rates, if one applies a correction for the\nmetals locked up in stars. At the same time, the inferred level of SN\nenrichment corresponds to a star-to-gas mass ratio that is several times\ngreater than the 10% estimated globally for clusters in the A3112 mass range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 20:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Harmonic\nfunctions arise in many applications, such as physics and the theory of\nstochastic processes. Of interest classically are harmonic polynomials, which\nhave a simple classification. Further, the work of Reznick, building on the\nwork of others, namely Sylvester, Clifford, Rosanes, Gundelfinger, Cartan,\nMaass and Helgason, has led to a classification of all polynomial solutions to\na differential equation of arising from a homogeneous polynomial over an\nalgebraically closed field.\n  The definition of harmonicity can be extended to the space of polynomials in\nfree variables using the concept of a noncommutative Laplacian. Given a\npositive integer $\\ell$, the $\\ell$-Laplacian of a noncommutative (abbreviated\nNC) polynomial $p$ in the direction $h$ is defined to be $$ \\lap_{\\ell}[p,h] :=\n\\sum_{i=1}^g \\frac{d^{\\ell}}{dt^{\\ell}} p(x_1,..., x_i + th,..., x_g).$$ A NC\npolynomial $p$ is said to be $\\ell$-harmonic if $\\lap_{\\ell}[p,h] = 0$. When\n$\\ell = 2$, then the $\\ell$-Laplacian is simply called the Laplacian and a\n$\\ell$-harmonic NC polynomial is simply called harmonic. More generally, the\nconcept of a constant coefficient differential equation can be extended to the\nspace of NC polynomials via the NC directional derivative.\n  The main contribution of this paper is to classify the set of $\\ell$-harmonic\nNC polynomials. The result is analogous to the classification of polynomial\nsolutions to a differential equation of the form $q(\\partial/\\partial x_1, ...,\n\\partial/\\partial x_g)y = 0$ given by Reznick. Additionally, this thesis proves\nnew results about NC \"subharmonic\" polynomials.\n  This work extends results of Helton, McAllaster, and Hernandez on NC harmonic\nand subharmonic polynomials, which classified solutions for the $\\ell = 2$ case\nin two noncommuting variables $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 22:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-19"}

Researchers\nhave recently examined a number of factors that affect information diffusion in\nonline social networks, including: the novelty of information, users' activity\nlevels, who they pay attention to, and how they respond to friends'\nrecommendations. Using URLs as markers of information, we carry out a detailed\nstudy of retweeting, the primary mechanism by which information spreads on the\nTwitter follower graph. Our empirical study examines how users respond to an\nincoming stimulus, i.e., a tweet (message) from a friend, and reveals that\n%retweeting behavior is constrained by a few simple principles. the \"principle\nof least effort\" combined with limited attention plays a dominant role in\nretweeting behavior. Specifically, we observe that users retweet information\nwhen it is most visible, such as when it near the top of their Twitter stream.\nMoreover, our measurements quantify how a user's limited attention is divided\namong incoming tweets, providing novel evidence that highly connected\nindividuals are less likely to propagate an arbitrary tweet.

The G-Wishart distribution, a\nconjugate prior for precision matrices satisfying general GGM constraints, has\nnow been in existence for over a decade. However, due to the lack of a direct\nsampler, its use has been limited in hierarchical Bayesian contexts, relegating\nmixing over the class of GGMs mostly to situations involving standard Gaussian\nlikelihoods. Recent work, however, has developed methods that couple model and\nparameter moves, first through reversible jump methods and later by direct\nevaluation of conditional Bayes factors and subsequent resampling.

A detailed SCF analysis\nindicates that under both unfolding scenario the arms of the star are extended\nfairly equally, i.e., no intra-molecular disproportionation occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 May 2012 08:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-15"}

Using the protocol of Blier and Tapp\n[arXiv:0709.0738], we show that in this case the proof system has the same\nexpressive power as non-deterministic exponential time (NEXP). Since\nsingle-proof QMA proof systems, with the same bound on the gap, have expressive\npower at most exponential time (EXP), we get a separation between single and\nmulti-prover proof systems in the 'small-gap setting', under the assumption\nthat EXP is not equal to NEXP. This implies, among others, the nonexistence of\ncertain operators called disentanglers (defined by Aaronson et al.\n[arXiv:0804.0802]), with good approximation parameters.\n  We also show that in this setting the proof system has the same expressive\npower if we restrict the verifier to be able to perform only Bell-measurements,\ni.e., using a BellQMA verifier. This is not known to hold in the usual setting,\nwhen the gap is bounded by an inverse-polynomial function of the input length.\nTo show this we use the protocol of Chen and Drucker [arXiv:1011.0716].

In the second observation with the highest signal-to-noise ratio,\nthe low energy (below 0.7 keV) spectral regime flattens when the flux is high,\nwhile the shape of the high energy part (1-1.7 keV) remains unchanged. This\nbehavior is qualitatively consistent with being caused by strong\nComptonization. Both the strong soft excess and spectral change consistent with\nComptonization in the X-ray spectrum imply that the Eddington ratio is large,\nwhich requires a small BH mass (smaller than ~10^5M_solar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 May 2012 12:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Estimating dynamic networks is\nan important task because they compromise valuable information about\ninteractions among genes. Graphical models are a powerful class of models to\nestimate conditional independence among random variables, e.g. interactions in\ndynamic systems. Indeed, these interactions tend to vary over time. However,\nthe literature has been focused on static networks, which can only reveal\noverall structures. Time-course experiments are performed in order to tease out\nsignificant changes in networks. It is typically reasonable to assume that\nchanges in genomic networks are few because systems in biology tend to be\nstable. We introduce a new model for estimating slowly changes in dynamic\ngene-regulatory networks which is suitable for a high-dimensional dataset, e.g.\ntime-course genomic data.

Soliplasmon states (propagating surface soliton-plasmon modes) can\nbe then analytically calculated as eigenmodes of this non-selfadjoint operator.\nThe theoretical treatment of the system predicts the key features of the\nstationary solutions and gives physical insight to understand the inherent\nstability and dynamics observed by means of finite element numerical modeling\nof the time independent nonlinear Maxwell equations.
