We study the effect\nboth numerically, by inserting HCD systems on mock spectra for a specific\nmodel, and analytically, in the context of two-point correlations and linear\ntheory. We show that the presence of HCDs substantially contributes to the\nnoise of the correlation function measurement, and systematically alters the\nmeasured redshift-space correlation function of the Lyman \\alpha forest,\nincreasing the value of the density bias factor and decreasing the redshift\ndistortion parameter $\\beta_\\alpha$ of the Lyman \\alpha forest. We provide\nsimple formulae for corrections on these derived parameters, as a function of\nthe mean effective optical depth and bias factor of the host halos of the HCDs,\nand discuss the conditions under which these expressions should be valid. In\npractice, precise corrections to the measured parameters of the Lyman \\alpha\nforest correlation for the HCD effects are more complex than the simple\nanalytical approximations we present, owing to non-linear effects of the damped\nwings of the HCD systems and the presence of three-point terms. However, we\nconclude that an accurate correction for these HCD effects can be obtained\nnumerically and calibrated with observations of the HCD-Lyman \\alpha\ncross-correlation. We also discuss an analogous formalism to treat and correct\nfor the contaminating effect of metal lines overlapping the Lyman \\alpha forest\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 16:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Unlike iteration by pointwise\nconvergence, hyperation preserves normality. The hyperation of a normal\nfunction f is a sequence of normal functions so that f^0= id, f^1 = f and for\nall ordinals \\alpha, \\beta we have that f^(\\alpha + \\beta) = f^\\alpha f^\\beta.\nThese conditions do not determine f^\\alpha uniquely; in addition, we require\nthat the functions be minimal in an appropriate sense. We study hyperations\nsystematically and show that they are a natural refinement of Veblen\nprogressions.\n  Next, we define cohyperations, very similar to hyperations except that they\nare left-additive: given \\alpha, \\beta, f^(\\alpha + \\beta)= f^\\beta f^\\alpha.\nCohyperations iterate initial functions which are functions that map initial\nsegments to initial segments. We systematically study cohyperations and see how\nthey can be employed to define left inverses to hyperations.\n  Hyperations provide an alternative presentation of Veblen progressions and\ncan be useful where a more fine-grained analysis of such sequences is called\nfor. They are very amenable to algebraic manipulation and hence are convenient\nto work with. Cohyperations, meanwhile, give a novel way to describe slowly\nincreasing functions as often appear, for example, in proof theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 17:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-10"}

If recombination is more rapid than selection,\npopulations consist of a diverse mixture of many genotypes, as is observed in\nmany populations. In the opposite regime, which is realized for example in the\nfacultatively sexual populations that outcross in only a fraction of\nreproductive cycles, selection can amplify individual genotypes into large\nclones. Such clones emerge when the fitness advantage of some of the genotypes\nis large enough that they grow to a significant fraction of the population\ndespite being broken down by recombination. The occurrence of this \"clonal\ncondensation\" depends, in addition to the outcrossing rate, on the heritability\nof fitness. Clonal condensation leads to a strong genetic heterogeneity of the\npopulation which is not adequately described by traditional population genetics\nmeasures, such as Linkage Disequilibrium. Here we point out the similarity\nbetween clonal condensation and the freezing transition in the Random Energy\nModel of spin glasses. Guided by this analogy we explicitly calculate the\nprobability, Y, that two individuals are genetically identical as a function of\nthe key parameters of the model.

In addition to the coning motion itself, Coning\nTheory explains the spinning bullet's aerodynamic jump and its steadily\nincreasing yaw of repose together with its resulting spin-drift. The total\naerodynamic force on the bullet comprises its drag and lift rectangular\ncomponents and produces an associated overturning moment acting upon the rigid\nbullet. The coning motion of the bullet includes two distinct but synchronized\naspects: 1) the well-known gyroscopic precession of the spin-axis of the\nbullet, and 2) the previously little-known orbiting of the center of gravity of\nthe bullet around its mean trajectory with the nose of the bullet angled inward\ntoward that trajectory.

The gamma-ray binary LS 5039 and the isolated pulsar PSR J1825-1446\nwere proposed to have been formed in the supernova remnant (SNR) G016.8-01.1.\nAims. We aim to obtain the Galactic trajectory of LS 5039 and PSR J1825-1446 to\nfind their origin in the Galaxy, and in particular to check their association\nwith SNR G016.8-01.1 to restrict their age. Methods. By means of radio and\noptical observations we obtained the proper motion and the space velocity of\nthe sources. Results. The proper motion of PSR J1825-1446 corresponds to a\ntransverse space velocity of 690 km/s at a distance of 5 kpc. Its Galactic\nvelocity at different distances is not compatible with the expected Galactic\nrotation. The velocity and characteristic age of PSR J1825-1446 make it\nincompatible with SNR G016.8-01.1. There are no clear OB associations or SNRs\ncrossing the past trajectory of PSR J1825-1446. We estimate the age of the\npulsar to be 80-245 kyr, which is compatible with its characteristic age. The\nproper motion of LS 5039 is 7.09 and -8.82 mas/yr in right ascension and\ndeclination, respectively. The association of LS 5039 with SNR G016.8-01.1 is\nunlikely, although we cannot to discard it. The system would have had to be\nformed in the association Ser OB2 (at 2.0 kpc) if the age of the system is\n1.0-1.2 Myr, or in the association Sct OB3 (distance 1.5-2 kpc) for an age of\n0.1-0.2 Myr. If the system were not formed close to Ser OB2, the\npseudo-synchronization of the orbit would be unlikely. Conclusions. PSR\nJ1825-1446 is a high-velocity isolated pulsar ejected from the Galaxy. The\ndistance to LS 5039, which needs to be constrained by future astrometric\nmissions such as Gaia, is a key parameter for restricting its origin and age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 19:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Studies of the X-ray properties in\nyoung clusters allow to understand these mechanisms. One ideal target for this\nanalysis is the Eagle Nebula (M16), with its central cluster NGC6611. At 1750\npc from the Sun, it harbors 93 OB stars, together with a population of low-mass\nstars from embedded protostars to disk-less Class III objects, with age <=\n3Myrs. We study an archival 78 ksec Chandra/ACIS-I observation of NGC6611, and\ntwo new 80ksec observations of the outer region of M16, one centered on the\nColumn V, and one on a region of the molecular cloud with ongoing\nstar-formation. We detect 1755 point sources, with 1183 candidate cluster\nmembers (219 disk-bearing and 964 disk-less). We study the global X-ray\nproperties of M16 and compare them with those of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We\nalso compare the level of X-ray emission of Class II and Class III stars, and\nanalyze the X-ray spectral properties of OB stars. Our study supports the lower\nlevel of X-ray activity for the disk-bearing stars with respect to the\ndisk-less members. The X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF) of M16 is similar to\nthat of Orion, supporting the universality of the XLF in young clusters. 85% of\nthe O stars of NGC6611 have been detected in X-rays. With only one possible\nexception, they show soft spectra with no hard component, indicating that\nmechanisms for the production of hard X-ray emission in O stars are not\noperating in NGC 6611.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 22:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The resulting behaviour consists of two main phases. Firstly, a\ntransient reconnection phase, in which the current in the layer is rapidly\ndispersed and some flux is reconnected. This dispersal of current launches a\nfamily of small amplitude magnetic and plasma perturbations, which propagate\naway from the null at the local fast and slow magnetosonic speeds. The vast\nmajority of the magnetic energy released in this phase goes into internal\nenergy of the plasma, and only a tiny amount is converted into kinetic energy.\nIn the wake of the outwards propagating pulses, an imbalance of Lorentz and\npressure forces creates a stagnation flow which drives a regime of impulsive\nbursty reconnection, in which fast reconnection is turned on and off in a\nturbulent manner as the current density exceeds and falls below a critical\nvalue. During this phase, the null current density is continuously built up\nabove a certain critical level, then dissipated very rapidly, and built up\nagain, in a stochastic manner. Interestingly, the magnetic energy converted\nduring this quasi-steady phase is greater than that converted during the\ninitial transient reconnection phase. Again essentially all the energy\nconverted during this phase goes directly to internal energy. These results are\nof potential importance for solar flares and coronal heating, and set a\nconceptually important reference for future 3D studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 22:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-07"}

Unstable fixed points are central to understanding\nHamiltonian chaos in classical systems. In many-body quantum systems,\nmean-field approximations fail in the vicinity of unstable fixed points and\nlead to dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations. Here, we measure the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body quantum pendulum initialized to a\nhyperbolic fixed point of the phase space. The experiment uses a spin-1 Bose\ncondensate, which exhibits Josephson dynamics in the spin populations that\ncorrespond in the mean-field limit to motion of a non-rigid mechanical\npendulum. The condensate is initialized to a minimum uncertainty spin state,\nand quantum fluctuations lead to non-linear spin evolution along a separatrix\nand non-Gaussian probability distributions that are measured to be in good\nagreement with exact quantum calculations up to 0.25 s. At longer times, atomic\nloss due to the finite lifetime of the condensate leads to larger spin\noscillation amplitudes compared to no loss case as orbits depart from the\nseparatrix. This demonstrates how decoherence of a many-body system can result\nin more apparent coherent behaviour.

We find that the previous cross-section gives a\nsignificantly softer spectrum than found in the data of LHC. In this paper, we\nfocus our interest mainly upon the LHC forward (LHCf) experiment, giving\ngamma-ray spectra in the very forward region with the pseudo-rapidity $\\eta^*$\n> 8.8 in the center of mass system (CMS), which have not been reported so far.\nWe also give the pseudo-rapidity distribution of charged hadrons with -3 <\n$\\eta^*$ < 3 obtained by ALICE and TOTEM experiments, both with LHC. We find\nthat the revised cross-section reproduces quite well the accelerator data over\nthe wide energy range from GeV to 30 PeV for projectile protons, corresponding\napproximately to 100 MeV to 3 PeV for secondary gamma-rays. The production\ncross-section of gamma-rays produced in the forward region is essential for the\nstudy of gamma-ray astronomy, while not important are those produced in the\ncentral region in CMS, and of much less importance in the backward. We discuss\nalso the average transverse momentum of gamma-rays, $\\bar{p}_{t}$, and the\naverage inelasticity transferred to gamma-rays, $\\bar{k}_\\gamma^*$, obtaining\nthat the former increases very slowly with $\\bar{p}_{t}$ = 100 - 220 MeV/c for\n$E_0$ = 1 GeV - 26 PeV, and the latter is almost independent of $E_0$, with\n$\\bar{k}_\\gamma^* \\approx 1/6$, while we can not exclude the possibility of a\nsmall increase of $\\bar{k}_\\gamma^*$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 02:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 03:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-10"}

Specifically, we\nconsider a setting in which k identical (probabilistic) agents, initially\nplaced at some central location, collectively search for a treasure in the\ntwo-dimensional plane. The treasure is placed at a target location by an\nadversary and the goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both\nk and D, where D is the distance between the central location and the target.\nThis is biologically motivated by cooperative, central place foraging such as\nperformed by ants around their nest. In this type of search there is a strong\npreference to locate nearby food sources before those that are further away.\nOur focus is on trying to find what can be achieved if communication is limited\nor altogether absent. Indeed, to avoid overlaps agents must be highly dispersed\nmaking communication difficult. Furthermore, if agents do not commence the\nsearch in synchrony then even initial communication is problematic. This holds,\nin particular, with respect to the question of whether the agents can\ncommunicate and conclude their total number, k. It turns out that the knowledge\nof k by the individual agents is crucial for performance. Indeed, it is a\nstraightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is\n$\\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched\nif the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation.

CoKu Tau 1, seen close to\nedge-on, shows a spatially unresolved line centered at the stellar rest\nvelocity, although cross-dispersion centroids move within 10 AU from one side\nof the star to the other as a function of wavelength. The line profile is\nsymmetric with wings extending up to about +-80 km/s. The origin of the [Ne II]\nline could either be due to the bipolar jet or to the disk. For the stars with\nVLT-UVES observations, in several cases, the optical forbidden line profiles\nand shifts are very similar to the profile of the [Ne II] line, suggesting that\nthe lines are emitted in the same region. A general trend observed with VISIR\nis a lower line flux when compared with the fluxes obtained with Spitzer. We\nfound no correlation between the line full-width at half maximum and the line\npeak velocity. The [Ne II] line remains undetected in a large part of the\nsample, an indication that the emission detected with Spitzer in those stars is\nlikely extended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 07:51:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 07:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A key merit of this approach\nis that it neither assumes knowledge of the uncertainty set, as it is common in\nrobust optimization, nor of its probability distribution, as it is usually\nrequired in stochastic optimization. Moreover, the scenario approach is\ncomputationally efficient as its solution is based on a deterministic\noptimization program that is canonically convex, even when the original\nchance-constrained problem is not. Recently, researchers have obtained\ntheoretical foundations for the scenario approach, providing a direct link\nbetween the number of scenarios and bounds on the constraint violation\nprobability. These bounds are tight in the general case of an uncertain\noptimization problem with a single chance constraint. However, this paper shows\nthat these bounds can be improved in situations where the constraints have a\nlimited `support rank', a new concept that is introduced for the first time.\nThis property is typically found in a large number of practical\napplications---most importantly, if the problem originally contains multiple\nchance constraints (e.g. multi-stage uncertain decision problems), or if a\nchance constraint belongs to a special class of constraints (e.g. linear or\nquadratic constraints). In these cases the quality of the scenario solution is\nimproved while the same bound on the constraint violation probability is\nmaintained, and also the computational complexity is reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 08:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 17:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 09:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Six\nleading Neptune Trojans around the Lagrange point L4 discovered earlier have\nbeen studied in detail, but two trailing ones found recently around the L5\npoint, 2004 KV18 and 2008 LC18, have not been investigated yet. In this paper,\nwe report our investigations on the dynamical behaviors of these two new\nNeptune Trojans. Our calculations show that the asteroid 2004 KV18 is a\ntemporary Neptune Trojan. Most probably, it was captured into the trailing\nTrojan cloud no earlier than 203kyr ago, and it will not keep this identity no\nlater than 165kyr in future. Based on the statistics on our orbital\nsimulations, we argue that this object is more like a scattered Kuiper belt\nobject. On the contrary, the orbit of asteroid 2008 LC18 is much more stable.\nAmong the clone orbits spread within the orbital uncertainties, a considerable\nportion of clones may survive on the L5 tadpole orbits for 4Gyr. The strong\ndependence of the stability on the semimajor axis and resonant angle suggests\nthat further observations are badly needed to confine the orbit in the stable\nregion.

The isothermal magnetic field ($H||c$ axis)\ndependent magnetization ($M$) loops exhibit a second peak (SP) or `fishtail\neffect', as well as remarkable flux jumps at low temperatures. The critical\ncurrent density $J_c$ obtained from the $M(H)$ loops is rather high, of the\norder of 10$^6$ A/cm$^2$. The analysis of the temperature and field dependent\n$J_c$ implies that high $J_c$ is mainly due to collective (weak) pinning of\nvortices by dense microscopic point defects with some contribution from a\nstrong pinning mechanism. Pronounced magnetic instabilities in terms of flux\njumps depend strongly on temperature as well on the field sweep rate. The field\nfor first flux jump as calculated from an adiabatic model, however, is much\nlower than the experimentally observed values, and this enhanced stability is\nattributed to a flux creep phenomenon. The analysis of field dependent magnetic\nrelaxation data additionally supports a collective pinning model. The data\nfurther suggests that SP in M(H) is likely related to crossover in creep\ndynamics from elastic to plastic mechanism. We have constructed the vortex\nphase diagram on field-temperature plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 09:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-05"}

We find no\nevidence for gravitational-wave counterparts, either with any individual GRB in\nthis sample or with the population as a whole. For all GRBs we place lower\nbounds on the distance to the progenitor, under the optimistic assumption of a\ngravitational-wave emission energy of 10^-2 M c^2 at 150 Hz, with a median\nlimit of 17 Mpc. For short hard GRBs we place exclusion distances on binary\nneutron star and neutron star-black hole progenitors, using astrophysically\nmotivated priors on the source parameters, with median values of 16 Mpc and 28\nMpc respectively. These distance limits, while significantly larger than for a\nsearch that is not aided by GRB satellite observations, are not large enough to\nexpect a coincidence with a GRB. However, projecting these exclusions to the\nsensitivities of Advanced LIGO and Virgo, which should begin operation in 2015,\nwe find that the detection of gravitational waves associated with GRBs will\nbecome quite possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 09:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 08:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 17:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Some argue that it is a bimodal distribution, implying that there\nare two separate QSO populations (normally referred to as 'radio-loud' and\n'radio-quiet'), while others claim it forms a more continuous distribution\ncharacteristic of a single population. We use deep observations at 20 GHz to\ninvestigate whether the distribution is bimodal at high radio frequencies.\nCarrying out this study at high radio frequencies has an advantage over\nprevious studies as the radio emission comes predominantly from the core of the\nAGN, hence probes the most recent activity. Studies carried out at lower\nfrequencies are dominated by the large scale lobes where the emission is built\nup over longer timescales (10^7-10^8 yrs), thereby confusing the sample. Our\nsample comprises 874 X-ray selected QSOs that were observed as part of the 6dF\nGalaxy Survey. Of these, 40% were detected down to a 3 sigma detection limit of\n0.2-0.5 mJy.\n  No evidence of bimodality is seen in either the 20 GHz luminosity\ndistribution or in the distribution of the R_20 parameter: the ratio of the\nradio to optical luminosities traditionally used to classify objects as being\neither radio-loud or radio-quiet. Previous results have claimed that at low\nradio luminosities, star formation processes can dominate the radio emission\nobserved in QSOs. We attempt to investigate these claims by stacking the\nundetected sources at 20 GHz and discuss the limitations in carrying out this\nanalysis. However, if the radio emission was solely due to star formation\nprocesses, we calculate that this corresponds to star formation rates ranging\nfrom ~10 solar masses/yr to ~2300 solar masses/yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 11:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The proposed network approach to symbolic sequences\nis generic and can be applied to any symbol sequence (artificial or natural).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 12:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

At radio frequencies,\nfree from dust extinction, it is possible to detect compact components within\nthe innermost LIRG nuclear regions, such as SNe and SN remnants, as well as AGN\nburied deep in the LIRG nuclei. We studied the LIRG IC883 aiming at: (i)\ninvestigating its (circum-)nuclear regions using the e-EVN at 5GHz, and\ne-MERLIN at 6.9GHz, complemented by archival VLBI data; (ii) detecting at radio\nfrequencies the two recently reported circumnuclear SNe 2010cu and 2011hi,\nwhich were discovered by near-IR (NIR) adaptive optics observations of IC883;\nand (iii) further investigating the nature of SN2011hi at NIR by means of\nobservations with Gemini-North. The circumnuclear regions traced by e-MERLIN at\n6.9GHz have an extension of ~1kpc, and show a striking double-sided structure,\nwhich very likely corresponds to a warped rotating ring, in agreement with\nprevious studies. Our e-EVN observations at 5GHz and complementary archival\nVLBI data at 5GHz and 8.4GHz, reveal the presence of various milliarcsec\ncompact components in the nucleus of IC883. A single compact source, an AGN\ncandidate, dominates the emission at both nuclear and circumnuclear scales, as\nimaged with the e-EVN and e-MERLIN, respectively. The other milliarcsec\ncomponents are very suggestive of ongoing nuclear CCSN activity.

New generation MARCS model atmospheres and the Turbospectrum\ncode for radiative transfer have been used. We have also taken into account as\ncomplete as possible atomic and molecular linelists. A new grid of 16783 high\nresolution spectra over the wavelength range 3000 to 12000 {\\AA} has been\ncomputed with a spectral resolution always larger than 150000. Normalised and\nabsolute flux versions are available over a wide range of stellar atmospheric\nparameters for stars of FGKM spectral types. The covered parameters are\n2500K\\leqTeff\\leq8000K, -0.5\\leqlog(g)\\leq5.5dex, -5.0\\leq[M/H]\\leq+1.0 dex and\nfive different values of the enrichment in {\\alpha}-elements have been\nconsidered (0.0, \\pm0.2 dex and \\pm0.4 dex around the standard values). This\ngrid is made publicly available through the POLLUX database (about 50% of the\nspectra are already included in this database) and in FITS format upon request\nto the authors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 14:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

These statistics are limited by selection effects, but they are\nbecoming increasingly discriminating. In particular, it appears (a) that brown\ndwarfs that are secondaries to Sun-like stars tend to be on wide orbits, $a\\ga\n100\\,{\\rm AU}$ (the Brown Dwarf Desert), and (b) that these brown dwarfs have a\nsignificantly higher chance of being in a close ($a\\la 10\\,{\\rm AU}$) binary\nsystem with another brown dwarf than do brown dwarfs in the field. This then\nraises the issue of whether these brown dwarfs have formed {\\it in situ}, i.e.\nby fragmentation of a circumstellar disc; or have formed elsewhere and\nsubsequently been captured. We present numerical simulations of the purely\ngravitational interaction between a close brown-dwarf binary and a Sun-like\nstar. These simulations demonstrate that such interactions have a negligible\nchance ($<0.001$) of leading to the close brown-dwarf binary being captured by\nthe Sun-like star. Making the interactions dissipative by invoking the\nhydrodynamic effects of attendant discs might alter this conclusion. However,\nin order to explain the above statistics, this dissipation would have to favour\nthe capture of brown-dwarf binaries over single brown-dwarfs, and we present\narguments why this is unlikely. The simplest inference is that most brown-dwarf\nbinaries -- and therefore possibly also most single brown dwarfs -- form by\nfragmentation of circumstellar discs around Sun-like protostars, with some of\nthem subsequently being ejected into the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 14:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Our second aim was to show that the TSBTS scheme is as suitable\nas previously known schemes for developing parallel $N$--body codes. In this\nwork, we relied on a parallel scheme using the copy algorithm for the\ntime-symmetric scheme. We implemented a hybrid of data and task parallelization\nfor force calculation to handle load balancing problems that can appear in\npractice. Using the Plummer model initial conditions for different numbers of\nparticles, we obtained the expected efficiency and speedup for a small number\nof particles. Although parallelization of the direct $N$--body codes is\nnegatively affected by the communication/calculation ratios, we obtained good\nload balance results.

Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be\nreconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from\ncompressed sensing and matrix completion.

First, they assume that the probability of\ncreating a link between two nodes is determined only by the community\nmemberships of the nodes; however other factors (e.g. popularity) could also\naffect the link pattern. Second, they use generative models to model the\ncontent of individual nodes, whereas these generative models are vulnerable to\nthe content attributes that are irrelevant to communities. We propose a\nBayesian framework for combining link and content information for community\ndetection that explicitly addresses these shortcomings. A new link model is\npresented that introduces a random variable to capture the node popularity when\ndeciding the link between two nodes; a discriminative model is used to\ndetermine the community membership of a node by its content. An approximate\ninference algorithm is presented for efficient Bayesian inference.

For example, this problem arises naturally when trying\nto automatically assign gene function using a controlled vocabularies like Gene\nOntology. However, most existing approaches for predicting gene functions solve\nindependent classification problems to predict genes that are involved in a\ngiven function category, independently of the rest. Here, we propose two simple\nmethods for incorporating information about the hierarchical nature of the\ncategorization scheme. In the first method, we use information about a gene's\nprevious annotation to set an initial prior on its label. In a second approach,\nwe extend a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm for predicting gene\nfunction in a hierarchy. We show that we can efficiently solve this problem by\nsolving a linear system of equations. We compare these approaches with a\nprevious label reconciliation-based approach. Results show that using the\nhierarchy information directly, compared to using reconciliation methods,\nimproves gene function prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 17:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}

Such a requirement is usually in\nconflict with a learner's primary pursuit of prediction accuracy. To address\nthis dilemma, we introduce a novel Bayesian online classi cation algorithm,\ncalled the Virtual Vector Machine. The virtual vector machine allows you to\nsmoothly trade-off prediction accuracy with memory size. The virtual vector\nmachine summarizes the information contained in the preceding data stream by a\nGaussian distribution over the classi cation weights plus a constant number of\nvirtual data points. The virtual data points are designed to add extra\nnon-Gaussian information about the classi cation weights. To maintain the\nconstant number of virtual points, the virtual vector machine adds the current\nreal data point into the virtual point set, merges two most similar virtual\npoints into a new virtual point or deletes a virtual point that is far from the\ndecision boundary. The information lost in this process is absorbed into the\nGaussian distribution. The extra information provided by the virtual points\nleads to improved predictive accuracy over previous online classification\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 17:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}
