The vacancy defect is modeled by the addition of the on-site\nperturbation potential to the Hamiltonian. We find that, when (t'/t) << 1, the\nvacancy induced {\\pi}-state at the zero of energy(zero-mode state(ZMS)) does\nnot inhabit the minority sub-lattice due to the strong scalar potential induced\nby the vacancy(the ZMSs get lodged in the majority sub-lattice) whereas, when\n(t'/t) is increased, the ZMS is somewhat suppressed. This shows that, not only\nthe shift of the Fermi energy away from the linearly-dispersive Dirac points,\nthe issue of this topological localization is also hinged on the ratio (t'/t).\nFurthermore, when a vacancy is present, the three sp2- hybridized {\\sigma}\nstates of each of the three nearest-neighbor carbon atoms, forming a carbon\ntriangle surrounding the vacancy, are close to the Fermi energy (EF). The\nHund's coupling between these {\\sigma} electrons and the remaining electron\nwhich occupies the {\\pi} state spin polarizes the {\\pi} state leading to local\nmoment formation close to EF. Since the system at the Fermi level has low\nelectronic density, there is poor screening of such magnetic moments. This may\nlead to a high Curie temperature for such vacancy-induced moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 16:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

Applying the\nPMC for the $t\\bar{t}$-pair hadroproduction at the NNLO level, we have found\nthat the total cross-sections $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ at both the Tevatron and LHC\nremain almost unchanged when taking very disparate initial scales $\\mu^{\\rm\ninit}_R$ equal to $m_t$, $10\\,m_t$, $20\\,m_t$ and $\\sqrt{s}$, which is\nconsistent with renormalization group invariance. As an important new\napplication, we apply PMC scale-setting to study the top-quark forward-backward\nasymmetry. We observe that the more convergent perturbative series after PMC\nscale-setting leads to a more accurate top-quark forward-backward asymmetry.\nThe resulting PMC prediction on the asymmetry is also free from the initial\nrenormalization scale-dependence. Because the NLO PMC scale has a dip behavior\nfor the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel at small subprocess collision energies, the\nimportance of this channel to the asymmetry is increased.

We explore this theme by\ncomputing the (scalar or electromagnetic) self-force when the body is a\nspherical ball of perfect fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium, under the\nassumption that its rest-mass density and pressure are related by a polytropic\nequation of state. The body is strongly self-gravitating, and all computations\nare performed in exact general relativity. The dependence on internal structure\nis best revealed by expanding the self-force in powers of 1/r, with r denoting\nthe radial position of the charge outside the body. To the leading order, the\nself-force scales as 1/r^3 and depends only on the square of the charge and the\nbody's mass; the leading self-force is universal. The dependence on internal\nstructure is seen at the next order, 1/r^5, through a structure factor that\ndepends on the equation of state. We compute this structure factor for\nrelativistic polytropes, and show that for a fixed mass, it increases linearly\nwith the body's radius in the case of the scalar self-force, and quadratically\nwith the body's radius in the case of the electromagnetic self-force.

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs\nwill therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and\ndetermine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even\nto test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the\ndynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace. This includes a Chern-Simons parameter that controls the strength of\ngravitational deviations from General Relativity. We find that, if Dynamical\nChern-Simons Modified Gravity is the correct theory, an observatory like LISA\nor even eLISA/NGO should be able to measure the Chern-Simons parameter with\nfractional errors below 5%. If General Relativity is the true theory, these\nobservatories should put bounds on this parameter at the level xi^(1/4) < 10^4\nkm, which is four orders of magnitude better than current Solar System bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 23:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 21:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

Leibniz advocated primary timelessness and Mach that `time is to\nbe abstracted from change'. I consider 3 distinct viewpoints on Machian time:\nBarbour's, Rovelli's and my own. I provide four expansions on Barbour's taking\nconfiguration space to be primary: to (perhaps a weakened notion of) phase\nspace, categorizing, perspecting and propositioning. Categorizing means\nconsidering not only object spaces but also the corresponding morphisms and\nthen functors between such pairs.

By propositioning, I mean considering the set of\npropositions about a physical (sub)system. I argue against categorization being\nmore than a formal pre-requisite for quantization in general; however,\nperspecting is a categorical operation, and propositioning leads one to\nconsidering topoi, with Isham and Doering's work represents one possibility for\na mathematically sharp implementation of propositioning.

Special attention is paid\nto the translational invariance in the sheared frame, which requires an\nappropriate definition of the transient time-correlators. The derived MCT\nequation satisfies the alignment of the wavevectors, and is manifestly\ntranslationally invariant. Isothermal condition is implemented by the\nintroduction of the current fluctuation in the dissipative coupling to the\nthermostat. This current fluctation grows in the $\\alpha$-relaxation regime,\nwhich generates a deviation of the yield stress in the glassy phase from the\noverdamped case.

We divide the kinetic energy space of the molecules of P\ninto two regions F and D, and show that the molecules of P randomly switch\n(`oscillate') between the two states as time proceeds due to collisions with\nthe molecules of Q. Initially, the molecules of P are all in the state D,\nhowever because each molecule in P collides with the molecules of Q at\ndifferent times, the oscillations occur out of step with each other. There is a\nnet destructive interference between the oscillations, and so they are not\nobserved when monitoring the average kinetic energy of the molecules of P as a\nfunction of time. We will explain the similarities and differences between this\nobservation and transverse relaxation processes that occur in magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy.

We have divided\nour endeavours into three separate projects. First, we consider SUSY models\nwhere the gluino production at the LHC should be rich in top and bottom quark\njets. Requiring $b$-jets in addition to missing energy $\\eslt$ should,\ntherefore, enhance the supersymmetry signal relative to Standard Model\nbackgrounds. We quantify the increase in the supersymmetry reach of the LHC\nfrom $b$-tagging in a variety of well-motivated models of supersymmetry. We\nalso explore $top$-tagging at the LHC. Second, we explore the prospects for\ndetecting the direct production of third generation squarks in models with an\ninverted squark mass hierarchy. This is signalled by $b$-jets + $\\eslt$ events\nharder than in the Standard Model, but softer than those from the production of\ngluinos and heavier squarks. We find that these events can be readily separated\nfrom SM background (for third generation squark masses in the 200-400 GeV\nrange), and the contamination from the much heavier gluinos and squarks\nalthough formidable can effectively be suppressed. Third, we attempt to extract\nmodel-independent information about neutralino properties from LHC data.\nassuming only the particle content of the MSSM and that all two-body neutralino\ndecays are kinematically suppressed, with the neutralino inclusive production\nyielding a sufficient cross section.

The\ndesign of a telemonitoring system via a wireless body-area network with low\nenergy consumption for ambulatory use is highly desirable. As an emerging\ntechnique, compressed sensing (CS) shows great promise in\ncompressing/reconstructing data with low energy consumption. However, due to\nsome specific characteristics of raw FECG recordings such as non-sparsity and\nstrong noise contamination, current CS algorithms generally fail in this\napplication.\n  This work proposes to use the block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) framework\nto compress/reconstruct non-sparse raw FECG recordings. Experimental results\nshow that the framework can reconstruct the raw recordings with high quality.\nEspecially, the reconstruction does not destroy the interdependence relation\namong the multichannel recordings. This ensures that the independent component\nanalysis decomposition of the reconstructed recordings has high fidelity.\nFurthermore, the framework allows the use of a sparse binary sensing matrix\nwith much fewer nonzero entries to compress recordings.

These equations contain averages over the Bloch phase\nwhich are integrals of the unknown electric field and are derived by singular\nperturbation methods. Among the solutions of the hydrodynamic equations, at a\n70 K lattice temperature, there are spatially inhomogeneous Bloch oscillations\ncoexisting with moving electric field domains and Gunn-type oscillations of the\ncurrent.

In the second one we confirmed the existence of the lower boundary in\nthe scatter plot of core component pulse-widths versus pulsar period W50 sim\n2.5 P^{-0.5}[deg], first discovered by Rankin using much smaller number of\ninterpulse cases. In this paper we show that the same lower boundary also\nexists for conal profile components. Rankin proposed a very simple method of\nestimation of pulsar inclination angle based on comparing the width W50 of its\ncore component with the period dependent value of the lower boundary. We claim\nthat this method can be extended to conal components as well. To explain an\nexistence of the lower boundary Rankin proposed that the core emission\noriginates at or near the polar cap surface. We demonstrated clearly that no\ncoherent pulsar radio emission can originate at altitudes lower than 10 stellar\nradii, irrespective of the actual mechanism of coherence. We argue that the\nlower boundary reflects the narrowest angular structures that can be\ndistinguished in the average pulsar beam. These structures represent the core\nand the conal components in mean pulsar profiles. The P^{-0.5} dependence\nfollows from the dipolar nature of magnetic field lines in the radio emission\nregion, while the numerical factor of about 2.5 deg reflects the curvature\nradius of a non-dipolar surface magnetic field in the partially screened gap\nabove the polar cap, where dense electron-positron plasma is created. Both core\nand conal emission should originate at altitudes of about 50 stellar radii in a\ntypical pulsar, with a possibility that the core beam is emitted at a slightly\nlower heights than the conal ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 06:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The computation of discord is mostly confined to two-qubit\nsystems for which an analytical calculational scheme is available. The\nutilization of quantum correlations in quantum information-based applications\nis limited by the problem of decoherence, i.e., the loss of coherence due to\nthe inevitable interaction of a quantum system with its environment. The\ndynamics of quantum correlations due to decoherence may be studied in the Kraus\noperator formalism for different types of quantum channels representing\nsystem-environment interactions. In this review, we describe the salient\nfeatures of the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations in a two-qubit\nsystem under Markovian (memoryless) time evolution. The two-qubit state\nconsidered is described by the reduced density matrix obtained from the ground\nstate of a spin model. The models considered include the transverse-field XY\nmodel in one dimension, a special case of which is the transverse-field Ising\nmodel, and the $XXZ$ spin chain. The quantum channels studied include the\namplitude damping, bit-flip, bit-phase-flip and phase-flip channels. The Kraus\noperator formalism is briefly introduced and the origins of different types of\ndynamics discussed. One can identify appropriate quantities associated with the\ndynamics of quantum correlations which provide signatures of quantum phase\ntransitions in the spin models. Experimental observations of the different\ntypes of dynamics are also mentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 07:17:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 06:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

It is well known that radiative levitation of individual\nelements can lead to their accumulation in specific stellar layers. In some\ncases, it can induce important effects on the stellar structure. Here we\nconfirm that this accumulation is moderated by thermohaline convection due to\nthe resulting inverse $\\mu$-gradient. The new coefficient that we have derived\nshows that the effect of radiative accelerations on the thermohaline\ninstability itself is small. This effect must however be checked in all\ncomputations.

That is, more or less data can be transmitted per time depending on\nthe signal quality, which is determined by the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Each wireless link has a\nutility function mapping SINR values to the respective data rates. We have to\ndecide which transmissions are performed simultaneously and (depending on the\nproblem variant) also which transmission powers are used.\n  In the capacity-maximization problem, one strives to maximize the overall\nnetwork throughput, i.e., the summed utility of all links. For arbitrary\nutility functions (not necessarily continuous ones), we present an O(log\nn)-approximation when having n communication requests. This algorithm is built\non a constant-factor approximation for the special case of the respective\nproblem where utility functions only consist of a single step. In other words,\neach link has an individual threshold and we aim at maximizing the number of\nlinks whose threshold is satisfied. On the way, this improves the result in\n[Kesselheim, SODA 2011] by not only extending it to individual thresholds but\nalso showing a constant approximation factor independent of assumptions on the\nunderlying metric space or the network parameters.\n  In addition, we consider the latency-minimization problem. Here, each link\nhas a demand, e.g., representing an amount of data. We have to compute a\nschedule of shortest possible length such that for each link the demand is\nfulfilled, that is the overall summed utility (or data transferred) is at least\nas large as its demand. Based on the capacity-maximization algorithm, we show\nan O(log^2 n)-approximation for this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 10:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

Even without taking this excess emission into account as a\npossible dust component, higher dust-to-gas mass ratios (DGR) are often\nobserved compared to that expected from their metallicity for moderately\nmetal-poor galaxies.\n  The SEDs of the lowest metallicity galaxies, however, give very low dust\nmasses and excessively low values of DGR, inconsistent with the amount of\nmetals expected to be captured into dust if we presume the usual linear\nrelationship holding for all metallicities, including the more metal-rich\ngalaxies.

We present here an analysis of the most extreme case detected\nso far, the RRab star V445 Lyr (KIC 6186029) which was observed with the Kepler\nspace mission. V445 Lyr shows very strong cycle-to-cycle changes in its Blazhko\nmodulation, which are caused both by a secondary long-term modulation period as\nwell as irregular variations. In addition to the complex Blazhko modulation,\nV445 Lyr also shows a rich spectrum of additional peaks in the frequency range\nbetween the fundamental pulsation and the first harmonic. Among those peaks,\nthe second radial overtone could be identified, which, combined with a\nmetallicity estimate of [Fe/H]=-2.0 dex from spectroscopy, allowed to constrain\nthe mass (0.55-0.65 M_sun) and luminosity (40-50 L_sun) of V445 Lyr through\ntheoretical Petersen diagrams. A non-radial mode as well as possibly the first\novertone are also excited. Furthermore, V445 Lyr shows signs of the period\ndoubling phenomenon and a long term period change. A detailed Fourier analysis\nalong with a study of the O-C variation of V445 Lyr is presented, and the\norigin of the additional peaks and possible causes of the changes in the\nBlazhko modulation are discussed.

A continuous model of a quantum refrigerator is employed\nconsisting of a working medium composed either by two coupled harmonic\noscillators or two coupled 2-level systems.

Therefore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is much\nhigher than of previously reported reputation mechanisms, which rely on emails\nlogs. In addition, the proposed method, when used for updating both the black\nand white lists, eliminated the need in automatic content inspection of 4 out\nof 5 incoming emails, which resulted in dramatic reduction in the filtering\ncomputational load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 12:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

The effectiveness of\nBargmann rule is shown to be equivalent to an averaging procedure over the\nunobservable degrees of freedom of the central extension of Galileo group.\nMoreover, viewing the Galileian invariant quantum mechanics as a\nnon-relativistic limit, we prove that the above-mentioned averaging procedure\ngiving rise to Bargmann superselection rule is nothing but an effective\nde-coherence phenomenon due to time evolution if assuming that real\nmeasurements includes a temporal averaging procedure.

The momentum splitting\nof these bands is not affected by adsorbate-induced changes in the surface\npotential. These findings demonstrate that two properties crucial for enabling\nsemiconductor-based spin electronics -- a large, robust spin splitting and\nambipolar conduction -- are present in this material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 14:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

Previous theoretical studies have shown that faster moving cells\nfavor synchronization across a population of locally coupled genetic\noscillators. An important assumption in these studies is that cells can\nimmediately interact with their new neighbors after arriving at a new location.\nHowever, intercellular interactions in cellular systems may need some time to\nbecome fully established. How movement affects synchronization in this\nsituation has not been examined. Here we develop a coupled phase oscillator\nmodel in which we consider cell movement and the gradual recovery of\nintercellular coupling experienced by a cell after movement, characterized by a\nmoving rate and a coupling recovery rate respectively. We find (1) an optimal\nmoving rate for synchronization, and (2) a critical moving rate above which\nachieving synchronization is not possible. These results indicate that the\nextent to which movement enhances synchrony is limited by a gradual recovery of\ncoupling. These findings suggest that the ratio of time scales of movement and\nsignaling recovery is critical for information transfer between moving cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 15:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-09"}

With a series of $N$-body simulations, we study the\ndynamical evolution of single massive clusters and those that are assembled\nthrough merging smaller clusters together. We find that the formation of\nmassive star clusters through the mergers of smaller clusters can reproduce the\ncurrently observed spatial distribution of massive stars, the density, and the\ncharacteristics (number and mass distribution) of the stars ejected as runaways\nfrom young dense clusters. We therefore conclude that these clusters and\npossibly other young massive star clusters formed through the mergers of\nsmaller clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 15:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We\nshow how the multitude of \"related observables\" obtained from B -> K^* l^+ l^-,\ncan provide many new \"clean tests\" of the Standard Model. The hallmark of these\ntests is that several of them are independent of the unknown universal form\nfactors in heavy quark effective theory. We derive a relation between\nobservables that is free of form factors and Wilson coefficients, the violation\nof which will be an unambiguous signal of New Physics. We also derive relations\nbetween observables and form factors that are independent of Wilson\ncoefficients and enable verification of hadronic estimates.

If we make three basic\nassumptions, we can show that the distributions over ontic states corresponding\nto distinct pure states are non-overlapping. This means that we can deduce the\nquantum state from a knowledge of the ontic state. Hence, if these assumptions\nare correct, we can claim that the quantum state is a real thing (it is written\ninto the underlying variables that describe reality). The key assumption we use\nin this proof is ontic indifference - that quantum transformations that do not\naffect a given pure quantum state can be implemented in such a way that they do\nnot affect the ontic states in the support of that state. In fact this\nassumption is violated in the Spekkens toy model (which captures many aspects\nof quantum theory and in which different pure states of the model have\noverlapping distributions over ontic states).
