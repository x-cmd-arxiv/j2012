The model is an extension of the popular Stahl Model, which is\nwidely used in the literature. The extension introduces sellers with\nheterogeneous stores number, reflecting the typical market structure. The\nmarket consists of several sellers heterogeneous in size consumers, some of\nwhich face a cost when sequentially searching. The paper shows that no\nsymmetric model exist in the extension and asymmetric NE of the Stahl model are\nfound for comparison. Additional results suggest that smallest sellers will be\nthe ones offering lowest prices, in line with several real world examples\nprovided in the paper. However, profits remain in most cases fixed per store,\nmaking a larger firm more profitable, yet with lower sold quantity. The\nfindings suggest that on some level price dispersion will still exist, together\nwith some level of price stickiness, both observed in reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2012 16:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

This ground state plays\nan important role in the mathematical treatment of recent experiments on the\nphenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation, and in the study of various types of\nsolutions of nonhomogeneous defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equations. Many of\nthese applications require delicate estimates for the behavior of the ground\nstate near the boundary of the condensate, as the singular parameter tends to\nzero, in the vicinity of which the ground state has irregular behavior in the\nform of a steep corner layer. In particular, the role of this layer is\nimportant in order to detect the presence of vortices in the small density\nregion of the condensate, understand the superfluid flow around an obstacle,\nand also has a leading order contribution in the energy.

This settles an open\nproblem, answered very recently only for the special case of the model harmonic\npotential.

From the resulting Hamiltonian,\nthe velocity and time of flight of relativistic distant particles at Planck\nenergy can be derived. A first comparison is made with recent observations for\nHubble parameter in redshift-dependence in early-type galaxies. We find that\nLIV has two types of contributions to the time of flight delay $\\Delta t$\ncomparable with that observations. Although the wrong OPERA measurement on\nfaster-than-light muon neutrino anomaly, $\\Delta t$, and the relative change in\nthe speed of muon neutrino $\\Delta v$ in dependence on redshift $z$ turn to be\nwrong, we utilize its main features to estimate $\\Delta v$.

Fixing the sensitivity factor and its\nenergy dependence are essential inputs for a reliable confronting of our\ncalculations to UHECR. The sensitivity factor is related to the special time of\nflight delay and the time structure of the signal.

The compactness of AM CVn\norbits and their unusual chemical composition make these systems valuable\ntestbeds for outburst models. We aim for a better understanding of the role of\nhelium in the accretion disc instability mechanism, testing the model for dwarf\nnovae outbursts in the case of AM CVn stars, and aim to explain the outburst\nlight-curves of these ultra-compact binaries. We calculated the properties of\nthe hydrogen-free AM CVn stars using our previously developed numerical code\nadapted to the different chemical composition of these systems and supplemented\nwith formulae accounting for mass transfer rate variations, additional sources\nof the disc heating, and the primary's magnetic field. We discovered how\nhelium-dominated discs react to the thermal-viscous instability and were able\nto reproduce various features of the outburst cycles in the light-curves of AM\nCVn stars. The AM CVn outbursts can be explained by the suitably adapted\ndwarf-nova disc instability model but, as in the case of its application to\nhydrogen-dominated cataclysmic variables, one has to resort to additional\nmechanisms to account for the observed superoutbursts, dips, cycling states,\nand standstills. We show that the enhanced mass-transfer rate, due presumably\nto variable irradiation of the secondary, must not only be taken into account\nbut is a determining factor that shapes AM CVn star outbursts. The cause of the\nvariable secondary's irradiation has yet to be understood; the best candidate\nis the precession of a tilted/warped disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2012 20:27:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 10:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-20"}

The\ntemperature of an optically thick accretion disc is determined by the energy\nbalance between the viscous heating and the radiative cooling. The radiative\ncooling rate depends on the opacity of the disc. The opacity is expressed as a\nfunction of the temperature. We find the disc is divided into three regions\nthat have different temperature distributions. The slope of the entropy\ndistribution becomes steep in the inner region of the disc with the high\ntemperature and the outer region of the disc with the low temperature, while it\nbecomes shallow in the middle region with the intermediate temperature. Planets\nin the inner and outer regions move outward owing to the large positive\ncorotation torque exerted on the planet by an adiabatic disc, on the other\nhand, a planet in the middle region moves inward toward the central star.\nPlanets are expected to accumulate at the boundary between the inner and middle\nregions of the adiabatic disc. The positive corotation torque decreases with an\nincrease in the viscosity of the disc.

It harvests energy from its environment (say, for example, through a\nsolar cell) and uses this energy for the purpose of communicating with the\nestimator. Due to the randomness of energy available for communication, the\nsensor may not be able to communicate all the time. The sensor may also want to\nsave its energy for future communications. The estimator relies on messages\ncommunicated by the sensor to produce real-time estimates of the source state.\nWe consider the problem of finding a communication scheduling strategy for the\nsensor and an estimation strategy for the estimator that jointly minimize an\nexpected sum of communication and distortion costs over a finite time horizon.\nOur goal of joint optimization leads to a decentralized decision-making\nproblem. By viewing the problem from the estimator's perspective, we obtain a\ndynamic programming characterization for the decentralized decision-making\nproblem that involves optimization over functions.

However, since dust dynamics\nis size-dependent (because of gas-drag or radiation pressure) any attempt to\nunderstand the full dynamical evolution of circumstellar dusty-disks that\nneglect the coupling of collisional evolution with dynamical evolution is\nthwarted because of the feedback between these two processes. Here, a new\nhybrid lagrangian/eulerian code is presented that overcomes some of these\ndifficulties. The particles representing \"dust-clouds\" are tracked individually\nin a lagrangian way. This system is then mapped on an eulerian spatial grid,\ninside the cells of which the local collisional evolutions are computed.\nFinally, the system is remapped back in a collection of discrete lagrangian\nparticles keeping constant their number. An application example on dust growth\nin a turbulent protoplanetary disk at 1 AU is presented. First the growth of\ndust is considered in the absence of a dead-zone and the vertical distribution\nof dust is self-consistently computed. It is found that the mass is rapidly\ndominated by particles about a fraction of millimeter in size. Then the same\ncase with an embedded dead-zone is investigated and It is found that\ncoagulation is much more efficient and produces, in a short time scale,\n1cm-10cm dust pebbles that dominate the mass.

Diffusion as a stochastic\nprocess of an overdamped individual particle immersed in a fluid, initiated by\nEinstein, Smoluchowski, Langevin and Wiener, has no momentum since its path is\nnowhere differentiable. In this exposition, we illustrate how analytical\nmechanics arises in stochastic dynamics from a randomly perturbed ordinary\ndifferential equation $dX_t=b(X_t)dt+\\epsilon dW_t$ where $W_t$ is a Brownian\nmotion. In the limit of vanishingly small $\\epsilon$, the solution to the\nstochastic differential equation other than $\\dot{x}=b(x)$ are all rare events.\nHowever, conditioned on an occurence of such an event, the most probable\ntrajectory of the stochastic motion is the solution to Lagrangian mechanics\nwith $\\mathcal{L}=\\|\\dot{q}-b(q)\\|^2/4$ and Hamiltonian equations with\n$H(p,q)=\\|p\\|^2+b(q)\\cdot p$. Hamiltonian conservation law implies that the\nmost probable trajectory for a \"rare\" event has a uniform \"excess kinetic\nenergy\" along its path. Rare events can also be characterized by the principle\nof large deviations which expresses the probability density function for $X_t$\nas $f(x,t)=e^{-u(x,t)/\\epsilon}$, where $u(x,t)$ is called a large-deviation\nrate function which satisfies the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Our calculation\nsuggests that the heavy fermion behavior around x=0.5 comes from the\ncooperative effects between moderately strong Coulomb interaction compared to\nthe total bandwidth and the modification of the electronic structures due to\nthe rotation of RuO_{6} octahedra (i.e., the variation of the $dp\\pi$\nhybridizations and the downward shift for the $d_{xy}$ orbital). We propose\nthat moderately strong electron correlation and the orbital-dependent\nmodifications of the electronic structures due to the lattice distortions play\nimportant roles in the electronic states for Ca_{2-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{4}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 08:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 11:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

Classical treatment\nof the translational atomic motion provides the semiclassical\nHamilton-Schrodinger equations which are a 5D nonlinear dynamical system with\ntwo integrals of motion. The atomic dynamics can be regular or chaotic in\ndependence on values of the control parameters, the atom-field detuning and\nrecoil frequency. We develop a semiclassical theory of the chaotic atomic\ntransport in terms of a random walk of the atomic electric dipole moment $u$.\nBased on a jump-like behavior of this variable for atoms crossing nodes of the\nstanding wave, we construct a stochastic map that specifies the center-of-mass\nmotion. We find the relations between the detuning, recoil frequency and the\natomic energy, under which atoms may move in a optical lattice in a chaotic\nway. We obtain the analytical conditions under which deterministic atomic\ntransport has fractal properties and explain a hierarchical structure of the\ndynamical fractals. Quantum treatment of the atomic motion in a standing wave\nis studied in the dressed state picture where the atom moves in two optical\npotentials simultaneously. If the values of the detuning and a characteristic\natomic frequency are of the same order, than there is a probability of\nnonadiabatic transitions of the atom upon crossing nodes of the standing wave.\nAt the same condition exactly, we observe sudden jumps in the atomic dipole\nmoment $u$ when the atom crosses the nodes. Those jumps are accompanied by\nsplitting of atomic wave packets at the nodes. Such a proliferation of wave\npackets at the nodes of a standing wave is a manifestation of classical atomic\nchaotic transport. At large values of the detuning, the quantum evolution is\nshown to be adiabatic in accordance with a regular character of the classical\natomic motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 11:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-29"}
