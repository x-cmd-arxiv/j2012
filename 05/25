One of the most important\nissues for any MCMC method is the convergence of the Markov chain, which\ndepends crucially on a suitable choice of the proposal density. Adaptive\nRejection Metropolis Sampling (ARMS) is a well-known MH scheme that generates\nsamples from one-dimensional target densities making use of adaptive piecewise\nproposals constructed using support points taken from rejected samples. In this\nwork we pinpoint a crucial drawback in the adaptive procedure in ARMS: support\npoints might never be added inside regions where the proposal is below the\ntarget. When this happens in many regions it leads to a poor performance of\nARMS, with the proposal never converging to the target. In order to overcome\nthis limitation we propose two improved adaptive schemes for constructing the\nproposal. The first one is a direct modification of the ARMS procedure that\nincorporates support points inside regions where the proposal is below the\ntarget, while satisfying the diminishing adaptation property, one of the\nrequired conditions to assure the convergence of the Markov chain. The second\none is an adaptive independent MH algorithm with the ability to learn from all\nprevious samples except for the current state of the chain, thus also\nguaranteeing the convergence to the invariant density. These two new schemes\nimprove the adaptive strategy of ARMS, thus simplifying the complexity in the\nconstruction of the proposals. Numerical results show that the new techniques\nprovide better performance w.r.t. the standard ARMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 16:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 May 2012 00:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 10:39:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 17:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

We study the evolution of three alternative\ninitial data schemes. Two of the three alternatives are based on post-Newtonian\nexpansions that contain realistic gravitational waves. The first scheme is\nbased on a second-order post-Newtonian expansion in Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner\ntransverse-traceless (ADMTT) gauge that has been resummed to approach standard\npuncture data at the black holes. The second scheme is based on asymptotic\nmatching of the 4-metrics of two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a\nfirst-order post-Newtonian expansion in ADMTT gauge away from the black holes.\nThe final alternative is obtained through asymptotic matching of the 4-metrics\nof two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a second-order\npost-Newtonian expansion in harmonic gauge away from the black holes. When\nevolved, the second scheme fails to produce quasicircular orbits (and instead\nleads to a nearly head-on collision). This failure can be traced back to\ninaccuracies in the extrinsic curvature due to low order matching. More\nencouraging is that the latter two alternatives lead to quasicircular orbits\nand show gravitational radiation from the onset of the evolution, as well as a\nreduction of spurious radiation. Current deficiencies compared to standard\npunctures data include more eccentric trajectories during the inspiral and\nlarger constraint violations, since the alternative data sets are only\napproximate solutions of Einstein's equations.

A particularly important subset of these will be what we call basic\nlayered surfaces. We can alter these surface by performing the entirely local\noperations of adding handles and/or crosscaps, each of which increases genus.\n  The main result then shows that if we are given an alternating projection\nP(L) and a surface S spanning L, we can construct a surface T spanning L with\nthe same genus, orientability, and aggregate slope as S that is a basic layered\nsurface with respect to P, except perhaps at a collection of added crosscaps\nand/or handles. Furthermore, S must be connected if L is non-splittable. This\nresult has several useful corollaries. In particular, it allows for the\ndetermination of nonorientable genus for alternating links. It also can be used\nto show that mutancy of alternating links preserves nonorientable genus.

Recent research, however, documents the great\ndegree to which student thinking is dynamic and context-sensitive, implicitly\ncalling for explanations not only of change but also of stability. In other\nwords: When a pattern of student reasoning is sustained in specific moments and\nsettings, what mechanisms contribute to sustaining it? We characterize student\nunderstanding and behavior in terms of multiple local coherences in that they\nmay be variable yet still exhibit local stabilities. We attribute stability in\nlocal conceptual coherences to real-time activities that sustain these\ncoherences. For example, particular conceptual understandings may be stabilized\nby the linguistic features of a worksheet question, or by feedback from the\nstudents' spatial arrangement and orientation. We document a group of\nuniversity students who engage in multiple local conceptual coherences while\nthinking about motion during a collaborative learning activity. As the students\nshift their thinking several times, we describe mechanisms that may contribute\nto local stability of their reasoning and behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 19:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

By a theorem of Ichino and a lemma of Michel--Venkatesh, this amounts to\na detailed study of Rankin--Selberg integrals int|f|^2 E attached to newforms f\nof arbitrary level and Eisenstein series E of full level.\n  We find that the local factors of such integrals participate in many amusing\nanalogies with global L-functions.

This calculation includes the\ngas-phase and dust grain formation of H2, shielding of HI and H2, and\nphotodissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation from nearby stellar\npopulations. Because this model does not assume equilibrium abundances, it is\nparticularly well suited for simulations that model low-metallicity\nenvironments, such as dwarf galaxies and the early Universe.

This\ninitial plan is used to form a set of dose constraints, and a set of\npartial-arc plans is created by searching the space of all possible partial-arc\nplans that satisfy these constraints. For each partial-arc, an iterative\nfluence map merging and sequencing algorithm (vmerge) is used to improve the\ndelivery efficiency. Merging continues as long as the dose quality is\nmaintained above a user-defined threshold. The final plan is selected as the\npartial arc with the lowest treatment time.

However, many probabilistic retrieval models\nrely on fixing one representation and optimizing the other (e.g. fixing the\nsingle information need and tuning the document) but not both. Therefore, it is\ndifficult to use the available related information on both the document and the\nquery at the same time in calculating the probability of relevance. In this\npaper, we address the problem by hypothesizing the relevance as a logical\nrelationship between the two sets of properties; the relationship is defined on\ntwo separate mappings between these properties. By using the hypothesis we\ndevelop a unified probabilistic relevance model which is capable of using all\nthe available information. We validate the proposed theory by formulating and\ndeveloping probabilistic relevance ranking functions for both ad-hoc text\nretrieval and collaborative filtering. Our derivation in text retrieval\nillustrates the use of the theory in the situation where no relevance\ninformation is available. In collaborative filtering, we show that the\nresulting recommender model unifies the user and item information into a\nrelevance ranking function without applying any dimensionality reduction\ntechniques or computing explicit similarity between two different users (or\nitems), in contrast to the state-of-the-art recommender models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 20:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 01:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 18:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-04"}

The error term could be directly observed as a\nresponse or \\emph{estimated} from a functional parametric model, like for\ninstance the functional linear regression. Our test is based on the remark that\nchecking the no-effect of the functional covariate is equivalent to checking\nthe nullity of the conditional expectation of the error term given a\nsufficiently rich set of projections of the covariate.

Under special circumstances, a\nsubspace of the system's Hilbert space remains coherent, or \"decoherence free\",\nand the reduced density matrix approaches a non-trivial limit which contains\ninformation on its initial quantum state, despite the coupling to the\nenvironment. This situation is called \"partial decoherence\". Here we find the\nconditions for partial decoherence for a mesoscopic system (with $N$ quantum\nstates) which is coupled to an environment. When the Hamiltonian of the system\ncommutes with the total Hamiltonian, one has \"adiabatic decoherence\", which\nyields N-1 time-independent combinations of the reduced density matrix\nelements. In the presence of a magnetic flux, one can measure circulating\ncurrents around loops in the system even at long times, and use them to\nretrieve information on the initial state. For N=2, we demonstrate that partial\ndecoherence can happen only under adiabatic decoherence conditions. However,\nfor $N>2$ we find partial decoherence even when the Hamiltonian of the system\ndoes not commute with the total Hamiltonian, and we obtain the general\nconditions for such non-adiabatic partial decoherence. For an electron moving\non a ring, with $N>2$ single-level quantum dots, non-adiabatic partial\ndecoherence can arise only when the total flux through the ring vanishes (or\nequals an integer number of flux quanta), and therefore there is no asymptotic\ncirculating current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 07:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Methods: We\nhave used high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from three different\nspectrographs. We used the iterative spectral synthesis method VWA to derive\nthe fundamental parameters from carefully selected high-quality iron lines.\nAfter determination of the fundamental parameters, abundances of 13 elements\nwere measured using equivalent widths of the spectral lines.

Both stars came out to be Sun-like with an age\nof about 100-200 Myr, based on their lithium content and kinematics. Their\nyouth is confirmed by the high level of chromospheric activity, comparable to\nthat displayed by the early G-type stars in the Pleiades cluster.

Poor reconciliation\nefficiency, revealing more information than strictly needed, may compromise the\nmaximum attainable distance, while poor performance of the algorithm limits the\npractical throughput in a QKD device. Historically, reconciliation has been\nmainly done using close to minimal information disclosure but heavily\ninteractive procedures, like Cascade, or using less efficient but also less\ninteractive -just one message is exchanged- procedures, like the ones based in\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The price to pay in the LDPC case is\nthat good efficiency is only attained for very long codes and in a very narrow\nrange centered around the quantum bit error rate (QBER) that the code was\ndesigned to reconcile, thus forcing to have several codes if a broad range of\nQBER needs to be catered for. Real world implementations of these methods are\nthus very demanding, either on computational or communication resources or\nboth, to the extent that the last generation of GHz clocked QKD systems are\nfinding a bottleneck in the classical part. In order to produce compact, high\nperformance and reliable QKD systems it would be highly desirable to remove\nthese problems.

Some of the spectral data were also\ninterpreted as evidence of fast (~100-300 km/s) quasi-periodic flows. We have\nperformed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) modeling of a bipolar\nAR that contains impulsively generated waves and flows in coronal loops. The\nmodel AR is initiated with a dipole magnetic field and gravitationally\nstratified density, with an upflow driven steadily or periodically in localized\nregions at the footpoints of magnetic loops. The resulting flows along the\nmagnetic field lines of the AR produce higher density loops compared to the\nsurrounding plasma by injection of material into the flux-tubes and the\nestablishment of siphon flow. We find that the impulsive onset of flows with\nsubsonic speeds result in the excitation of damped slow magnetosonic waves that\npropagate along the loops and coupled nonlinearly driven fast mode waves. The\nphase speed of the slow magnetosonic waves is close to the coronal sound speed.\nWhen the amplitude of the driving pulses is increased we find that slow\nshock-like wave trains are produced. When the upflows are driven periodically,\nundamped oscillations are produced with periods determined by the periodicity\nof the upflows. Based on the results of the 3D MHD model we suggest that the\nobserved slow magnetosonic waves and persistent upflows may be produced by the\nsame impulsive events at the bases of ARs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 15:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We provide exact\nmicro-canonical calculations for both models and we show that the classical\ncounting of polyhedra accounts for most of the features of the intertwiner\ncounting (leading order entropy and log-correction), thus providing us with a\nsimpler model to further investigate correlations and dynamics.

Methods: We use the\nself-consistent nuclear density functional theory employing Skyrme and Gogny\nenergy density functionals. Results: The potential energy surfaces in\nmulti-dimensional space of collective coordinates, including elongation,\ntriaxiality, reflection-asymmetry, and necking, are calculated for 180 Hg and\n198 Hg. The asymmetric fission valleys - well separated from fusion valleys\nassociated with nearly spherical fragments - are found in in both cases.
