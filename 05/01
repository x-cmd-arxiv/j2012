Two\nmodels based on the Bloch-McConnell (B-M) and the Bloch-Torrey (B-T) equations\nare commonly used for modelling the physical processes which determine the NMR\nlineshapes. Qualitative arguments for each of the two methods can be found in\nvarious studies in the literature. However, there is a lack of systematic\nquantitative investigations of the diffusive exchange spectra calculated with\nthe two methods for the same physical system or model. In this work exact\nfrequency-domain transverse magnetization solutions of the B-M and the B-T\nequations with boundary conditions for a two-compartment radial diffusive\nexchange model are presented. Theoretical spectra and the two corresponding\nmetrics were computed by varying three different parameters: diffusive\npermeability of the separating membrane between the two compartments (P), the\nradius of the inner spherical compartment (a), and the chemical shift between\nthe two compartments (\\Deltaf). In general, the two models predicted different\nspectral broadening for the same parameters in agreement with the different\nanalytical solutions. However, the numerical analysis of the spectral\nbroadening demonstrated that the two models converge to the same results in the\nlimit of large chemical shift on the scale of the exchange rate. The results\nwere qualitatively interpreted based on the difference between the two models:\nthe B-M model assumes a single average exchange time constant while the B-T\nmodel implies a more realistic continuous distribution of diffusive exchange\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 16:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}

Chromatic clustering seeks to\npartition a set of colored points into groups (or clusters) so that no group\ncontains points with the same color and a certain objective function is\noptimized. In this paper, we consider two variants of the problem, chromatic\n$k$-means clustering (denoted as $k$-CMeans) and chromatic $k$-medians\nclustering (denoted as $k$-CMedians), and investigate their hardness and\napproximation solutions. For $k$-CMeans, we show that the additional coloring\nconstraint destroys several key properties (such as the locality property) used\nin existing $k$-means techniques (for ordinary points), and significantly\ncomplicates the problem.

Given a\nset of points $P$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ space, projective clustering is to find a\nset $\\mathbb{F}$ of $k$ lower dimensional $j$-flats so that the average\ndistance (or squared distance) from points in $P$ to their closest flats is\nminimized. Existing approaches for this problem are mainly based on\nadaptive/volume sampling or core-sets techniques which suffer from several\nlimitations. In this paper, we present the first uniform random sampling based\napproach for this challenging problem and achieve linear time solutions for\nthree cases, general projective clustering, regular projective clustering, and\n$L_{\\tau}$ sense projective clustering. For the general projective clustering\nproblem, we show that for any given small numbers $0<\\gamma, \\epsilon <1$, our\napproach first removes $\\gamma|P|$ points as outliers and then determines $k$\n$j$-flats to cluster the remaining points into $k$ clusters with an objective\nvalue no more than $(1+\\epsilon)$ times of the optimal for all points. For\nregular projective clustering, we demonstrate that when the input points\nsatisfy some reasonable assumption on its input, our approach for the general\ncase can be extended to yield a PTAS for all points. For $L_{\\tau}$ sense\nprojective clustering, we show that our techniques for both the general and\nregular cases can be naturally extended to the $L_{\\tau}$ sense projective\nclustering problem for any $1 \\le \\tau < \\infty$. Our results are based on\nseveral novel techniques, such as slab partition, $\\Delta$-rotation, symmetric\nsampling, and recursive projection, and can be easily implemented for\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 18:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 05:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The difference between\nthe ongoing, instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at DAZ white dwarfs, which\noften exceed 1e8 g/s, and those inferred over the past 1e5-1e6 yr for the DBZ\nstars can be a few orders of magnitude, and therefore must result from\nhigh-rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected to\ndate.

This is unambiguous evidence in support of ongoing, low-level\nstar formation in at least some cluster elliptical galaxies, and illustrates\nthat galaxies that appear to be quiescent cannot be assumed to host only Type\nIa SNe. Based on this single SNII we make the first measurement of the SNII\nrate in red sequence galaxies, and find it to be 0.007 (+0.014 -0.007 stat;\n+0.009 -0.001 sys) SNe per century per 1e10 solar masses.

These values agree with SFRs measured from\ninfrared and ultraviolet photometry, and H-alpha emission from optical\nspectroscopy. Additionally, we use the SFR derived from our SNII rate to show\nthat although a small fraction of cluster Type Ia SNe may originate in the\nyoung stellar population and experience a short delay time, these results do\nnot preclude the use of cluster SNIa rates to derive the late-time delay time\ndistribution for SNeIa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Infrared (IR)\nobservations may advance our understanding of the accretion flows in LLAGN, the\nfate of the obscuring torus at low accretion rates, and, perhaps, the star\nformation histories of these objects. However, while comprehensively studied in\nhigher-luminosity Seyferts and quasars, the nuclear IR properties of LLAGN have\nnot yet been well-determined. We separate the present LLAGN sample into three\ncategories depending on their Eddington ratio and radio emission, finding\ndifferent IR characteristics for each class. (I) At the low-luminosity,\nlow-Eddington ratio (log Lbol/LEdd < -4.6) end of the sample, we identify\n\"host-dominated\" galaxies with strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bands\nthat may indicate active (circum-)nuclear star formation. (II) Some very\nradio-loud objects are also present at these low Eddington ratios. The IR\nemission in these nuclei is dominated by synchrotron radiation, and some are\nlikely to be unobscured type 2 AGN that genuinely lack a broad line region.\n(III) At higher Eddington ratios, strong, compact nuclear sources are visible\nin the MIR images. The nuclear SEDs of these galaxies are diverse; some\nresemble typical Seyfert nuclei, while others lack a well-defined MIR \"dust\nbump\". Strong silicate emission is present in many of these objects. We\nspeculate that this, together with high ratios of silicate strength to hydrogen\ncolumn density, could suggest optically thin dust and low dust-to-gas ratios,\nin accordance with model predictions that LLAGN do not host a Seyfert-like\nobscuring torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 20:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This is the first exact algorithm that runs in time\nsingly-exponential in $r$. This algorithm (and earlier algorithms) are built on\nmethods for finding a solution to a system of polynomial inequalities (if one\nexists). Notably, the best algorithms for this task run in time exponential in\nthe number of variables but polynomial in all of the other parameters (the\nnumber of inequalities and the maximum degree).\n  Hence these algorithms motivate natural algebraic questions whose solution\nhave immediate {\\em algorithmic} implications: How many variables do we need to\nrepresent the decision problem, does $M$ have nonnegative rank at most $r$? A\nnaive formulation uses $nr + mr$ variables and yields an algorithm that is\nexponential in $n$ and $m$ even for constant $r$. (Arora, Ge, Kannan, Moitra,\nSTOC 2012) recently reduced the number of variables to $2r^2 2^r$, and here we\nexponentially reduce the number of variables to $2r^2$ and this yields our main\nalgorithm.

Routing\nunder limited information and the possibility of cascades through the network\nadds serious challenges to this problem. This abstract considers the framework\nof dynamical networks introduced in our earlier work [1,2], where the network\nis modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations derived from mass\nconservation laws on directed acyclic graphs with a single origin-destination\npair and a constant inflow at the origin. The rate of change of the particle\ndensity on each link of the network equals the difference between the inflow\nand the outflow on that link. The latter is modeled to depend on the current\nparticle density on that link through a flow function. The novel modeling\nelement in this paper is that every link is assumed to have finite capacity for\nparticle density and that the flow function is modeled to be strictly\nincreasing as density increases from zero up to the maximum density capacity,\nand is discontinuous at the maximum density capacity, with the flow function\nvalue being zero at that point. This feature, in particular, allows for the\npossibility of spill-backs in our model. In this paper, we present our results\non resilience of such networks under distributed routing, towards perturbations\nthat reduce link-wise flow functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 02:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-02"}

The large spatial extent of the broad, shocked emission\ncomponent is generally inconsistent with an origin in the narrow-line region of\na AGN, so we conclude that energy and momentum supplied by the starburst drives\nthese outflows. The new data are used to examine the fraction of the supernova\nenergy radiated by shocks and the mass loss rate in the warm-ionized phase of\nthe wind. We show that the shocks produced by galactic outflows can be\nrecognized in moderately high-resolution, integrated spectra of these nearby,\nultraluminous starbursts. The spectral fitting technique introduced in Paper I\nmay therefore be used to improve the accuracy of the physical properties\nmeasured for high-redshift galaxies from their (observed frame) infrared\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 04:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The Lorentz law is the\nuniversal expression of the force exerted by electromagnetic fields on a volume\ncontaining a distribution of electrical charges and currents. If electric and\nmagnetic dipoles also happen to be present in a material medium, they are\ntraditionally treated by expressing the corresponding polarization and\nmagnetization distributions in terms of bound-charge and bound-current\ndensities, which are subsequently added to free-charge and free-current\ndensities, respectively.

This paper presents incontrovertible\ntheoretical evidence of the incompatibility of the Lorentz law with the\nfundamental tenets of special relativity.

The\nkey to understand this absorbing phenomenon is to characterize the decaying\ntime of the fittest class of the population. Adaptive landscape introduced by\nWright, a re-emerging powerful concept in systems biology, is used as a tool to\ndescribe biological processes. To our knowledge, the dynamical behaviors for\nMuller's ratchet over the full parameter regimes are not studied from the point\nof the adaptive landscape.

The adaptive\nlandscape has rich structures such as finite and infinite potential, real and\nimaginary fixed points. We give the formula about the single click time with\nfinite and infinite potential. And we find the single click time increases with\nselection rates and population size increasing, decreases with mutation rates\nincreasing. These results provide a new understanding of infinite potential. We\nanalytically demonstrate the adaptive and unadaptive states for the whole\nparameters regimes. Interesting issues about the parameters regions with the\nimaginary fixed points is demonstrated. This can help understand the biological\nmeaning of the critical points such as the intersection points of regimes.

In hard\nreal-time systems, a significant disparity exists EDF-based schemes and RMA\nscheduling (which is the only known way of optimally scheduling recurrent\nreal-time tasks on multiprocessors): on M processors, all known EDF variants\nhave utilization-based schedulability bounds of approximately M/2, while RMA\nalgorithms can fully utilize all processors. This is unfortunate because EDF\nbased algorithms entail lower scheduling and task migration overheads. In work\non hard real-time systems, it has been shown that this disparity in\nSchedulability can be lessened by placing caps on per task utilizations. Our\nmain contribution is a new EDF based scheme that ensures bounded deadline\ntardiness. In this scheme, per-task utilizations must be focused,but overall\nutilization need not be stricted. Our scheme should enable a wide range of soft\nreal-time applications to be scheduled with no constraints on total\nutilization. Also propose techniques and heuristics that can be used to reduce\ntardiness as well as increase the efficiency of task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 09:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-02"}

Good agreement is found for the pressure in the semi-quark gluon plasma\n(QGP), which is the region from Tc, the critical temperature, to about ~4 Tc.\nAbove ~1.2 Tc, the pressure is a sum of a perturbative term, ~ +T^4, and a\nsimple non-perturbative term, essentially just a constant times ~ -Tc^2 T^2.\nFor the pressure, the details of the matrix model only enter within a very\nnarrow window, from Tc to ~1.2 Tc, whose width does not change significantly\nwith N.

The Swift/Burst Alert Telescope all-sky survey provides\nan unbiased, flux-limited selection of hard X-ray detected AGN.\nCross-correlating the 22-month hard X-ray survey with the AKARI all-sky survey,\nwe studied 158 AGN detected by the AKARI instruments. We find a strong\ncorrelation for most AGN between the infrared (9, 18, and 90 micron) and hard\nX-ray (14-195 keV) luminosities, and quantify the correlation for various\nsubsamples of AGN. Partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsic\ncorrelation after removing the redshift contribution. The correlation for radio\ngalaxies has a slope and normalization identical to that for Seyfert 1s,\nimplying similar hard X-ray/infrared emission processes in both. In contrast,\nCompton-thick sources show a large deficit in the hard X-ray band, because high\ngas column densities diminish even their hard X-ray luminosities.

Combined with\noptical data, a minimum of five and a maximum of eleven different metals are\ndetected in their photospheres. With metal sinking time scales of only a few\ndays, these stars are in accretion/diffusion equilibrium, and the photospheric\nabundances closely reflect those of the circumstellar material. We find C/Si\nratios that are consistent with that of the bulk Earth, corroborating the rocky\nnature of the debris. Their C/O values are also very similar to those of bulk\nEarth, implying that the planetary debris is dominated by Mg and Fe silicates.\nThe abundances found for the debris at the four white dwarfs show substantial\ndiversity, comparable at least to that seen across different meteorite classes\nin the solar system. PG0843+516 exhibits significant over-abundances of Fe and\nNi, as well as of S and Cr, which suggests the accretion of material that has\nundergone melting, and possibly differentiation.

Robinson's hyperreals, while providing a consistent\ntheory of infinitesimals, require the resources of modern logic; thus many\ncommentators are comfortable denying a historical continuity. A notable\nexception is Robinson himself, whose identification with the Leibnizian\ntradition inspired Lakatos, Laugwitz, and others to consider the history of the\ninfinitesimal in a more favorable light. Inspite of his Leibnizian sympathies,\nRobinson regards Berkeley's criticisms of the infinitesimal calculus as aptly\ndemonstrating the inconsistency of reasoning with historical infinitesimal\nmagnitudes. We argue that Robinson, among others, overestimates the force of\nBerkeley's criticisms, by underestimating the mathematical and philosophical\nresources available to Leibniz. Leibniz's infinitesimals are fictions, not\nlogical fictions, as Ishiguro proposed, but rather pure fictions, like\nimaginaries, which are not eliminable by some syncategorematic paraphrase. We\nargue that Leibniz's defense of infinitesimals is more firmly grounded than\nBerkeley's criticism thereof. We show, moreover, that Leibniz's system for\ndifferential calculus was free of logical fallacies. Our argument strengthens\nthe conception of modern infinitesimals as a development of Leibniz's strategy\nof relating inassignable to assignable quantities by means of his\ntranscendental law of homogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 14:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-02"}

Van Vleck from his 1926 Bulletin for the\nNational Research Council (NRC) on the old quantum theory to his 1932 book, The\nTheory of Electric and Magnetic Susceptibilities. We highlight the continuity\nof formalism and technique in the transition from dealing with spectra in the\nold quantum theory to dealing with susceptibilities in the new quantum\nmechanics. Our main focus is on the checkered history of a numerical factor in\nthe Langevin-Debye formula for the electric susceptibility of gases. Classical\ntheory predicts that this factor is equal to 1/3. The old quantum theory\npredicted values up to 14 times higher. Van Vleck showed that quantum mechanics\ndoes away with this \"wonderful nonsense\" (as Van Vleck called it) and restores\nthe classical value 1/3. The Langevin-Debye formula thus provides an\ninstructive example of a Kuhn loss in one paradigm shift that was regained in\nthe next. In accordance with Kuhn's expectation that textbooks sweep Kuhn\nlosses under the rug, Van Vleck did not mention this particular Kuhn loss\nanywhere in his 1926 NRC Bulletin (though he prominently did flag a Kuhn loss\nin dispersion theory that had recently been regained). Contrary to Kuhn's\nexpectations, however, he put the regained Kuhn loss in susceptibility theory\nto good pedagogical use in his 1932 book. Kuhn claimed that textbooks must\nsuppress, truncate, and/or distort the prehistory of their subject matter if\nthey are to inculcate the exemplars of the new paradigm in their readers. This\nclaim is not borne out in this case. Because of the continuity of formalism and\ntechnique that we draw attention to that Van Vleck could achieve his\npedagogical objectives in his 1932 book even though he devoted about a third of\nit to the treatment of susceptibilities in classical theory and the old quantum\ntheory in a way that matches the historical record reasonably well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 14:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-02"}

Coupled with\nan analytical derivation of the critical switching current based on the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, and the write error rate derived from a\nsolution to the Fokker-Planck equation, this model provides us a quick estimate\nof the energydelay- reliability tradeoffs in perpendicular STTRAMs due to\nthermal fluctuations. In other words, the model provides a simple way to\ncalculate the energy consumed during a write operation that ensures a certain\nerror rate and delay time, while being numerically far less intensive than a\nfull-fledged stochastic calculation. We calculate the worst case energy\nconsumption during anti-parallel (AP) to parallel (P) and P to AP switchings\nand quantify how increasing the anisotropy field HK and lowering the saturation\nmagnetization MS, can significantly reduce the energy consumption.

In previous work, we presented a novel algorithm that\nallows the BWT of human genome scale data to be computed on very moderate\nhardware, thus enabling us to investigate the BWT as a tool for the compression\nof such datasets.\n  Results\n  We first used simulated reads to explore the relationship between the level\nof compression and the error rate, the length of the reads and the level of\nsampling of the underlying genome and compare choices of second-stage\ncompression algorithm.\n  We demonstrate that compression may be greatly improved by a particular\nreordering of the sequences in the collection and give a novel `implicit\nsorting' strategy that enables these benefits to be realised without the\noverhead of sorting the reads. With these techniques, a 45x coverage of real\nhuman genome sequence data compresses losslessly to under 0.5 bits per base,\nallowing the 135.3Gbp of sequence to fit into only 8.2Gbytes of space (trimming\na small proportion of low-quality bases from the reads improves the compression\nstill further).\n  This is more than 4 times smaller than the size achieved by a standard\nBWT-based compressor (bzip2) on the untrimmed reads, but an important further\nadvantage of our approach is that it facilitates the building of compressed\nfull text indexes such as the FM-index on large-scale DNA sequence collections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 15:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 11:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

This relationship\ncan be expressed as $N_r(t_{rest})=(\\frac{\\ell^2m_\\phi^2\\Lambda}{4\\pi\nG\\sigma^2(t_{rest})})^{3/2}$ when we employ the classical chaotic model,\n$V(\\phi)=1/2m_{\\phi}^2\\phi^2$, and consider that $\\phi$ comes to rest at\n$t_{rest}$. Moreover, we obtain an evolution equation for the particle number\n($N_r(t)$) inside the comoving volume. Meanwhile, a new inflaton field equation\nwhich contains parameters of $N_r(t)$ and \"particle creation coefficients\" can\nalso be found. Importantly, the results illustrate the fact that $\\Lambda$ and\n$N_r$ are the results of probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 17:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-07"}
