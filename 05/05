However,\nDRMG suffers from inherent accuracy restrictions when multiple states are\ninvolved due to multi-state targeting and also the approximate representation\nof the Hamiltonian and other operators. By formulating the variational approach\nof DMRG explicitly for MPSs one can avoid errors inherent in the multi-state\ntargeting approach. Furthermore, by using the Matrix Product Operator (MPO)\nformalism, one can exactly represent the Hamiltonian and other operators. The\nMPO approach allows 1D Hamiltonians to be templated using a small set of finite\nstate automaton rules without reference to the particular microscopic degrees\nof freedom. We present two algorithms which take advantage of these properties:\neMPS to find excited states of 1D Hamiltonians and tMPS for the time evolution\nof a generic time-dependent 1D Hamiltonian. We properly account for\ntime-ordering of the propagator such that the error does not depend on the rate\nof change of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithms use only the MPO form of the\nHamiltonian, and so are applicable to microscopic degrees of freedom of any\nvariety, and do not require Hamiltonian-specialized implementation. We\nbenchmark our algorithms with a case study of the Ising model, where the\ncritical point is located using entanglement measures. We then study the\ndynamics of this model under a time-dependent quench of the transverse field\nthrough the critical point. Finally, we present studies of a dipolar, or\nlong-range Ising model, again using entanglement measures to find the critical\npoint and study the dynamics of a time-dependent quench through the critical\npoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 18:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

The simulation begins with a twisted flux\nrope emerging at the lower boundary and pushing into a pre-existing coronal\npotential arcade field. At a chosen time the emergence is stopped with the\nlower boundary taken to be rigid. Then the coronal flux rope settles into a\nquasi-static rise phase during which an underlying, central sigmoid-shaped\ncurrent layer forms along the so called hyperbolic flux tube (HFT), a\ngeneralization of the X-line configuration. Reconnections in the dissipating\ncurrent layer effectively add twisted flux to the flux rope and thus allow it\nto rise quasi-statically, even though the magnetic energy is decreasing as the\nsystem relaxes. We examine the thermal features produced by the current layer\nformation and the associated \"tether-cutting\" reconnections as a result of\nheating and field aligned thermal conduction. It is found that a central hot,\nlow-density channel containing reconnected, twisted flux threading under the\nflux rope axis forms on top of the central current layer. When viewed in the\nline of sight roughly aligned with the hot channel (which is roughly along the\nneutral line), the central current layer appears as a high-density vertical\ncolumn with upward extensions as a \"U\" shaped dense shell enclosing a central\nhot, low-density void. Such thermal features have been observed within coronal\nprominence cavities. Our MHD simulation suggests that they are the signatures\nof the development of the HFT topology and the associated tether-cutting\nreconnections, and that the central void grows and rises with the\nreconnections, until the flux rope reaches the critical height for the onset of\nthe torus instability and dynamic eruption ensues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 18:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 23:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The dislocations\nare represented by points in a plane, and they are arranged in vertical walls;\neach wall is free to move in the horizontal direction. The system is described\nby a discrete energy depending on the one-dimensional horizontal positions of\nthe n walls; the energy contains contributions from repulsive pairwise\ninteractions between all walls, a global shear stress forcing the walls to the\nleft, and a pinned wall at x=0 that prevents the walls from leaving through the\nleft boundary.\n  We study the behaviour of the energy as the number n of walls tends to\ninfinity, and characterise this behaviour in terms of Gamma-convergence. There\nare five different cases, depending on the asymptotic behaviour of a single\ndimensionless parameter. As a consequence we obtain characterisations of the\nlimiting behaviour of stationary states in each of these five regimes.\n  The results shed new light on the open problem of upscaling large numbers of\ndislocations. We show how various existing upscaled models arise as special\ncases of the theorems of this paper. The wide variety of behaviour suggests\nthat upscaled models should incorporate more information than just dislocation\ndensities. This additional information is encoded in the limit of the\ndimensionless parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 19:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

One proposed signature of oceans is\nspecular reflection (\"glint\"), which increases the apparent albedo of a planet\nat crescent phases. We post-process a global climate model of an Earth-like\nplanet to simulate reflected lightcurves. Significantly, we obtain glint-like\nphase variations even though we do not include specular reflection in our\nmodel. This false positive is the product of two generic properties: 1) for\nmodest obliquities, a planet's poles receive less orbit-averaged stellar flux\nthan its equator, so the poles are more likely to be covered in highly\nreflective snow and ice, and 2) we show that reflected light from a\nmodest-obliquity planet at crescent phases probes higher latitudes than at\ngibbous phases, therefore a planet's apparent albedo will naturally increase at\ncrescent phase. We suggest that this \"latitude-albedo effect\" will operate even\nfor large obliquities: in that case the equator receives less orbit-averaged\nflux than the poles, and the equator is preferentially sampled at crescent\nphase. Using rotational and orbital color variations to map the surfaces of\ndirectly imaged planets and estimate their obliquity will therefore be a\nnecessary pre-condition for properly interpreting their reflected phase\nvariations. The latitude-albedo effect is a particularly convincing glint false\npositive for zero-obliquity planets, and such worlds are not amenable to\nlatitudinal mapping.

In this\npaper, we reconstruct the distribution of mass in the COSMOS field out to a\nredshift z=1 by combining Hubble Space Telescope weak lensing measurements with\nzCOSMOS spectroscopic measurements of galaxy clustering. The distribution of\ngalaxies traces the distribution of mass with high resolution (particularly in\nredshift, which is not possible with lensing), and the lensing data empirically\ncalibrates the mass normalisation (bypassing the need for theoretical models).\nTwo steps are needed to convert a galaxy survey into a density field. The first\nstep is to create a smooth field from the galaxy positions, which is a point\nfield. We investigate four possible methods for this: (i) Gaussian smoothing,\n(ii) convolution with truncated isothermal sphere, (iii) fifth nearest\nneighbour smoothing and (iv) a muliti-scale entropy method. The second step is\nto rescale this density field using a bias prescription. We calculate the\noptimal bias scaling for each method by comparing predictions from the smoothed\ndensity field with the measured weak lensing data, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.\nIn general, we find scale-independent bias for all the smoothing schemes, to a\nprecision of 10%. For the nearest neighbour smoothing case, we find the bias to\nbe 2.51\\pm 0.25. We also find evidence for a strongly evolving bias, increasing\nby a factor of ~3.5 between redshifts 0<z<0.8. We believe this strong evolution\ncan be explained by the fact that we use a flux limited sample to build the\ndensity field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 20:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This technique is orders of magnitude\nmore sensitive than other methods, allowing detections of star formation to\n10^(-5) Msun/yr. Ongoing star formation is detected in all galaxies, including\nthree ellipticals that have previously exhibited potential signposts of star\nforming conditions (NGC 4636, NGC 4697, and NGC 4374), as well as the typical\n\"red and dead\" NGC 3379. The current star formation in our closest targets,\nwhere we are most complete, is between 1-8x10^(-5) Msun/yr.

The specific star formation rates of ~10^(-16)\nyr^(-1) (at the present day) or ~10^(-14) yr^(-1) (when averaging over the past\nGyr) imply that a fraction 10^(-8) of the stellar mass is younger than 100 Myr\nand 10^(-5) is younger than 1 Gyr, quantifying the level of frosting of recent\nstar formation over the otherwise passive stellar population.

This is the\nfirst clear detection of a bridge associated both with an outlying cluster\nrelic and X-ray diffuse emission. All the indicators point toward the\nsynchrotron bridge being related to the post-shock turbulent wake trailing the\nshock front generated by a major merger in a massive cluster. Although\npredicted by simulations, this is the first time such emission is detected with\nhigh significance and clearly associated with the path of a confirmed shock.\nAlthough the origin of the relativistic electrons is still unknown, the\nturbulent re-acceleration model provides a natural explanation for the\nlarge-scale emission.

Other highlights include: a surprising connection with total\npositivity and cluster algebras; results on the inverse problem; and the\ncharacterization of regular soliton solutions -- that is, a soliton solution\nu_A(x,y,t) is regular for all times t if and only if A comes from the totally\nnon-negative part of the Grassmannian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 May 2012 05:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

One can slightly reorganize the set of\ngraphs obtained in the B-side, so that it coincides with the one obtained by\nlocalization in the A-model.Then it suffices to compare the weights of vertices\nand edges of graphs on each side, which is done in 2 steps: the weights\ncoincide in the large radius limit, due to the fact that the toric graph is the\ntropical limit of the mirror curve.

A composite likelihood approach based on\nthe bivariate distribution of block maxima has been recently proposed in the\nliterature. However modeling block maxima is a wasteful approach provided that\nother information is available. Moreover an approach based on block, typically\nannual, maxima is unable to take into account the fact that maxima occur or not\nsimultaneously. If time series of, say, daily data are available, then\nestimation procedures based on exceedances of a high threshold could mitigate\nsuch problems. In this paper we focus on two approaches for composing\nlikelihoods based on pairs of exceedances.

The events were selected with low latency by the network\nof GW detectors and their candidate sky locations were observed by the Swift\nobservatory. Image transient detection was used to analyze the collected\nelectromagnetic data, which were found to be consistent with background.\nOff-line analysis of the GW data alone has also established that the selected\nGW events show no evidence of an astrophysical origin; one of them is\nconsistent with background and the other one was a test, part of a \"blind\ninjection challenge\". With this work we demonstrate the feasibility of rapid\nfollow-ups of GW transients and establish the sensitivity improvement joint\nelectromagnetic and GW observations could bring. This is a first step toward an\nelectromagnetic follow-up program in the regime of routine detections with the\nadvanced GW instruments expected within this decade. In that regime\nmulti-wavelength observations will play a significant role in completing the\nastrophysical identification of GW sources.

To counter this, we introduce an additional design criterion, that\nwe call rakeness, accounting for the amount of energy that the measurements\ncapture from the signal to be acquired. Hence, for localized signals a proper\nsystem tuning increases the rakeness as well as the average SNR of the samples\nused in its reconstruction. Yet, maximizing average SNR may go against the need\nof capturing all the components that are potentially non-zero in a sparse\nsignal, i.e., against the restricted isometry requirement ensuring\nreconstructability. What we propose is to administer the trade-off between\nrakeness and restricted isometry in a statistical way by laying down an\noptimization problem. The solution of such an optimization problem is the\nstatistic of the process generating the random waveforms onto which the signal\nis projected to obtain the measurements. The formal definition of such a\nproblems is given as well as its solution for signals that are either localized\nin frequency or in more generic domain.
