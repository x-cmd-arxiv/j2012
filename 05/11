The amount of variability in different classes of Active Galactic\nNuclei has been studied extensively but many questions remain unanswered. We\npresent the results of a long-term programme to investigate the intra-night\noptical variability (INOV) of powerful flat spectrum radio core-dominated\nquasars (CDQs), with a focus on probing the relationship of INOV to the degree\nof optical polarization. We observed a sample of 16 bright CDQs showing strong\nbroad optical emission lines and consisting of both high and low optical\npolarization quasars (HPCDQs and LPCDQs). We employed ARIES, IIA, IGO\ntelescopes, to carry out {\\it R}-band monitoring on a total of 47 nights.\nCombining these INOV data with those taken from the literature, we were able to\nincrease the sample size to 21 CDQs(12 LPCDQs and 9 HPCDQs) monitored on a\ntotal of 73 nights. As the existence of a prominent flat-spectrum radio core\nsignifies that strong relativistic beaming is present in all these CDQs, the\ndefinitions of the two sets differ primarily in fractional optical\npolarization, the LPCDQs showing a very low median$ P_{op} \\simeq$ 0.4 per\ncent.\n  Our study yields an INOV duty cycle (DC) of $\\sim$28 per cent for the LPCDQs\nand $\\sim 68$ percent for HPCDQs.\n  If only strong INOV with fractional amplitude above 3 per cent is considered,\nthe corresponding DCs are $\\sim$ 7 per cent and $\\sim$ 40 per cent,\nrespectively.From this strong contrast between the two classes of luminous,\nrelativistically beamed quasars, it is apparent that relativistic beaming is\nnormally not a sufficient condition for strong INOV and a high optical\npolarization is the other necessary condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 17:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We present oxygen and iron abundance\ndistributions of SN II progenitor regions that avoid many previous sources of\nbias. Because Fe (rather than O) abundance drives the late stage evolution of\nthe massive stars that are the progenitors of CCSNe, and because Fe enrichment\nlags O enrichment, we find a general conversion from O abundance to Fe\nabundance. The distributions we present here are the best yet standard of\ncomparison for evaluating how rare classes of SNe depend on progenitor\nmetallicity. We measure the gas-phase O abundance of a representative subsample\nof the hosts of SNe II from the first-year PTF SN search, using a combination\nof SDSS spectra near the SN location (9) and new long slit spectroscopy (25).\nThe median metallicity of these 34 hosts is 12+log(O/H) = 8.65, with a median\nerror of 0.09. The median host galaxy stellar mass from fits to SDSS photometry\nis 10^9.9 solar masses. They do not show a systematic offset in metallicity or\nmass from a redshift-matched sample of the MPA/JHU value-added catalog. In\ncontrast to previous SN host metallicity studies, this sample is drawn from a\nsingle, areal survey. SNe in the lowest-mass galaxies are not systematically\nexcluded.

As primary source of seed\nphotons for inverse Compton scattering, we consider radiation from the broad\nline region (BLR), from the molecular torus, and the local synchrotron\nradiation (SSC). Different scenarios are assessed by comparing simulated light\ncurves and SEDs with one of the best flares by PKS1510-089, in March 2009. The\ntime-dependence of our code and its correct handling of light travel time\neffects allow us to fully take into account the effect of the finite size of\nthe active region, and in turn to fully exploit the information carried by time\nresolved observed SEDs, increasingly available since the launch of Fermi.

An important model system is the enzyme\ndihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from E. coli, which exhibits characteristic\nconformational changes of the active-site loop during the catalytic step and\nduring unbinding of the product. In this article, we present a general kinetic\nframework that can be used (1) to identify the ordering of events in the\ncoupling of conformational changes, binding and catalysis and (2) to determine\nthe rates of the substeps of coupled processes from a combined analysis of NMR\nR2 relaxation dispersion experiments and traditional enzyme kinetics\nmeasurements. We apply this framework to E. coli DHFR and find that the\nconformational change during product unbinding follows a\nconformational-selection mechanism, i.e. the conformational change occurs\npredominantly prior to unbinding. The conformational change during the\ncatalytic step, in contrast, is an induced change, i.e. the change occurs after\nthe chemical reaction. We propose that the reason for these conformational\nchanges, which are absent in human and other vertebrate DHFRs, is robustness of\nthe catalytic rate against large pH variations and changes to substrate/product\nconcentrations in E. coli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 19:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-11"}

New Herschel observations are used to\nestimate warm and cold dust masses, a lower-limit gas-to-dust ratio, and a star\nformation rate consistent with previous measurements. The cooling time profile\nof the ambient X-ray atmosphere is used to map the locations of the\nobservational star formation entropy threshold as well as the theoretical\nthermal instability threshold. Both lie just outside the < 30 kpc central\nregion permeated by X-ray cavities, and star formation as well as ionized and\nmolecular gas lie interior to both. The young stars are distributed in an\nelongated region that is aligned with the radio lobes, and their estimated ages\nare both younger and older than the X-ray cavity network, suggesting both\njet-triggered as well as persistent star formation over the current AGN\nfeedback episode. Bright X-ray knots that are coincident with extended Ly-alpha\nand FUV continuum filaments motivate a discussion of structured cooling from\nthe ambient hot atmosphere along a projected axis that is perpendicular to\nX-ray cavity and radio axis. We conclude that the cooling ICM is the dominant\ncontributor of the cold gas reservoir fueling star formation and AGN activity\nin the Abell 2597 BCG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-11"}

The problem of measuring both the\ngeneral direction and polarization of an electromagnetic source is commonly\nsolved by iterative fitting methods such as linear regression that deal\nsimultaneously with both directional and polarization parameters. We have\ndeveloped a scheme that separates the problem of deriving the source direction\nfrom that of determining the polarization, avoiding iteration in a\nmulti-dimensional manifold. The crux of the method is to first determine the\nsource direction independently of concerns as to its polarization. Once the\nsource direction is known, its direct characterization in terms of Stokes\nvectors in a single iteration if desired, is relatively simple. This study\napplies the source-direction determination to radio signatures of flares\nreceived by STEREO. We studied two previously analyzed radio type III bursts\nand found that the results of the eigenvalue decomposition technique are\nconsistent with those obtained previously by Reiner et al.

For the type III burst observed on 7 December 2007, the difference\nin travel times from the derived source location to STEREO A and B is the same\nas the difference in the onset times of the burst profiles measured by the two\nspacecraft. This is consistent with emission originating from a single,\nrelatively compact source. For the second event of 29 January 2008, the\nrelative timing does not agree, suggesting emission from two sources separated\nby 0.1 AU, or perhaps from an elongated region encompassing the apparent source\nlocations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 21:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}

The interest\nis in detecting a group effect. When the observations are vectorial,\nreal-valued and follow a multivariate Normal distribution, multivariate\nanalysis of variance (MANOVA) tests are routinely applied. However, such\ntraditional procedures are not suitable when dealing with more complex data\nstructures such as functional (e.g. curves) or graph-structured (e.g. trees and\nnetworks) objects, where the required distributional assumptions may be\nviolated. In this paper we discuss a distance-based MANOVA-like approach, the\nDBF test, for detecting differences between groups for a wider range of data\ntypes. The test statistic, analogously to other distance-based statistics, only\nrelies on a suitably chosen distance measure that captures the pairwise\ndissimilarity among all available samples. An approximate null probability\ndistribution of the DBF statistic is proposed thus allowing inferences to be\ndrawn without the need for costly permutation procedures. Through extensive\nsimulations we provide evidence that the proposed methodology works well for a\nrange of data types and distances, and generalizes the traditional MANOVA\ntests. We also report on an application of the proposed methodology for the\nanalysis of a multi-locus genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease,\nwhich has been carried out using several genetic distance measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 01:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}

However, achieving this in a\ncircuit implementation is complicated by the number of wires required to\nexchange messages between processing nodes. Decoding algorithms that exchange\nbinary messages are interesting for fully-parallel implementations because they\ncan reduce the number and the length of the wires, and increase logic density.\nThis paper introduces the Relaxed Half-Stochastic (RHS) decoding algorithm, a\nbinary message belief propagation (BP) algorithm that achieves a coding gain\ncomparable to the best known BP algorithms that use real-valued messages. We\nderive the RHS algorithm by starting from the well-known Sum-Product algorithm,\nand then derive a low-complexity version suitable for circuit implementation.\nWe present extensive simulation results on two standardized codes having\ndifferent rates and constructions, including low bit error rate results. These\nsimulations show that RHS can be an advantageous replacement for the existing\nstate-of-the-art decoding algorithms when targeting fully-parallel\nimplementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 05:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}

The small semimajor axes\nof the three planets suggest that migration stopped at the inner edge of the\nprimordial gas disk. In this paper we focus on the influence of migration\nhalting mechanisms, including migration \"dead zones\", and inner truncation by\nthe stellar magnetic field. We show that the stellar accretion rate, stellar\nmagnetic field and the speed of migration in the proto-planetary disk are the\nmain factors affecting the final configuration of KOI-152.

In MANETs a mobile node operates as not only end terminal but also\nas an intermediate router.

The asymptotic Hamiltonian yields two types of\nasymptotic waves; one is an approximate Coulomb wave with $\\rho$ in the\nmiddle-range region, and the other a free (no-Coulomb) wave in the\nlongest-range region. The constant Wronskians of this Hamiltonian can be\ncalculated in either region.

Under constant force, the logarithm of the residence time at the\nstable and metastable oscillator rest position is proportional to $(F-F_c)$ as\nin an Arrhenius law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 07:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-06"}

We consider a linear precoding\nscheme in a MIMO relaying broadcast channel with quantized CSI feedback from\nboth two-hop links. With this scheme, each remote user feeds back its quantized\nCSI to the relay, and the relay sends back the quantized precoding information\nto the base station (BS). An upper bound on the rate loss due to quantized\nchannel knowledge is first characterized. Then, in order to maintain the rate\nloss within a predetermined gap for growing SNRs, a strategy of scaling\nquantization quality of both two-hop links is proposed. It is revealed that the\nnumbers of feedback bits of both links should scale linearly with the transmit\npower at the relay, while only the bit number of feedback from the relay to the\nBS needs to grow with the increasing transmit power at the BS.

A bi-flat $F$-manifold is given by the following data $(M,\n\\nabla_1,\\nabla_2,\\circ,*,e,E)$, where $(M, \\circ)$ is an $F$-manifold, $e$ is\nthe identity of the product $\\circ$, $\\nabla_1$ is a flat connection compatible\nwith $\\circ$ and satisfying $\\nabla_1 e=0$, while $E$ is an eventual identity\ngiving rise to the dual product *, and $\\nabla_2$ is a flat connection\ncompatible with * and satisfying $\\nabla_2 E=0$. Moreover, the two connections\n$\\nabla_1$ and $\\nabla_2$ are required to be hydrodynamically almost equivalent\nin the sense specified in [2].\n  First we show that, similarly to the way in which Frobenius manifolds are\nconstructed starting from Darboux-Egorov systems, also bi-flat $F$-manifolds\ncan be built from solutions of suitably augmented Darboux-Egorov systems,\nessentially dropping the requirement that the rotation coefficients are\nsymmetric.\n  Although any Frobenius manifold possesses automatically the structure of a\nbi-flat $F$-manifold, we show that the latter is a strictly larger class. In\nparticular we study in some detail bi-flat $F$-manifolds in dimensions n=2, 3.\nFor instance, we show that in dimension 3 bi-flat $F$-manifolds are\nparametrized by solutions of a two parameters Painlev\\'e VI equation, admitting\namong its solutions hypergeometric functions. Finally we comment on some open\nproblems of wide scope related to bi-flat $F$-manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 09:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 15:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 11:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The SM singlet added to the Higgs sector\nconnects the PQ and visible sectors through a PQ-invariant non-renormalizable\nK\\\"ahler potential term, making the model free from the tadpole and domain-wall\nproblems. For the case that the lightest Higgs boson is dominated by the\nsinglet scalar, the Higgs mixing increases the mass of a SM-like Higgs boson\nwhile reducing its signal rate at collider experiments compared to the SM case.\nThe Higgs mixing is important also in the region of parameter space where the\nNMSSM contribution to the Higgs mass is small, but its size is limited by the\nexperimental constraints on the singlet-like Higgs boson and on the lightest\nneutralino constituted mainly by the singlino whose Majorana mass term is\nforbidden by the PQ symmetry. Nonetheless the Higgs mixing can increase the\nSM-like Higgs boson mass by a few GeV or more even when the Higgs signal rate\nis close to the SM prediction, and thus may be crucial for achieving a 125 GeV\nHiggs mass, as hinted by the recent ATLAS and CMS data.

Contrary to nonlinear harmonic generation, harmonic lasing can\nprovide much more intense, stable, and narrow-band FEL beam which is easier to\nhandle due to the suppressed fundamental frequency. In this paper we perform a\nparametrization of the solution of the eigenvalue equation for lasing at odd\nharmonics, and present an explicit expression for FEL gain length, taking into\naccount all essential effects. We propose and discuss methods for suppression\nof the fundamental harmonic. We also suggest a combined use of harmonic lasing\nand lasing at the retuned fundamental wavelength in order to reduce bandwidth\nand to increase brilliance of X-ray beam at saturation. Considering 3rd\nharmonic lasing as a practical example, we come to the conclusion that it is\nmuch more robust than usually thought, and can be widely used in the existing\nor planned X-ray FEL facilities. In particular, LCLS after a minor modification\ncan lase to saturation at the 3rd harmonic up to the photon energy of 25-30 keV\nproviding multi-gigawatt power level and narrow bandwidth. As for the European\nXFEL, harmonic lasing would allow to extend operating range (ultimately up to\n100 keV), to reduce FEL bandwidth and to increase brilliance, to enable\ntwo-color operation for pump-probe experiments, and to provide more flexible\noperation at different electron energies. Finally, in this paper we discover\nthat in a part of the parameter space, corresponding to the operating range of\nsoft X-ray beamlines of X-ray FEL facilities (like SASE3 beamline of the\nEuropean XFEL), harmonics can grow faster than the fundamental wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 12:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The highest correlation coefficient is obtained for the\nrelation of the CME peak velocity and the total energy in accelerated electrons\n(c = 0.85), supporting the idea that the acceleration of the CME and the\nparticle acceleration in the associated flare draw their energy from a common\nsource, probably magnetic reconnection in the current sheet behind the erupting\nstructure. In general, the CME peak velocity shows somewhat higher correlations\nwith the non-thermal flare parameters than the CME peak acceleration, except\nfor the spectral index of the accelerated electron spectrum which yields a\nhigher correlation with the CME peak acceleration (c = -0.6), indicating that\nthe hardness of the flare-accelerated electron spectrum is tightly coupled to\nthe impulsive acceleration process of the rising CME structure.

However, it has recently been suggested, on the basis of\nX-ray-optical scaling relations of galaxies in the field and the group/cluster\nenvironment, that confinement pressure by the intra-cluster medium can actually\nlead to an increase in the mass of hot gas surrounding these galaxies. We\ninvestigate the competition between pressure confinement and ram pressure\nstripping for satellite galaxies in orbit about galaxy groups and clusters\nusing simple analytic models and detailed cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations. It is found that, independent of host mass, ram pressure is\ngenerally dominant over confinement pressure --- only ~16 % of galaxies find\nthemselves in the reverse situation. Furthermore, these galaxies have, on\naverage, less hot gas than ram-pressure dominated ones, contrary to simple\nexpectations. This is explained by the fact that the small number of galaxies\nwhich are confinement dominated are typically at first or second apocentre and\nhave therefore already been maximally affected by ram pressure stripping around\nfirst pericentre. Our results are shown to be insensitive to host halo mass; we\nargue that the same is true for uncertain sub-grid processes, such as feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 15:12:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 13:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper we use the HST/COS data from a massive\nmulti-wavelength monitoring campaign on the bright Seyfert I galaxy Mrk 509, in\ncombination with archival HST/STIS data, to constrain the location of the\nvarious kinematic components of the outflow. We compare the expected response\nof the photoionized gas to changes in ionizing flux with the changes measured\nin the data using the following steps: 1) We compare the column densities of\neach kinematic component measured in the 2001 STIS data with those measured in\nthe 2009 COS data; 2) We use time-dependent photionization calculations with a\nset of simulated lightcurves to put statistical upper limits on the hydrogen\nnumber density that are consistent with the observed small changes in the ionic\ncolumn densities; 3) From the upper limit on the number density, we calculate a\nlower limit on the distance to the absorber from the central source via the\nprior determination of the ionization parameter. Our method offers two\nimprovements on traditional timescale analysis. First, we account for the\nphysical behavior of AGN lightcurves. Second, our analysis accounts for the\nquality of measurement in cases where no changes are observed in the absorption\ntroughs.

We define the notion of\nFisher Tensor and show that its anti-symmetric part is intrinsically related to\nthe Kostant Kirillov Souriau symplectic form that is naturally defined on\nco-adjoint orbits, while the symmetric part is nontrivially again represented\nby the Fubini Study metric on the space of mixed states, weighted by the mixing\ncoefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 15:55:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 06:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 09:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-14"}

This\nmodel seems to propose the principles and conceptual foundations leading to a\nunified picture of fermions, and may reduce the standard theory to a far\nsimpler form. The model suggests describing leptons and quarks as\nquasi-excitations, while electromagnetic and strong interactions as secondary\ninteractions mediated by Nambu-Goldstone bosons originating from spontaneous\nviolations of global SU(2) and rotational symmetries. Both the possibility of\nobserving Lorentz-violating phenomena and their magnitudes are discussed.
