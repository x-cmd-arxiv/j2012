This\ncorresponds with a highly complicated \"band structure\" problem in AdS, which we\nonly manage to solve in the weak potential limit. The \"domain wall\" fermions in\nAdS encoding for the Fermi surfaces in the boundary field theory diffract as\nusually against the periodic lattice, giving rise to band gaps.

The hybridization\nof the fermions bulk dualizes into a linear combination of CFT1 \"local quantum\ncritical\" propagators in the bulk, characterized by momentum dependent\nexponents displaced by lattice Umklapp vectors.

While a consensus is emerging about the origin and\ngrowth of supermassive black holes (with masses larger than a billion solar\nmasses), MBHs with smaller masses, such as the one in our galactic centre,\nremain understudied and enigmatic. The key to understanding these holes - how\nsome of them grow by orders of magnitude in mass - lies in understanding the\ndynamics of the stars in the galactic neighbourhood. Stars interact with the\ncentral MBH primarily through their gradual inspiral due to the emission of\ngravitational radiation. Also stars produce gases which will subsequently be\naccreted by the MBH through collisions and disruptions brought about by the\nstrong central tidal field. Such processes can contribute significantly to the\nmass of the MBH and progress in understanding them requires theoretical work in\npreparation for future gravitational radiation millihertz missions and X-ray\nobservatories.

We obtain a \"phase diagram\" of the system as a function of binary\nparameters, showing regimes in which both the disk structure and migration have\na different character. Although massive binaries can create a central gap in\nthe disk at large radii, the tidal barrier of the secondary causes a\nsignificant pile-up of gas outside of its orbit, which can lead to the closing\nof the gap. We find that this spillover occurs at an orbital separation as\nlarge as ~200 M_7^{-1/2} gravitational radii, where M = 10^7 M_7 Msun is the\ntotal binary mass. If the secondary is less massive than ~10^6 Msun, then the\ngap is closed before gravitational waves (GWs) start dominating the orbital\ndecay. In this regime, the disk is still strongly perturbed, but the piled-up\ngas continuously overflows as in a porous dam, and crosses inside the\nsecondary's orbit. The corresponding migration rate, which we label Type 1.5,\nis slower than the usual limiting cases known as Type I and II migration.\nCompared to an unperturbed disk, the steady-state disk in the overflowing\nregime is up to several hundred times brighter in the optical bands.

Yet, spectral libraries that include the near-IR\nwavelength range do not sample a sufficiently broad range of ages and\nmetallicities to allow for accurate calibration of stellar population models\nand thus the interpretation of the observations. In this paper we investigate\nthe integrated J- and H-band spectra of six intermediate age (1-3 Gyr) and old\n(>10 Gyr) globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using observations\nobtained with the SINFONI IFU at the VLT. H-band C2 and K-band 12CO(2-0)\nfeature strengths are compared to the models of Maraston (2005). C2 is\nreasonably well reproduced by the models at all ages, while 12CO(2-0) shows\ngood agreement for older (age>2 Gyr) populations, but the younger (1.3 Gyr)\nglobular clusters do not follow the models. We argue that this is due to the\nfact that the empirical calibration of the models relies on only a few Milky\nWay carbon star spectra, which show different 12CO(2-0) index strengths than\nthe LMC stars. The C2 absorption feature strength correlates strongly with age.\nIt is present essentially only in populations that have 1-2 Gyr old stars,\nwhile its value is consistent with zero for older populations. The distinct\nspectral energy distribution observed for the intermediate age globular\nclusters in the J- and H-bands agrees well with the model predictions of\nMaraston for the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant\nbranch phase (TP-AGB).

The tidal stream around HCC 007 extends\nover at least 110 kpc. It is fairly thick and is brighter on the side of the\nasymmetric outer halo of NGC 3311, which it may join. Its luminosity is several\n10^9 L_sun, similar to the luminosity of the stripped-down galaxy HCC 007. The\nredshift of the stream is determined from a few PN velocities and is similar to\nthat for HCC 007 and HCC 026.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 20:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 08:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In the\npresent paper the low-temperature properties of two-dimensional ideal\nferromagnets are analyzed within the model-independent method of effective\nLagrangians. The low-temperature expansion of the partition function is\nevaluated up to two-loop order and the general structure of this series is\ndiscussed, including the effect of a weak external magnetic field.

For sources in group 1, the CRSF energy is negatively\ncorrelated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, the\nopposite behavior is observed. The physical basis for this bimodal behavior is\ncurrently not understood. We explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamics\nin the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellar\nsurface, and that Coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group\n2 sources. We derive a new expression for the critical luminosity such that\nradiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in the supercritical sources.\nThe formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for 5 sources, using the\nmaximum value of the CRSF centroid energy to estimate the surface magnetic\nfield strength.

It is, by far, the only data with the highest signal\nstatistic in 0.4 -- 10 keV range. Despite being able to reproduce the X-ray\nspectrum, Comptonization of the disk photons failed to give a physically\nmeaningful solution. A modified version of the multi-color disk model, in which\nthe dependence of the disk temperature on the radius is described as r^(-p)\nwith p being a free parameter, can also approximate the spectrum. From this\nmodel, the innermost disk temperature and bolometric luminosity were obtained\nas T_in = 2.00-0.05+0.06 keV and L_disk = 1.36 x 10^39 (cos i)^(-1) ergs/s,\nrespectively, where i is the disk inclination. A small temperature gradient of\np = 0.535-0.005+0.004, together with the high disk temperature, is regarded as\nthe signatures of the slim accretion disk model, suggesting that M33 X-8 was\naccreting at high mass accretion rate. With a correction factor for the slim\ndisk taken into account, the innermost disk radius, R_in =81.9-6.5+5.9 (cos\ni)^(-0.5) km, corresponds to the black hole mass of M \\sim 10 M_sun (cos\ni)^(-0.5). Accordingly, the bolometric disk luminosity is estimated to be about\n80 (cos i)^(-0.5)% of the Eddington limit. A numerically calculated slim disk\nspectrum was found to reach a similar result. Thus, the extremely\nsuper-Eddington luminosity is not required to explain the nature of M33 X-8.\nThis conclusion is utilized to argue for the existence of intermediate mass\nblack holes with M > 100 M_sun radiating at the sub/trans-Eddington luminosity,\namong ultraluminous X-ray sources with L_disk > 10^(40) ergs/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 05:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Adopting these methods, we have carried out the first study of\nfinite-density QCD with Wilson-type quarks and the first calculation of the\nequation of state with 2+1 flavors of Wilson-type quarks. We present results of\nthese studies and discuss perspectives towards a clarification of the\nproperties of 2+1 flavor QCD at the physical point, at finite temperatures and\ndensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 07:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-25"}

With enhanced mixing, our synthetic LCs start their post-breakout\nre-brightening phase earlier, follow a more gradual rise to peak, appear\nredder, and fade faster after peak due to enhanced gamma-ray escape.\nNon-thermal electrons, crucial for the production of HeI lines, deposit a\ndominant fraction of their energy as heat. Because energy deposition is\ngenerally local well after the LC peak, the broad HeI lines characteristic of\nmaximum-light SN IIb/Ib spectra require mixing that places 56Ni and helium\nnuclei to within a gamma-ray mean-free-path.

In contrast, the lack of HeI lines in SNe Ic may result from a variety\nof causes: A genuine helium deficiency; strongly-asymmetric mixing; weak\nmixing; or a more massive, perhaps single, progenitor characterized by a larger\noxygen-rich core.

The solutions in the second class\nhave exact analytic expressions which have never been found in the literature.\nThe acceleration equation of the universe in general relativity is only a\nspecial case of them.

We study\nsimilarity in image registration in the context of Locally Orderless Images\n(LOI), which is the natural way to study density estimates and reveals the 3\nfundamental scales: the measurement scale, the intensity scale, and the\nintegration scale.\n  This paper has three main contributions: Firstly, we rephrase a large set of\npopular similarity measures into a common framework, which we refer to as\nLocally Orderless Registration, and which makes full use of the features of\nlocal histograms. Secondly, we extend the theoretical understanding of the\nlocal histograms. Thirdly, we use our framework to compare two state-of-the-art\nintensity density estimators for image registration: The Parzen Window (PW) and\nthe Generalized Partial Volume (GPV), and we demonstrate their differences on a\npopular similarity measure, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).\n  We conclude, that complicated similarity measures such as NMI may be\nevaluated almost as fast as simple measures such as Sum of Squared Distances\n(SSD) regardless of the choice of PW and GPV. Also, GPV is an asymmetric\nmeasure, and PW is our preferred choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 12:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Three design criteria are\nconsidered to optimize the relay filter. The first criterion is the\nminimization of the relay transmit power subject to per-subcarrier\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints, the second is the maximization of the\nworst subcarrier channel SNR subject to source and relay transmit power\nconstraints, and the third is the maximization of data rate subject to source\nand relay transmit power constraints. It is shown that the first problem\nreduces to a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem by semi-definite\nrelaxation and the solution to the relaxed SDP problem has rank one under a\nmild condition. For the latter two problems, the problem of joint source power\nallocation and relay filter design is considered and an efficient algorithm is\nproposed for each problem based on alternating optimization and the projected\ngradient method (PGM). Numerical results show that the proposed FF relay\nsignificantly outperforms simple AF relays with insignificant increase in\ncomplexity. Thus, the proposed FF relay provides a practical alternative to the\nAF relaying scheme for OFDM transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 13:45:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 15:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Results: NGC7538IRS1 remains a single compact and massive\ngas core with extraordinarily high column densities, corresponding to visual\nextinctions on the order of 10^5mag, and average densities within the central\n2000AU of ~2.1x10^9cm^-3 that have not been measured before.

Taking the\n2pns(^1P^o) resonance series embedded in the 2sEp(^1P^o) continuum in beryllium\natom as an example, the time evolution of the autoionizing wave packet in\nenergy domain and in coordinate space is calculated and analyzed, where Fano\nprofiles build up in the photoelectron energy during the process. A proposed\npump-probe scheme assumes that the probe beam ionizes the 2s inner electron in\nthe wave packet. The lifetimes of the resonances and the photoelectron energy\ndistribution can be obtained from the ionization yield versus the time delay of\nthe probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 15:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-25"}

At high spins in 28Si+28Si (oblate-oblate system), a\nstable dinuclear configuration is found to be equator-equator touching one. The\nnormal modes around the equilibrium are investigated. These modes are expected\nto be the origin of a large number of resonances observed. Furthermore, due to\nthe axially asymmetric shape of the stable configuration of 28Si+28Si, the\nsystem rotates preferentially around the axis with the largest moment of\ninertia, which gives rise to wobbling motion ($K$-mixing). Energy spectra for\nthe normal modes and for the extended model including the wobbling motion are\ngiven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 15:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}
