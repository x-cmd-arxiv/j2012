We find a\nbrightness temperature of 1630 K for the radio photosphere. Since the emission\nis optically thick, we can directly estimate IRC+10216's average luminosity,\nwhich is 8600 L(Sun). This value is in excellent agreement with what is\npredicted from the period-luminosity relation for carbon-rich Miras. Assuming\nan effective temperature of 2750 K for IRC+10216, it implies an optical\nphotospheric diameter of 3.8 AU.

Bandwidth\nselection, particularly in a data-adaptive way, is a serious issue and not well\nstudied for detection problems. To ensure data adaptation, we select the\nbandwidth by cross-validation, but in a sequential way leading to a functional\nestimation approach. This article provides the asymptotic theory for the method\nunder fairly weak assumptions on the dependence structure of the error terms,\nwhich cover, e.g., GARCH($p,q$) processes, by establishing (sequential)\nfunctional central limit theorems for the cross-validation objective function\nand the associated bandwidth selector.

Multifrequency\nVLBA observations were carried out over twelve epochs in 2006 at four\nfrequencies between 8 and 15 GHz. We detect parsec-scale Faraday RMs in 149\nsources and find the quasars to have larger RMs on average than BL Lac objects.\nThe median core RMs are significantly higher than in the jet components. This\nis especially true for quasars where we detect a significant negative\ncorrelation between the magnitude of the RM and the de-projected distance from\nthe core. We perform detailed simulations of the observational errors of total\nintensity, polarization and Faraday rotation, and concentrate on the errors of\ntransverse Faraday RM gradients in unresolved jets. Our simulations show that\nthe finite image restoring beam size has a significant effect on the observed\nRM gradients, and spurious gradients can occur due to noise in the data if the\njet is less than two beams wide in polarization. We detect significant\ntransverse RM gradients in four sources (0923+392, 1226+023, 2230+114 and\n2251+158). In 1226+023 the RM is for the first time seen to change sign from\npositive to negative over the transverse cuts, which supports the presence of a\nhelical magnetic field in the jet. In this source we also detect variations in\nthe jet RM over a time scale of three months, which are difficult to explain\nwith external Faraday screens and suggest internal Faraday rotation. By\ncomparing fractional polarization changes in jet components between the four\nfrequency bands to depolarization models we find that an external purely random\nFaraday screen viewed through only a few lines of sight can explain most of our\npolarization observations but in some sources, such as 1226+023 and 2251+158,\ninternal Faraday rotation is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 16:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 2013 19:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

An important issue is to understand\nvarious differences in the physical properties of the spacetime across the\nbounce. We investigate this issue in the context of various geometrical\nstructures, identified by Kasner exponents of the metric, which arise on\napproach to the singularity in the classical theory. Using effective spacetime\ndescription of Bianchi-I model in loop quantum cosmology with dust, radiation\nand stiff matter, we find that as in the classical theory, geometrical\nstructures such as a cigar or a pancake form, but they are finite and\nnon-singular. Depending on the initial conditions of matter and anisotropies,\ndifferent geometric structures are possible in the pre- and post-bounce phases\nin physical evolution. Thus, quantum gravitational effects can cause a Kasner\ntransition in Bianchi-I spacetime, which is not possible at the classical\nlevel. Interestingly, we find that not all transitions are allowed at the level\nof effective dynamics in loop quantum cosmology.

In the stacked caustic diagram, the X-ray AGN appear to\npreferentially lie along the caustics, suggestive of an infalling population.\nThey also appear to avoid the region with lowest cluster-centric radii and\nrelative velocities (r_proj<0.4 r_500; |v-<v>|/sigma_v<0.8), which is dominated\nby the virialized population of galaxies accreted earliest into the clusters.\nMoreover the velocity dispersion of the 48 X-ray AGN is 1.51x that of the\noverall cluster population, which is consistent with the sqrt(2) ratio expected\nby simple energetic arguments when comparing infalling versus virialized\npopulations. This kinematic segregation is significant at the 4.66-sigma level.\nWhen splitting the X-ray AGN sample into two according to X-ray or infrared\n(IR) luminosity, both X-ray bright and IR-bright sub-samples show higher\nvelocity dispersions than their X-ray dim and IR-dim counterparts at >2sigma\nsignificance.

Hypotheses for mound formation include evaporitic,\nlacustrine, fluviodeltaic, and aeolian processes, but the origin and original\nextent of Gale's mound is unknown. Here we show new measurements of sedimentary\nstrata within the mound that indicate ~3 degree outward dips oriented radially\naway from the mound center, inconsistent with the first three hypotheses.\nMoreover, although mounds are widely considered to be erosional remnants of a\nonce crater-filling unit, we find that the Gale mound's current form is close\nto its maximal extent. Instead we propose that the mound's structure,\nstratigraphy, and current shape can be explained by growth in place near the\ncenter of the crater mediated by wind-topography feedbacks. Our model shows how\nsediment can initially accrete near the crater center far from crater-wall\nkatabatic winds, until the increasing relief of the resulting mound generates\nmound-flank slope-winds strong enough to erode the mound. Our results indicate\nmound formation by airfall-dominated deposition with a limited role for\nlacustrine and fluvial activity, and potentially limited organic carbon\npreservation.

A multi-vortices model is developed to\nmodel both the leading edge and trailing edge vortices (TEVs), which offers\nimproved accuracy compared with using only single vortex at each separation\nlocation. The lift is obtained by integrating the unsteady Blasius equation. It\nis found that the motion of vortices contributes significantly to the overall\naerodynamic force on the flat plate. The shedding of TEVs and the stabilization\nof LEVs explicitly contributes to lift enhancement. A Kutta-like condition is\nused to determine the vortex intensity and location at the leading edge for\nlarge angle of attack cases; however, it is proposed to relax this condition\nfor small angle of attack cases and apply a 2D shear layer model to calculate\nthe circulation of the new added vortex. The results of the simulation are then\ncompared with classical numerical, modeled and experimental data for canonical\nunsteady flat plat problems. Good agreement with these data is observed.\nMoreover, these results suggested that the leading edge vortex shedding for\nsmall angles of attack should be modeled differently than that for large angles\nof attack. Finally, the results of vortex motion vs. lift indicate that both a\nmotion against the streamwise direction of the LEV and a streamwise motion of\nthe TEV contributes positive lift. This also provides the insights for future\nactive flow control of MAVs that the formation and shedding process of LEVs and\nTEVs can be manipulated to provide lift enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 22:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 01:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-21"}

In theory, the best approach to density\nincrease is via distributed multiuser MIMO, where several access points are\nconnected to a central server and operate as a large distributed multi-antenna\naccess point, ensuring that all transmitted signal power serves the purpose of\ndata transmission, rather than creating \"interference.\" In practice, while\nenterprise networks offer a natural setup in which distributed MIMO might be\npossible, there are serious implementation difficulties, the primary one being\nthe need to eliminate phase and timing offsets between the jointly coordinated\naccess points.\n  In this paper we propose AirSync, a novel scheme which provides not only time\nbut also phase synchronization, thus enabling distributed MIMO with full\nspatial multiplexing gains.

The data provide 5-7 year time\nbaselines with respect to pre-existing deep first-epoch observations. We\nmeasure the positions of thousands of M31 stars and hundreds of compact\nbackground galaxies in each field. High accuracy and robustness is achieved by\nbuilding and fitting a unique template for each individual object. The average\nproper motion for each field is obtained from the average motion of the M31\nstars between the epochs with respect to the background galaxies. For the three\nfields, the observed proper motions (mu_W,mu_N) are (-0.0458, -0.0376),\n(-0.0533, -0.0104), and (-0.0179,-0.0357) mas/yr, respectively. The ability to\naverage over large numbers of objects and over the three fields yields a final\naccuracy of 0.012 mas/yr. The robustness of the proper-motion measurements and\nuncertainties are supported by the fact that data from different instruments,\ntaken at different times and with different telescope orientations, as well as\nmeasurements of different fields, all yield statistically consistent results.\nPapers II and III explore the implications for our understanding of the\nhistory, future, and mass of the Local Group.

For\nexample, one may wish to select a subset of high-quality sequences that\nrepresent the diversity of a larger collection of sequences. One may also wish\nto specialize a large database of characterized \"reference sequences\" to a\nsmaller subset that is as close as possible on average to a collection of\n\"query sequences\" of interest.

Using this exact program we note that the performance of PAM appears\nto be good for simulated trees, and is faster than the exact algorithm for\nsmall trees. On the other hand, the exact program gives solutions for all\nnumbers of leaves less than or equal to the given desired number of leaves,\nwhile PAM only gives a solution for the pre-specified number of leaves. Via\napplication to real data, we show that the ADCL criterion chooses chimeric\nsequences less often than random subsets, while the maximization of\nphylogenetic diversity chooses them more often than random.

Since the\nstudy is mainly on the hadronization of partons at late time, the fluid picture\nis not used to trace the evolution of the system. The inclusive distributions\nat low $p_T$ are determined as the recombination products of thermal partons.\nThe $p_T$ dependencies of both pion and proton have a common exponential factor\napart from other dissimilar kinematic and resonance factors, because they are\ninherited from the same pool of thermal partons. Instead of the usual\ndescription based on hydrodynamics, the azimuthal anisotropy of the produced\nhadrons is explained as the consequence of the effects of minijets, either\nindirectly through the recombination of enhanced thermal partons in the\nvicinity of the trajectories of the semihard partons, or directly through\nthermal-shower recombination. Although our investigation is focussed on the\nsingle-particle distribution at midrapidity, we give reasons why a component in\nthat distribution can be identified with the ridge, which together with the\nsecond harmonic $v_2$ is due to the semihard partons created near the medium\nsurface that lead to calculable anisotropy in $\\phi$. It is shown that the\nhigher azimuthal harmonics, $v_n$, can also be well reproduced without\nreference to flow. The $p_T$ and centrality dependencies of the higher\nharmonics are prescribed by the interplay between TT and TS recombination\ncomponents.

So\nfar, there exist many SDLC models, one of which is the Waterfall model which\ncomprises five phases to be completed sequentially in order to develop a\nsoftware solution. However, SDLC of software systems has always encountered\nproblems and limitations that resulted in significant budget overruns, late or\nsuspended deliveries, and dissatisfied clients. The major reason for these\ndeficiencies is that project directors are not wisely assigning the required\nnumber of workers and resources on the various activities of the SDLC.\nConsequently, some SDLC phases with insufficient resources may be delayed;\nwhile, others with excess resources may be idled, leading to a bottleneck\nbetween the arrival and delivery of projects and to a failure in delivering an\noperational product on time and within budget.

We design a coordination scheme which\ncombines the use of ternary controllers with a self-triggered communication\npolicy. The communication policy requires the agents to collect, at each\nsampling time, relative measurements of their neighbors' states: the collected\ninformation is then used to update the control and determine the following\nsampling time. We prove that the proposed scheme ensures finite-time\nconvergence to a neighborhood of a consensus state. We then study the\nrobustness of the proposed self-triggered coordination system with respect to\nskews in the agents' local clocks, to delays, and to limited precision in\ncommunication. Furthermore, we present two significant variations of our\nscheme. First, we design a time-varying controller which asymptotically drives\nthe system to consensus. Second, we adapt our framework to a communication\nmodel in which an agent does not poll all its neighbors simultaneously, but\nsingle neighbors instead. This communication policy actually leads to a\nself-triggered \"gossip\" coordination system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 08:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-01"}

Based on this model, the thin disk can\nextend down to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) at accretion rates\nhigher than $0.02\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$; while the corona is weak since part of the\ncoronal gas is cooled by strong inverse Compton scattering of the disk photons.\nThis implies that the corona cannot produce as strong X-ray radiation as\nobserved in HLAGNs with large Eddington ratio. In addition to the viscous\nheating, other heating to the corona is necessary to interpret HLAGN. In this\npaper, we assume that a part of accretion energy released in the disk is\ntransported into the corona, heating up the electrons and thereby radiated\naway. We for the first time, compute the corona structure with additional\nheating, taking fully into account the mass supply to the corona and find that\nthe corona could indeed survive at higher accretion rates and its radiation\npower increases. The spectra composed of bremsstrahlung and Compton radiation\nare also calculated. Our calculations show that the Compton dominated spectrum\nbecomes harder with the increase of energy fraction ($f$) liberating in the\ncorona, and the photon index for hard X-ray($2-10 \\rm keV$) is $2.2 < \\Gamma <\n2.7 $. We discuss possible heating mechanisms for the corona. Combining the\nenergy fraction transported to the corona with the accretion rate by magnetic\nheating, we find that the hard X-ray spectrum becomes steeper at larger\naccretion rate and the bolometric correction factor ($L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm\n2-10keV}$) increases with increasing accretion rate for $f<8/35$, which is\nroughly consistent with the observational results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 11:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this framework we consider the effects of a\nfinite density of incoherent holon pairs in the normal state. Below a crossover\ntemperature, identified as the experimental \"upper pseudogap\", the scattering\nof the \"quanta\" of the phase of the holon-pair field against holons reproduces\nthe phenomenology of Fermi arcs coexisting with gap in the antinodal region. We\nthus obtain a microscopic derivation of the main features of the hole spectra\ndue to pseudogap. This result is obtained through a holon Green function which\nfollows naturally from the formalism and analytically interpolates between a\nFermi liquid-like and a d-wave superconductor behavior as the coherence length\nof the holon pair order parameter increases. By inserting the gauge coupling\nwith the spinon we construct explicitly the hole Green function and calculate\nits spectral weight and the corresponding density of states. So we prove that\nthe formation of holon pairs induces a depletion of states on the hole Fermi\nsurface. We compare our results with ARPES and tunneling experimental data. In\nour approach the hole preserves a finite Fermi surface until the\nsuperconducting transition, where it reduces to four nodes. Therefore we\npropose that the gap seen in the normal phase of cuprates is due to the thermal\nbroadening of the SC-like peaks masking the Fermi-liquid peak.

For\nfixed $\\eta$, we find that only the part of the spectrum corresponding to\neigenvalues $\\lambda \\lesssim \\eta^{-1}$ approaches Dirichlet boundary\nconditions, while the remainder of the spectrum is made of uncontrolled,\nspurious wall modes.
