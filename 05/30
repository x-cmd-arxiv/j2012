For relatively low values of the\nincident far ultraviolet flux on the cloud ({\\chi}<~ 1000; {\\chi}= 1= local\ninterstellar value), the columns of OH+ and H2O+ scale roughly as the cosmic\nray primary ionization rate {\\zeta}(crp) divided by the hydrogen nucleus\ndensity n. The H3O+ column is dominated by the second peak, and we show that if\nPAHs are present, N(H3O+) ~ 4x10^{13} cm^{-2} independent of {\\zeta}(crp) or n.\nIf there are no PAHs or very small grains at the second peak, N(H3O+) can\nattain such columns only if low ionization potential metals are heavily\ndepleted. We also model diffuse and translucent clouds in the interstellar\nmedium, and show how observations of N(OH+)/N(H) and N(OH+)/N(H2O+) can be used\nto estimate {\\zeta}(crp)/n, {\\chi}/n and A_V in them. We compare our models to\nHerschel observations of these two ions, and estimate {\\zeta}(crp) ~ 4-6 x\n10^-16 (n/100 cm^-3) s^-1 and \\chi/n = 0.03 cm^3 for diffuse foreground clouds\ntowards W49N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 18:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Our model is based on the evolution of dark matter\nhaloes within a cosmological N-body simulation, combined with prescriptions for\nthe formation of BH along with both Pop III and Pop II stars. We calculate the\nspatially-varying intensity of Lyman Werner (LW) radiation from stars and\nidentify the massive pristine haloes in which it is high enough to shut down\nmolecular hydrogen cooling. In contrast to previous BH seeding models with a\nspatially constant LW background, we find that the intensity of LW radiation\ndue to local sources, J_local, can be up to 10^6 times the spatially averaged\nbackground in the simulated volume and exceeds the critical value, J_crit, for\nthe complete suppression of molecular cooling, in some cases by 4 orders of\nmagnitude.

The onset of Pop II star formation at z~16\nsimultaneously marks the onset of the epoch of DCBH formation, as the increased\nlevel of LW radiation from Pop II stars is able to elevate the local levels of\nthe LW intensity to J_local > J_crit while Pop III stars fail to do so at any\ntime.

Using\nMonte-Carlo realizations of the merger and growth history of BHs, we show that\nX-rays from the earliest accreting BHs can provide such a feedback mechanism.\nOur calculations paint a self-consistent picture of black-hole-made climate\nchange, in which the first miniquasars---among them the ancestors of the z>6\nquasar SMBHs---globally warm the IGM and suppress the formation and growth of\nsubsequent generations of BHs. We present two specific models with global\nminiquasar feedback that provide excellent agreement with recent estimates of\nthe z=6 SMBH mass function. For each of these models, we estimate the rate of\nBH mergers at z>6 that could be detected by the proposed gravitational-wave\nobservatory eLISA/NGO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 19:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 14:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper, we develop a\nformalism to calculate the transport magnetic flux in a thin accretion disc,\nthus determining its evolution on a viscous/resistive timescale. The governing\nequations are derived by performing an asymptotic expansion in the limit of a\nthin disc, in the regime where the magnetic field is dominated by its vertical\ncomponent. Turbulent viscosity and resistivity are included, with an arbitrary\nvertical profile that can be adjusted to mimic the vertical structure of the\nturbulence. At a given radius and time, the rates of transport of mass and\nmagnetic flux are determined by a one-dimensional problem in the vertical\ndirection, in which the radial gradients of various quantities appear as source\nterms. We solve this problem to obtain the transport rates and the vertical\nstructure of the disc. The present paper is then restricted to the idealised\ncase of uniform diffusion coefficients, while a companion paper will study more\nrealistic vertical profiles of these coefficients. We show the advection of\nweak magnetic fields to be significantly faster than the advection of mass,\ncontrary to what a crude vertical averaging might suggest. This results from\nthe larger radial velocities away from the mid-plane, which barely affect the\nmass accretion owing to the low density in these regions but do affect the\nadvection of magnetic flux. Possible consequences of this larger accretion\nvelocity include a potentially interesting time-dependence with the magnetic\nflux distribution evolving faster than the mass distribution. If the disc is\nnot too thin, this fast advection may also partially solve the long-standing\nproblem of too efficient diffusion of an inclined magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 19:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The rigid potential is then replaced with\nstar particles which evolve self-consistently with the dark matter particles\nuntil z = 0.0. Regardless of the initial orientation of the disk, the inner\nparts of the haloes contract and change from prolate to oblate as the disk\ngrows to its full size.

An important aspect of the disc secular\nevolution driven by these perturbers is the radial migration of stars. It has\nbeen suggested recently that migration can populate a thick-disc component from\ninner-disc stars with high vertical energies. Since this has never been\ndemonstrated in simulations, we study in detail the effect of radial migration\non the disc velocity dispersion and disc thickness, by separating simulated\nstars into migrators and non-migrators. We apply this method to three isolated\nbarred Tree-SPH N-body galaxies with strong radial migration. Contrary to\nexpectations, we find that as stellar samples migrate, on the average, their\nvelocity dispersion change (by as much as 50%) in such a way as to\napproximately match the non-migrating population at the radius at which they\narrive. We show that, in fact, migrators suppress heating in parts of the disc.\nTo confirm the validity of our findings, we also apply our technique to three\ncosmological re-simulations, which use a completely different simulation scheme\nand, remarkably, find very similar results. We believe the inability of\nmigration to thicken discs is a fundamental property of internal disc\nevolution, irrespective of the migration mechanism at work. We explain this\nwith the approximate conservation of the (average) vertical and radial actions\nrather than the energy. This \"action mixing\" can be used to constrain the\nmigration rate in the Milky Way: estimates of the average vertical action in\nobservations for different populations of stars should reveal flattening with\nradius for older groups of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 12:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A\nproper consideration of the interaction between rotation and magnetic fields is\ntherefore essential. Previous studies have focused on a magnetic model where\nthe magnetic field strength is derived as a function of the stellar structure\nand angular momentum distribution. We have adapted our one-dimensional stellar\nrotation code, RoSE, to model the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field\nstrengths with a pair of time-dependent advection-diffusion equations coupled\nto the equations for the evolution of the angular momentum distribution and\nstellar structure. This produces a much more complete, though still reasonably\nsimple, model for the magnetic field evolution. Our model reproduces well\nobserved surface nitrogen enrichment of massive stars in the Large Magellanic\nCloud. In particular it reproduces a population of slowly-rotating\nnitrogen-enriched stars that cannot be explained by rotational mixing alone\nalongside the traditional rotationlly-enriched stars. The model further\npredicts a strong mass-dependency for the dynamo-driven field. Above a\nthreshold mass, the strength of the magnetic dynamo decreases abruptly and so\nwe predict that more massive stars are much less likely to support a\ndynamo-driven field than less massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

I study the magnetic interactions of these\nbinaries using the framework of a unipolar inductor model. The e.m.f. generated\nacross the non-magnetic NS as it moves through the magnetosphere sets up a\ncircuit connecting the two stars. The exact features of this circuit depend on\nthe uncertain resistance in the space between the stars R_space. Nevertheless,\nI show that there are interesting observational and/or dynamical effects\nirrespective of its exact value. When R_space is large, electric dissipation as\ngreat as ~10^{46} erg/s (for magnetar-strength fields) occurs in the\nmagnetosphere, which would exhibit itself as a hard X-ray precursor in the\nseconds leading up to merger. With less certainty, there may also be an\nassociated radio transient, but this would be observed well past merger (~hrs)\nbecause of interstellar dispersion. When R_space is small, electric dissipation\nlargely occurs in the surface layers of the magnetic NS. This can reach\n~10^{49} erg/s during the final ~1 sec before merger, similar to the energetics\nand timescales of short gamma-ray bursts. In addition, for dipole fields\ngreater than ~10^{12} G and a small R_space, magnetic torques spin up the\nmagnetized NS. This drains angular momentum from the binary and accelerates the\ninspiral. A faster coalescence results in less orbits occurring before merger,\nwhich would impact matched-filtering gravitational-wave searches by\nground-based laser interferometers and could create difficulties for studying\nalternative theories of gravity with compact inspirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 20:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Previous theoretical studies of these objects have concluded that\nthe atmospheres of planets b, c, and d are unusually cloudy or have unusual\ncloud properties. Some studies have also found that the inferred radii of some\nor all of the planets disagree with expectations of standard giant planet\nevolution models. Here we compare the available data to the predictions of our\nown set of atmospheric and evolution models that have been extensively tested\nagainst observations of field L and T dwarfs, including the reddest L dwarfs.\nUnlike some previous studies we require mutually consistent choices for\neffective temperature, gravity, cloud properties, and planetary radius. This\nprocedure thus yields plausible values for the masses, effective temperatures,\nand cloud properties of all three planets. We find that the cloud properties of\nthe HR 8799 planets are not unusual but rather follow previously recognized\ntrends, including a gravity dependence on the temperature of the L to T\nspectral transition--some reasons for which we discuss.

Solutions for planets c and d are consistent\nwith the generally accepted constraints on the age of the primary star and\norbital dynamics.

The size\nof these line lists is such that constructing a single model may require the\nconsideration of several billion lines. We present a procedure to simplify this\nprocess based on the use of cross sections. Line lists for water, H$_3^+$, HCN\n/HNC and ammonia have been turned into cross sections on a fine enough grid to\npreserve their spectroscopic features. Cross sections are provided at a fixed\nrange of temperatures and an interpolation procedure which can be used to\ngenerate cross sections at arbitrary temperatures is described. A web-based\ninterface (www.exomol.com/xsec) has been developed to allow astronomers to\ndownload cross sections at specified temperatures and spectral resolution.\nSpecific examples are presented for the key water molecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 22:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-27"}

A MOF usually consists of a hexagonal arrangement\nof air holes running down the length of a silica fiber surrounding a central\ncore of solid silica or, in some cases air. MOFs can exhibit a number of unique\nproperties, including zero dispersion at visible wavelengths and low or high\neffective nonlinearity [3]-[17], By varying the size of the holes and their\nnumber and position, one can also design MOFs with carefully controlled\ndispersive and modal properties. In this paper, we analyze and modeling the\nbehavior of the photonic crystal fiber (PCF) by using in the first step a\npropagator method based on the BPM method. With our BPM software, the electric\nfield contour of the fundamental mode of PCF was demonstrated. We also used it\nto see the variation of the effective index; an effective index model confirms\nthat such a fiber can be single mode for any wavelength. It would make a study\nof photonic crystal fibers, and a study of the numerical simulation methods\nallow the simulation of optical properties and has modeled the propagation of\nlight in this fiber type. After that we use the V-parameter because it offers a\nsimple way to design a photonic crystal fiber (PCF), by basing in a recent\nformulation of this parameter of a PCF, we provide numerically based empirical\nexpression for this quantity only dependent on the two structural parameters,\nthe air hole diameter and the hole-to-hole center spacing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 22:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-31"}

Furthermore, we selected another eight large and inactive\nactive regions (ARs), which are called fallow ARs (FARs), to compare them with\nthe SARs. We found that most of the SARs have a net magnetic flux higher than\n7.0\\times10^21 Mx, a total photospheric free magnetic energy higher than\n1.0\\times10^24 erg/cm, a magnetic neutral line with a steep horizontal magnetic\ngradient (\\geq 300 G/Mm) longer than 30 Mm, and an area with strong magnetic\nshear (shear angle \\geq 80\\degree) greater than 100 Mm^2. In contrast, the\nvalues of these parameters for the FARs are mostly very low. The Pearson\n\\c{hi}2 test was used to examine the significance of the difference between the\nSARs and FARs, and the results indicate that these two types of ARs can be\nfairly distinguished by each of these parameters. The significance levels are\n99.55%, 99.98%, 99.98%, and 99.96%, respectively. However, no single parameter\ncan distinguish them perfectly. Therefore we propose a composite index based on\nthese parameters, and find that the distinction between the two types of ARs is\nalso significant with a significance level of 99.96%. These results are useful\nfor a better physical understanding of the SAR and FAR\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 03:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

For simplicity, we consider a gas-pressure-dominated disk and assume\na constant opacity. We argue that the local turbulent dissipation rate due to\nthe disruption of MRI channel flows by secondary parasitic instabilities should\nbe uniform across most of the disk, almost up to the disk photosphere. We then\nobtain a self-consistent analytical solution for the vertical thermal structure\nof the disk, governed by the balance between the heating by MRI turbulence and\nthe cooling by radiative diffusion. Next, we argue that the coronal power\nfraction is determined by the competition between the Parker instability,\nviewed as a parasitic instability feeding off of MRI channel flows, and other\nparasitic instabilities. We show that the Parker instability inevitably becomes\nimportant near the disk surface, leading to a certain lower limit on the\ncoronal power. While most of the analysis in this paper focuses on the case of\na disk threaded by an externally imposed vertical magnetic field, we also\ndiscuss the zero-net-flux case, in which the magnetic field is produced by the\nMRI dynamo itself, and show that most of our arguments and conclusions should\nbe valid in this case as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 03:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Double-peaked emission profiles originating from the rotating\ncircumstellar disk were detected in all the lines. The disk parameters were\nestimated from model calculation in which the radial distribution of\ntemperature or surface density inside the disk has a power-law form. The\nsurface density should be sufficiently high so that the disk is optically thick\nfor all the CO lines, as discussed in previous studies based on interferometric\nobservations. The temperature and outer radius of the disk were also confirmed\nto be consistent with the previous results. Taking advantage of difference in\nposition of the photosphere among the CO lines, we revealed temperature\ndistribution in vertical direction. The temperature of 12CO (J=3-2) emitting\nregion is about twice higher than that of any other CO emitting region; the\nformer is about 59 K while the latter is about 31 K at 100 AU from the central\nstar, suggesting that there are at least two distinct temperature regions.

Purpose: We have improved\nthe sensitivity to T-odd, P-even interactions in nuclear beta decay. Methods:\nWe measured proton-electron coincidences from decays of longitudinally\npolarized neutrons with a highly symmetric detector array designed to cancel\nthe time-reversal-even, parity-odd Standard-Model contributions to polarized\nneutron decay.

We obtain that the\n\\sigma resonance is a compact object with $\\la\nr^2\\ra_s^\\sigma=(0.19\\pm0.02)-i(0.06\\pm0.02)$ fm^2. Within our approach,\nemploying unitary chiral perturbation theory, the \\sigma is a dynamically\ngenerated resonance that stems from the pion-pion interactions. Given its small\nsize we conclude that the two pions inside the resonance are merged. A\nfour-quark picture is then more appropriate. However, when the pion mass\nincreases, for pion masses somewhat above 400 MeV, the picture of a two-pion\nmolecule is the appropriate one. The \\sigma is then a spread \\pi\\pi bound\nstate. These results are connected with other recent works that support a non\nstandard nature of the \\sigma as well, while fulfilling strong QCD constraints,\nas well as with lattice QCD. We offer a detailed study of the low-energy S-wave\n\\pi\\pi scattering data from where we extract our values for the threshold\nparameters of S-wave \\pi\\pi phase shifts, the {\\cal O}(p^4) chiral perturbation\ntheory low energy constants as well as the \\sigma pole position.

Special emphasis is laid on time-delay experiments,\nwhere attosecond XUV pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at\nwell-defined times, followed by a probing process in real time by a\nphase-locked, infrared laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a\n\"clock\" to monitor the ionization event, but the observable delays do not\ncorrespond directly to the delay associated with single-photon ionization.\nInstead, a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement\ninduced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics. This\nartifact is traced back to a phase-shift of the above-threshold ionization\ntransition matrix element, which we call the continuum-continuum phase.

How\ndoes this approach converge with the size of the supercell is generally not\ntackled for the obvious reason of keeping the computational load to an\naffordable level. The present paper addresses the problem of substitutional\nnitrogen doping of graphene. DFT calculations have been performed for 9x9 and\n10x10 supercells. Although these calculations correspond to N concentrations\nthat differ by about 10%, the local densities of states on and around the\ndefects are found to depend significantly on the supercell size.

The tight-binding Hamiltonian is used to calculate\nthe STM image of graphene around an isolated N atom. STM images are also\ncalculated for graphene doped with 0.5 % concentration of nitrogen.

The observations\nshow the formation of a light bridge at one corner of the sunspot by a slow\nintrusion of neighbouring penumbral filaments. This divided the umbra into two\nindividual umbral cores. During the light bridge formation, there was a steep\nincrease in its intensity from 0.28 to 0.7 I_QS in nearly 4 hr, followed by a\ngradual increase to quiet Sun (QS) values in 13 hr. This increase in intensity\nwas accompanied by a large reduction in the field strength from 1800 G to 300\nG. The smaller umbral core gradually broke away from the parent sunspot nearly\n2 days after the formation of the light bridge rendering the parent spot\nwithout a penumbra at the location of fragmentation. The penumbra in the\nfragment disappeared first within 34 hr, followed by the fragment whose area\ndecayed exponentially with a time constant of 22 hr. The depleted penumbra in\nthe parent sunspot regenerated when the inclination of the magnetic field at\nthe penumbra-QS boundary became within 40 deg. from being completely horizontal\nand this occurred near the end of the fragment's lifetime. After the\ndisappearance of the fragment, another light bridge formed in the parent which\nhad similar properties as the fragmenting one, but did not divide the sunspot.\nThe significant weakening in field strength in the light bridge along with the\npresence of granulation is suggestive of strong convection in the sunspot which\nmight have triggered the expulsion and fragmentation of the smaller spot.\nAlthough the presence of QS photospheric conditions in sunspot umbrae could be\na necessary condition for fragmentation, it is not a sufficient one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 13:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 12:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper\nwe consider three different models for PageRank games on undirected graphs such\nas certain social networks. In undirected graphs players may delete links at\nwill, but typically cannot add links without the other player's permission.

Physics data taking has been\ncontinuing since April 2011. A ratio of observed-to-predicted event rate of\n0.944 +/- 0.016 (stat) +/- 0.040 (syst) was obtained in 101 days of detector\nrunning. Analyzing both the rate and their energy spectral shape, we found\nsin^{2}2\\theta_{13} = 0.086 +/- 0.041 (stat) +/- 0.030 (syst) at \\Delta\nm^2_{atm} = 2.4 x 10^{-3} eV^2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 14:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Nevertheless, simulations can sometimes be time-consuming. In this\ncase, an approximation of the code input/output relation is made using a\nmetamodel. Actually, a computer code can often be run at different levels of\ncomplexity and a hierarchy of levels of code can hence be obtained. For\nexample, it can be a finite element model with a more or less fine mesh. The\naim of our research is to study the use of several levels of a code to predict\nthe output of a costly computer code. The presented multi-stage metamodel is a\nparticular case of co-kriging which is a well-known geostatistical method. We\nfirst describe the construction of the co-kriging model and we focus then on a\nsequential experimental design strategy. Indeed, one of the strengths of\nco-kriging is that it provides through the predictive co-kriging variance an\nestimation of the model error at each point of the input space parameter.\nTherefore, to improve the surrogate model we can sequentially add points in the\ntraining set at locations where the predictive variances are the largest ones.\nNonetheless, in a multi-fidelity framework, we also have to choose which level\nof code we have to run. We present here different strategies to choose this\nlevel.

In such application scenarios, an item passes between two objects\nwhen the objects are sufficiently close (i.e., when they are, so-called, in\ncontact), and hence once an item is initiated, it can penetrate the object\npopulation through the evolving network of contacts among objects, termed\ncontact network.

However, existing work did not exploit the important property of\nskewed velocity distributions. In many real world scenarios, objects travel\npredominantly along only a few directions. Examples include vehicles on road\nnetworks, flights, people walking on the streets, etc. The search space for a\nquery is heavily dependent on the velocity distribution of the objects grouped\nin the nodes of an index tree. Motivated by this observation, we propose the\nvelocity partitioning (VP) technique, which exploits the skew in velocity\ndistribution to speed up query processing using moving object indexes. The VP\ntechnique first identifies the \"dominant velocity axes (DVAs)\" using a\ncombination of principal components analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering.\nThen, a moving object index (e.g., a TPR-tree) is created based on each DVA,\nusing the DVA as an axis of the underlying coordinate system. An object is\nmaintained in the index whose DVA is closest to the object's current moving\ndirection. Thus, all the objects in an index are moving in a near 1-dimensional\nspace instead of a 2-dimensional space. As a result, the expansion of the\nsearch space with time is greatly reduced, from a quadratic function of the\nmaximum speed (of the objects in the search range) to a near linear function of\nthe maximum speed. The VP technique can be applied to a wide range of moving\nobject index structures. We have implemented the VP technique on two\nrepresentative ones, the TPR*-tree and the Bx-tree. Extensive experiments\nvalidate that the VP technique consistently improves the performance of those\nindex structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 14:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-31"}

A very natural class of gates for fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation is the Clifford gate set and as such their usefulness for universal\nquantum computation is of great interest. Clifford group gates augmented by\nmagic state preparation give the possibility of simulating universal quantum\ncomputation. However, experimentally one cannot expect to perfectly prepare\nmagic states. Nonetheless, it has been shown that by repeatedly applying\noperations from the Clifford group and measurements in the Pauli basis, the\nfidelity of noisy prepared magic states can be increased arbitrarily close to a\npure magic state [1]. We investigate the robustness of magic state distillation\nto perturbations of the initial states to arbitrary locations in the Bloch\nsphere due to noise. Additionally, we consider a depolarizing noise model on\nthe quantum gates in the decoding section of the distillation protocol and\ndemonstrate its effect on the convergence rate and threshold value. Finally, we\nestablish that faulty magic state distillation is more efficient than\nfault-tolerance-assisted magic state distillation at low error rates due to the\nlarge overhead in the number of quantum gates and qubits required in a\nfault-tolerance architecture. The ability to perform magic state distillation\nwith noisy gates leads us to conclude that this could be a realistic scheme for\nfuture small-scale quantum computing devices as fault-tolerance need only be\nused in the final steps of the protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 15:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

The flow represents an optimal distribution\nof web surfers on the web graph in the sense of entropy maximization.\n  In this paper, we prove the convergence of Tomlin's HOTS algorithm. We first\nstudy a simplified version of the algorithm, which is a fixed point scaling\nalgorithm designed to solve the matrix balancing problem for nonnegative\nirreducible matrices. The proof of convergence is general (nonlinear\nPerron-Frobenius theory) and applies to a family of deformations of HOTS. Then,\nwe address the effective HOTS algorithm, designed by Tomlin for the ranking of\nweb pages. The model is a network entropy maximization problem generalizing\nmatrix balancing. We show that, under mild assumptions, the HOTS algorithm\nconverges with a linear convergence rate. The proof relies on a uniqueness\nproperty of the fixed point and on the existence of a Lyapunov function.\n  We also show that the coordinate descent algorithm can be used to find the\nideal and effective HOTS vectors and we compare HOTS and coordinate descent on\nfragments of the web graph. Our numerical experiments suggest that the\nconvergence rate of the HOTS algorithm may deteriorate when the size of the\ninput increases.

When the\ncorresponding multiphoton Rabi oscillations are underdamped, zero temperature\nquantum fluctuations determine comparable populations of all quasienergy states\nwhich belong to a resonant multiphoton doublet. Most interestingly, the quantum\nfluctuations probe the multiphoton transitions by inducing several peaks in the\nnoise spectrum of the resonator observables. In particular, the noise of the\nphoton number contains complete information about the multiphoton states and\ntheir stationary populations via pairs of nearly symmetric peaks at opposite\nfrequencies. Their widths are determined by the damping of the Rabi\noscillations and their heights are proportional to the stationary nonequilbrium\npopulations. A finite detuning from a multiphoton resonance generates a\nquasielastic noise peak at zero frequency. In addition, we relate the\nstationary populations of the quasienergy states with an effective quantum\ntemperature and discuss the role of a finite temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 10:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In simple cases, single polymorphic loci\nexplain a significant fraction of the phenotype variability. However, many\ntraits of interest appear to be subject to multifactorial control by groups of\ngenetic loci instead. Accurate detection of such multivariate associations is\nnontrivial and often hindered by limited power. At the same time, confounding\ninfluences such as population structure cause spurious association signals that\nresult in false positive findings if they are not accounted for in the model.\nHere, we propose LMM-Lasso, a mixed model that allows for both, multi-locus\nmapping and correction for confounding effects. Our approach is simple and free\nof tuning parameters, effectively controls for population structure and scales\nto genome-wide datasets. We show practical use in genome-wide association\nstudies and linkage mapping through retrospective analyses. In data from\nArabidopsis thaliana and mouse, our method is able to find a genetic cause for\nsignificantly greater fractions of phenotype variation in 91% of the phenotypes\nconsidered. At the same time, our model dissects this variability into\ncomponents that result from individual SNP effects and population structure. In\naddition to this increase of genetic heritability, enrichment of known\ncandidate genes suggests that the associations retrieved by LMM-Lasso are more\nlikely to be genuine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 05:43:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 12:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}
