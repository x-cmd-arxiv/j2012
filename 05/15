Using\nthe non-LTE wind code CMFGEN, we simultaneously analyzed the FUV-UV and optical\nspectral range to determine the photospheric properties and wind parameters. We\nderived effective temperatures, luminosities, surface gravities, surface\nabundances, mass-loss rates, wind terminal velocities, and clumping filling\nfactors. The supergiants define a very clear evolutionary sequence, in terms of\nages and masses, from younger and more massive stars to older stars with lower\ninitial masses. O4 supergiants cluster around the 3 Myr isochrone and are more\nmassive than 60 Msun, while the O5 to O7.5 stars have masses in the range 50 -\n40 Msun and are 4 +/- 0.3 Myr old. The surface chemical composition is typical\nof evolved O supergiants (nitrogen-rich, carbon- and oxygen-poor). While the\nobserved ranges of carbon and nitrogen mass-fractions are compatible with those\nexpected from evolutionary models for the measured stellar masses, the N/C\nratios as a function of age are inconsistent with the theoretical predictions\nfor the four earliest (O4 spectral type) stars of the sample. We question the\nefficiency of rotational mixing as a function of age for these stars and\nsuggest that another mechanism may be needed to explain the observed abundance\npatterns.

Owing to a recent interaction\nbetween the dwarf galaxy VCC1249 and the halo gas of the gE M49, neutral\nhydrogen has been displaced from the interstellar medium of this dwarf into the\nVirgo ICM. Observations also reveal multiple compact star-forming regions that\nare embedded in this HI cloud, with a projected separation up to 13 kpc from\nVCC1249 in the northwest direction.\n  Aims: Motivated by recent NUV imaging from GUViCS of the VCC1249/M49 system\nthat shows significant ongoing/recent star formation in the compact regions, we\naim to constrain the origin of these outlying HII regions with a\nmulti-wavelength approach.\n  Methods: Using deep optical (u, g, i, z) imaging from NGVS and new Halpha\nimaging obtained at the San Pedro Martir observatory together with Keck\nlong-slit spectroscopy, we characterize the SFR, ages, and metallicity of\nVCC1249 and its outlying compact regions.

The joint action of the two mechanisms led to the removal of the HI\ngas from the ISM of VCC1249, while the gravitational tides triggered the\nstellar tail and counter-tail of VCC1249. Our SED analysis reveals that the\nstar formation in this galaxy was truncated around 200 Myr ago and that the\noutlying HII regions were born in situ about 10 Myr ago out of pre-enriched gas\nremoved from the dwarf galaxy.

The repeater station is located within the fields\nof view common to the four reference bases, such as in a platform transported\nby a satellite, balloon, aircraft, etc. Signal transmitted by one of the\nreference bases is retransmitted by the transponder, received back by the four\nbases, producing four ranging measurements which are processed to determine\nuniquely the time delays undergone in every retransmission process.

We also\nprovide new classes of ideals of linear type. We propose the construction of a\ngraph, namely the generator graph of an ideal, where the monomial generators\nserve as vertices for the graph. We show that when $I$ is a square-free\nmonomial ideal generated in the same degree that is at least 2 and the\ngenerator graph of $I$ is the graph of a disjoint union of trees and graphs\nwith unique odd cycles then $I$ is an ideal of linear type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 18:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 16:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-21"}

Geometric\nmeasure of quantum discord is another measure of quantum correlations.\nRecently, the geometric quantum discord for multipartite states has been\nintroduced by Jianwei Xu [arxiv:quant/ph.1205.0330]. Motivated from the recent\nstudy [Ann.

The dynamics of QD and GQD is investigated under\namplitude damping, phase damping, depolarizing and flipping channels. It is\nseen that the quantum discord vanishes for p>0.75 in case of three-qubit GHZ\nstates and for p>0.5 for six qubit GHZ states. This implies that multipartite\nstates are more fragile to decoherence for higher values of N. Surprisingly, a\nrapid sudden death of discord occurs in case of phase flip channel. However,\nfor bit flip channel, no sudden death happens for the six-qubit states. On the\nother hand, depolarizing channel heavily influences the QD and GQD as compared\nto the amplitude damping channel. It means that the depolarizing channel has\nthe most destructive influence on the discords for multipartite states. From\nthe perspective of accelerated observers, it is seen that effect of environment\non QD and GQD is much stronger than that of the acceleration of non-inertial\nframes. The degradation of QD and GQD happens due to Unruh effect. Furthermore,\nQD exhibits more robustness than GQD when the multipartite systems are exposed\nto environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 18:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

An\ninterpretation of the difference between these GMRs (an actual and a modeled\none) as a random component leads to a general overestimation of residual\nvariance and hazard.

ISO217 is only one of a\nhandful of brown dwarfs and VLMS (M5-M8) for which an outflow has been detected\nand that show that the T Tauri phase continues at the substellar limit. We\nmeasure a spatial extension of the outflow of +/-190mas (+/-30AU) and\nvelocities of +/-40-50kms/s. We show that the velocity asymmetry between both\nlobes is variable on timescales of a few years and that the strong asymmetry of\na factor of 2 found in 2007 might be smaller than originally anticipated when\nusing a more realistic stellar rest-velocity. We also detect forbidden\n[FeII]7155 emission, for which we propose as potential origin the hot inner\nregions of the outflow. To understand the ISO217 system, we determine the disk\nproperties based on radiative transfer modeling of the SED. This disk model\nagrees very well with Herschel/PACS data at 70mu.

By contrasting measurements\nof sigma_R with predictions from linear perturbation theory, one can test for\neventual departures from the standard description of gravity on large\ncosmological scales.\n  The proposed estimator exploits the information contained in the 1-point\nmoments and 2-point correlators of the matter and galaxy density fields, and it\ncan be applied on cosmic scales where linear and semi-linear perturbative\napproximations of the evolution of matter overdensities offer a satisfactory\ndescription of the full underlying theory. We implement the test with N-body\nsimulations to quantify potential systematics and successfully show that we are\nable to recover the present day value of sigma_8 `hidden' in the simulation. We\nalso design a consistency check to gauge the soundness of the results inferred\nwhen the formalism is applied to real (as opposed to simulated) data. We expect\nthat this approach will provide a sensitive probe of the clustering of matter\nwhen applied to future large redshift survey such as BigBOSS and EUCLID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 21:21:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 13:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Surprisingly, many key theoretical\npredictions for this ultra-relativistic regime have yet to be tested in a\nlaboratory. Graphene, a 2D material in which electrons behave like massless\nDirac fermions, provides a unique opportunity to experimentally test such\npredictions. The response of Dirac fermions to a Coulomb potential in graphene\nis central to a wide range of electronic phenomena and can serve as a sensitive\nprobe of graphene's intrinsic dielectric constant, the primary factor\ndetermining the strength of electron-electron interactions in this material.\nHere we present a direct measurement of the nanoscale response of Dirac\nfermions to a single Coulomb potential placed on a gated graphene device.\nScanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy were used to fabricate tunable\ncharge impurities on graphene and to measure how they are screened by Dirac\nfermions for a Q = +1|e| impurity charge state. Electron-like and hole-like\nDirac fermions were observed to respond very differently to tunable Coulomb\npotentials.

One way to stop spreading over the airline network are\ntravel restrictions for major airports or network hubs based on the total\nnumber of passengers of an airport. Here, we test alternative strategies using\nedge removal, cancelling targeted flight connections rather than restricting\ntraffic for network hubs, for controlling spreading over the airline network.\nWe employ a SEIR metapopulation model that takes into account the population of\ncities, simulates infection within cities and across the network of the top 500\nairports, and tests different flight cancellation methods for limiting the\ncourse of infection. The time required to spread an infection globally, as\nsimulated by a stochastic global spreading model was used to rank the candidate\ncontrol strategies. The model includes both local spreading dynamics at the\nlevel of populations and long-range connectivity obtained from real global\nairline travel data. Simulated spreading in this network showed that spreading\ninfected 37% less individuals after cancelling a quarter of flight connections\nbetween cities, as selected by betweenness centrality. The alternative strategy\nof closing down whole airports causing the same number of cancelled connections\nonly reduced infections by 18%. In conclusion, selecting highly ranked single\nconnections between cities for cancellation was more effective, resulting in\nfewer individuals infected with influenza, compared to shutting down whole\nairports. It is also a more efficient strategy, affecting fewer passengers\nwhile producing the same reduction in infections.\n  The network of connections between the top 500 airports is available under\nthe resources link on our website http://www.biological-networks.org.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 03:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

Although several improvements to the algorithm have been\nproposed, none of these improvements avoid the following two sources of\napproximation: 1) lack of sufficient statistics: sampling is not from the true\nposterior density given data but from an approximate posterior density given\nsummary statistics; and 2) non-zero tolerance: sampling from the posterior\ndensity given summary statistics is achieved only in the limit of zero\ntolerance. The first source of approximation can be improved by adding a\nsummary statistic, but an increase in the number of summary statistics could\nintroduce additional variance caused by the low acceptance rate. Consequently,\nmany researchers have attempted to develop techniques to choose informative\nsummary statistics.

We observed a rapid disappearance of the PLFs\nafter a C1.7 class flare, which occurred close to the PIL. The local\ncorrelation tracking (LCT) of these features shows presence of horizontal flows\ndirected away from the end-points of the PLFs, similar to the radial outward\nflow found around regular sunspots, which is also known as the moat flow. Hard\nX-ray emission, coincident with the location of the PLFs, is found in RHESSI\nobservations, suggesting a spatial correlation between the occurrence of the\nflare and decay of the PLFs. Vector magnetic field derived from the\nobservations obtained by Hinode spectro-polarimeter SOT/SP instrument, before\nand after the flare, shows a significant change in the horizontal as well as\nthe vertical component of the field, after the flare. The weakening of both the\ncomponents of the magnetic field in the flare interval suggests that rapid\ncancellation and/or submergence of the magnetic field in PLFs occurred during\nthe flare interval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 04:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

We find that the\nlong-term torque exerted by the fallback disc can substantially influence the\nlate-time period distribution, but with quantitative differences which depend\non whether the initial spin distribution is dominated by slow or fast pulsars.\nFor the latter, a single-peaked initial spin distribution becomes bimodal at\nlater times. Timing ages tend to underestimate the real age of older pulsars,\nand overestimate the age of younger ones. Braking indices cluster in the range\n1.5 <~ n <~ 3 for slow-born pulsars, and -0.5 <~ n <~ 5 for fast-born pulsars,\nwith the younger objects found predominantly below n <~ 3.

In this model, when the CR detects the PU to be (i) busy it does not\ntransmit and; (ii) PU to be idle it transmits. Two situations based on CR's\ndetection of PU are considered, where the CR detects PU (i) perfectly -\nreferred to as the \"ideal case\" and; (ii) imperfectly - referred to as \"non\nideal case\". For both the cases we bring out the rate region, sum capacity of\nPU and CR and spectral efficiency factor - the ratio of sum capacity of PU and\nCR to the capacity of PU without CR. We consider the Rayleigh fading channel to\nprovide insight to our results. For the ideal case we study the effect of PU\noccupancy on spectral efficiency factor. For the non ideal case, in addition to\nthe effect of occupancy, we study the effect of false alarm and missed\ndetection on the rate region and spectral efficiency factor. We characterize\nthe set of values of false alarm and missed detection probabilities for which\nthe system benefits, in the form of admissible regions. We show that false\nalarm has a more profound effect on the spectral efficiency factor than missed\ndetection. We also show that when PU occupancy is small, the effects of both\nfalse alarm and missed detection decrease. Finally, for the standard detection\ntechniques viz. energy detection, matched filter and magnitude squared\ncoherence, we show that that the matched filter performs best followed by\nmagnitude squared coherence followed by energy detection with respect to\nspectral efficiency factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 06:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

In this paper, we study the\ncross-layer design and optimization for delay quality-of-service (QoS)\nprovisioning in two-way relay systems. Our goal is to find the optimal\ntransmission policy to maximize the weighted sum throughput of the two users in\nthe physical layer while guaranteeing the individual statistical delay-QoS\nrequirement for each user in the datalink layer. This statistical delay-QoS\nrequirement is characterized by the QoS exponent. By integrating the concept of\neffective capacity, the cross-layer optimization problem is equivalent to a\nweighted sum effective capacity maximization problem. We derive the jointly\noptimal power and rate adaptation policies for both three-phase and two-phase\ntwo-way relay protocols. Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive\ntransmission policies can efficiently provide QoS guarantees and improve the\nperformance. In addition, the throughput gain obtained by the considered\nthree-phase and two-phase protocols over direct transmission is significant\nwhen the delay-QoS requirements are loose, but the gain diminishes at tight\ndelay requirements. It is also found that, in the two-phase protocol, the relay\nnode should be placed closer to the source with more stringent delay\nrequirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 07:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

It can be applied, for example, to electoral processes, both\nelectronic and manual. It uses vote counts in officially published voting\nunits, which are typically widely available and institutionally backed. The\ntest examines the frequencies of digits on voting counts and rests on the First\n(NBL1) and Second Digit Newcomb--Benford Law (NBL2), and in a novel\ngeneralization of the law under restrictions of the maximum number of voters\nper unit (RNBL2). We apply the test to the 2004 USA presidential elections, the\nPuerto Rico (1996, 2000 and 2004) governor elections, the 2004 Venezuelan\npresidential recall referendum (RRP) and the previous 2000 Venezuelan\nPresidential election. The NBL2 is compellingly rejected only in the Venezuelan\nreferendum and only for electronic voting units. Our original suggestion on the\nRRP (Pericchi and Torres, 2004) was criticized by The Carter Center report\n(2005). Acknowledging this, Mebane (2006) and The Economist (US) (2007)\npresented voting models and case studies in favor of NBL2. Further evidence is\npresented here. Moreover, under the RNBL2, Mebane's voting models are valid\nunder wider conditions. The adequacy of the law is assessed through Bayes\nFactors (and corrections of $p$-values) instead of significance testing, since\nfor large sample sizes and fixed $\\alpha$ levels the null hypothesis is over\nrejected. Our tests are extremely simple and can become a standard screening\nthat a fair electoral process should pass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 08:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

These problems are NP-hard, so that several research efforts have\nbeen made in the literature for identifying tractable classes, known as islands\nof tractability, as well as for devising clever heuristics for solving\nefficiently real-world instances. Many heuristic approaches are based on\nenforcing on the given instance a property called local consistency, where (in\ndatabase terms) each tuple in every query atom matches at least one tuple in\nevery other query atom. Interestingly, it turns out that, for many well-known\nclasses of queries, such as for the acyclic queries, enforcing local\nconsistency is even sufficient to solve the given instance correctly. However,\nthe precise power of such a procedure was unclear, but for some very restricted\ncases.

The nodes are\nautonomous and make their own decisions. They also have limited energy\nresources. Thus, a node tends to behave selfishly when it is asked to forward\nthe packets of other nodes. Indeed, it would rather choose to reject a\nforwarding request in order to save its energy. To overcome this problem, the\nnodes need to be motivated to cooperate. To this end, we propose a\nself-learning repeated game framework to enforce cooperation between the nodes\nof a network. This framework is inspired by the concept of \"The Weakest Link\"\nTV game. Each node has a utility function whose value depends on its\ncooperation in forwarding packets on a route as well as the cooperation of all\nthe nodes that form this same route. The more these nodes cooperate the higher\nis their utility value. This would establish a cooperative spirit within the\nnodes of the networks. All the nodes will then more or less equally participate\nto the forwarding tasks which would then eventually guarantee a more efficient\npackets forwarding from sources to respective destinations.

Yet, in analogy to\nelectric interference, Maki and Griffin predicted in 1965 that thermal current\nflowing through a temperature-biased Josephson tunnel junction is a stationary\nperiodic function of the quantum phase difference between the superconductors.\nThe interplay between quasiparticles and Cooper pairs condensate is at the\norigin of such phase-dependent heat current, and is unique to Josephson\njunctions. In this scenario, a temperature-biased SQUID would allow heat\ncurrents to interfere thus implementing the thermal version of the electric\nJosephson interferometer. The dissipative character of heat flux makes this\ncoherent phenomenon not less extraordinary than its electric (non-dissipative)\ncounterpart.

Heat transport in the\nsystem is found to be phase dependent, in agreement with the original\nprediction.

We establish the existence of resonance free sectors adjoining any\ngiven Landau level and prove that the number of the resonances in the\ncomplementary sectors is infinite. Finally, we obtain the main asymptotic term\nof the local resonance counting function near an arbitrary fixed Landau level;\nthis main asymptotic term is again expressed via the Berezin-Toeplitz operators\nwhich govern the asymptotics of the SSF at the Landau levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 13:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 00:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-29"}

We use three independent volume-limited samples of\ngalaxies within z < 0.2 and Mr < -17.8. We investigate the known SFR-density\nrelationship and explore in detail the dependence of SFR on stellar mass and\ndensity. We show that the SFR-density trend is only visible when we include the\npassive galaxy population along with the star-forming population. This\nSFR-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-forming\npopulation of galaxies, consistent with previous work. While there is a strong\ndependence of the EWH?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that these\ntrends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationship\nis absent when considering a \"star-forming\" sample of galaxies. We find that\nstellar mass has the strongest influence on SFR and EWH?a with the environment\nhaving no significant effect on the star-formation properties of the star\nforming population. We also show that the SFR-density relationship is absent\nfor both early and late-type star-forming galaxies. We conclude that the\nstellar mass has the largest impact on the current SFR of a galaxy, and any\nenvironmental effect is not detectable. The observation that the trends with\ndensity are due to the changing morphology fraction with density implies that\nthe timescales must be very short for any quenching of the SFR in infalling\ngalaxies. Alternatively galaxies may in fact undergo predominantly in-situ\nevolution where the infall and quenching of galaxies from the field into dense\nenvironments is not the dominant evolutionary mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 13:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We observed 15 new candidates, detected with\nsignal-to-noise ratios between 4.0 and 6.1 in the 15.5-month nominal Planck\nsurvey. The candidates were selected using ancillary data flags derived from\nthe ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) and Digitized Sky Survey all-sky maps, with the\naim of pushing into the low SZ flux, high-z regime and testing RASS flags as\nindicators of candidate reliability. 14 new clusters were detected by XMM,\nincluding 2 double systems. Redshifts lie in the range 0.2 to 0.9, with 6\nclusters at z>0.5. Estimated M500 range from 2.5 10^14 to 8 10^14 Msun. We\ndiscuss our results in the context of the full XMM validation programme, in\nwhich 51 new clusters have been detected. This includes 4 double and 2 triple\nsystems, some of which are chance projections on the sky of clusters at\ndifferent z. We find that association with a RASS-BSC source is a robust\nindicator of the reliability of a candidate, whereas association with a FSC\nsource does not guarantee that the SZ candidate is a bona fide cluster.\nNevertheless, most Planck clusters appear in RASS maps, with a significance\ngreater than 2 sigma being a good indication that the candidate is a real\ncluster. The full sample gives a Planck sensitivity threshold of Y500 ~ 4 10^-4\narcmin^2, with indication for Malmquist bias in the YX-Y500 relation below this\nlevel. The corresponding mass threshold depends on z. Systems with M500 > 5\n10^14 Msun at z > 0.5 are easily detectable with Planck. The newly-detected\nclusters follow the YX-Y500 relation derived from X-ray selected samples.\nCompared to X-ray selected clusters, the new SZ clusters have a lower X-ray\nluminosity on average for their mass. There is no indication of departure from\nstandard self-similar evolution in the X-ray versus SZ scaling properties.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 14:02:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 08:56:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 16:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

In an earlier Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108,\n080601 (2012)], we addressed the degeneracy question: What is the number of\nmicrostructures compatible with a specified correlation function? We computed\nthis degeneracy, i.e., configurational entropy, in the framework of\nreconstruction methods, which enabled us to map the problem to the\ndetermination of ground-state degeneracies. Here, we provide a more\ncomprehensive presentation and additional results. Since the configuration\nspace of a reconstruction problem is a hypercube on which a Hamming distance is\ndefined, we can calculate analytically an energy profile corresponding to the\naverage energy of all microstructures at a given Hamming distance from a ground\nstate. The steepness of this profile is a measure of the roughness of the\nenergy landscape, which can be used as a proxy for ground-state degeneracy. The\nrelationship between roughness metric and ground-state degeneracy is calibrated\nusing a Monte Carlo algorithm for determining the degeneracy of a variety of\nmicrostructures, including hard disks and Poisson point processes as well as\nthose with known degeneracies (single disks of various sizes and a particular\ncrystalline microstructure). We show that our results can be expressed in terms\nof the information content of the two-point correlation functions. From this\nperspective, the a priori condition for a reconstruction to be accurate is that\nthe information content, expressed in bits, should be comparable to the number\nof pixels in the unknown microstructure. We provide a formula to calculate the\ninformation content of any two-point correlation function, which makes our\nresults broadly applicable to any field in which correlation functions are\nemployed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 14:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

Aggregation is an emergent phenomenon\narising from the interactions between the individuals of the population, able\nto sense only -at most- local densities of their cohorts. Thus, taking into\naccount the individual-level interactions and fluctuations is essential to\nreach a correct description of the population. Classic deterministic equations\nare suitable to describe some aspects of the population, but leave out features\nrelated to the stochasticity inherent to the discreteness of the individuals.\nStochastic equations for the population do account for these\nfluctuation-generated effects by means of demographic noise terms but, owing to\ntheir complexity, they can be difficult (or, at times, impossible) to deal\nwith. Even when they can be written in a simple form, they are still difficult\nto numerically integrate due to the presence of the \"square-root\" intrinsic\nnoise. In this paper, we discuss a simple way to add the effect of demographic\nstochasticity to three classic, deterministic ecological examples where\naggregation plays an important role. We study the resulting equations using a\nrecently-introduced integration scheme especially devised to integrate\nnumerically stochastic equations with demographic noise. Aimed at scrutinizing\nthe ability of these stochastic examples to show aggregation, we find that the\nthree systems not only show patchy configurations, but also undergo a phase\ntransition belonging to the directed percolation universality class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 14:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In\nApprox 2010, we introduced a Greedy approximation algorithm and claimed a ratio\nof 1.992. Here we improve the analysis to 1.85.\n  The proof also shows that a natural linear programming relaxation, introduced\nby us in 2012, has the same 1.85 integrality gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 14:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

The central tools of our approach are (i)\nthe conformal geometry of differential forms and the associated exterior\ntractor calculus, and (ii) a generalised notion of scale which encodes the\nconnection between the underlying geometry and its boundary. The latter also\ncontrols the breaking of conformal invariance in a very strict way by coupling\nconformally invariant equations to the scale tractor associated with the\ngeneralised scale. From this, we obtain a map from existing solutions to new\nones that exchanges Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
