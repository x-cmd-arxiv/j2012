The same frequencies are found in proxy and instrumental global surface\ntemperature records since 1650 and 1850, respectively and in several planetary\nand solar records. Thus, the aurora records reveal a physical link between\nclimate change and astronomical oscillations. Likely, there exists a modulation\nof the cosmic ray flux reaching the Earth and/or of the electric properties of\nthe ionosphere. The latter, in turn, have the potentiality of modulating the\nglobal cloud cover that ultimately drives the climate oscillations through\nalbedo oscillations. In particular, a quasi 60-year large cycle is quite\nevident since 1650 in all climate and astronomical records herein studied,\nwhich also include an historical record of meteorite fall in China from 619 to\n1943. These findings support the thesis that climate oscillations have an\nastronomical origin.

The spectra of most of the diffuse emission regions within the\nremnant are best described by a thermal+non-thermal model. The thermal\ncomponent is described by a plane-parallel, non-equilibrium ionization plasma\nmodel with a temperature ranging from 1.3 keV in the western side of the\nremnant to 2.3 keV in the east, a column density increasing from 1.0e22 cm^-2\nin the west to 1.8e22 cm^-2 in the east, and a low ionization timescale ranging\nfrom 5.7e9 cm^-3 s in the SNR interior to 3.6e10 cm^-3 s in the western side -\nsuggestive of expansion of a young remnant in a low-density medium. The spatial\nand spectral differences across the SNR are consistent with the presence of a\ndark cloud in the eastern part of the SNR, absorbing the soft X-ray emission.\nThe spectra from some of the regions also show slightly enhanced metal\nabundances from Ne, Mg and Si, hinting at the first evidence for ejecta heated\nby the reverse shock.

In this paper (Paper II), we outline\nthe observations and data reduction steps required for wide-band calibration\nand mapping of EVLA data, including polarization, based on C-array test\nobservations of NGC 4631.\n  With modest on-source observing times (30 minutes at 1.5 GHz and 75 minutes\nat 6 GHz for the test data) we have achieved best rms noise levels of 22 and\n3.5 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 1.5 GHz and 6 GHz, respectively. New disk-halo\nfeatures have been detected, among them two at 1.5 GHz that appear as loops in\nprojection. We present the first 1.5 GHz spectral index map of NGC 4631 to be\nformed from a single wide-band observation in a single array configuration.\nThis map represents tangent slopes to the intensities within the band centered\nat 1.5 GHz, rather than fits across widely separated frequencies as has been\ndone in the past and is also the highest spatial resolution spectral index map\nyet presented for this galaxy. The average spectral index in the disk is\n$\\bar\\alpha_{1.5 GHz}\\,=\\,-0.84\\,\\pm\\,0.05$ indicating that the emission is\nlargely non-thermal, but a small global thermal contribution is sufficient to\nexplain a positive curvature term in the spectral index over the band. Two\nspecific star forming regions have spectral indices that are consistent with\nthermal emission. Polarization results (uncorrected for internal Faraday\nrotation) are consistent with previous observations and also reveal some new\nfeatures. On broad scales, we find strong support for the notion that magnetic\nfields constrain the X-ray emitting hot gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 18:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 14:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Many of\nthe newly discovered, SZ-selected clusters contain hot intracluster plasma (kTe\n> 10 keV) and exhibit disturbed morphology, indicative of frequent mergers with\nlarge peculiar velocity (v > 1000 km s^{-1}). It is well-known that for the\ninterpretation of the SZ signal from hot, moving galaxy clusters, relativistic\ncorrections must be taken into account, and in this work, we present a fast and\naccurate method for computing these effects. Our approach is based on an\nalternative derivation of the Boltzmann collision term which provides new\nphysical insight into the sources of different kinematic corrections in the\nscattering problem. This allows us to obtain a clean separation of kinematic\nand scattering terms which differs from previous works. We briefly mention\nadditional complications connected with kinematic effects that should be\nconsidered when interpreting future SZ data for individual clusters. One of the\nmain outcomes of this work is SZpack, a numerical library which allows very\nfast and precise (<~0.001% at frequencies h nu <~ 20kT_g) computation of the SZ\nsignals up to high electron temperature (kT_e ~ 25 keV) and large peculiar\nvelocity (v/c ~ 0.01). The accuracy is well beyond the current and future\nprecision of SZ observations and practically eliminates uncertainties related\nto more expensive numerical evaluation of the Boltzmann collision term. Our new\napproach should therefore be useful for analyzing future high-resolution,\nmulti-frequency SZ observations as well as computing the predicted SZ effect\nsignals from numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 19:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 16:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However, the current experimental constraints\non stop squarks are much weaker, due to the smaller production cross section\nand difficult backgrounds. While light stops are motivated by naturalness\narguments, it has been suggested that such particles become nearly impossible\nto detect near the limit where their mass is degenerate with the sum of the\nmasses of their decay products. We show that this is not the case, and that\nsearches based on missing transverse energy (MET) have significant reach for\nstop masses above 175 GeV, even in the degenerate limit. We consider direct\npair production of stops, decaying to invisible LSPs and tops with either\nhadronic or semi-leptonic final states.

This multi-epoch abundance\nmatching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite\ngalaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We\nemploy a redshift-dependent parameterization of the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with\ngalaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several\nredshifts be reproduced simultaneously. Using merger trees extracted from the\ndark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average\nassembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the\ngalaxies (in-situ) and accretion of stars (ex-situ). The peak star formation\nefficiency decreases with redshift from 23% at z=0 to 9% at z=4 while the\ncorresponding halo mass increases from 10^11.8M\\odot to 10^12.5M\\odot. The star\nformation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo\nmass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass\ngalaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the\nMilky-Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z=0.7. In\nlow-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly\nof their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the\ncentral stellar mass is formed ex-situ with significant accretion of satellites\nat z<2.

This is accomplished by calculating the polarized quark\nspin flip probabilities after a pseudoscalar hadron emission and the elementary\nCollins functions. The model is used to calculate the number densities of the\nhadrons produced in the polarized quark's decay chain. The full Collins\nfragmentation function is extracted from the sine modulation of the polarized\nnumber densities with respect to the polar angle between the initial quark's\nspin and hadron's transverse momentum. Two cases are studied here. First, a toy\nmodel for elementary Collins function is used to study the features of the\ntransversely polarized quark-jet model. Second, a full model calculation of\ntransverse momentum dependent pion and kaon Collins functions is presented. The\nremarkable feature of our model is that the 1/2 moments of the favored Collins\nfragmentation functions are positive and peak at large values of z but decrease\nand oscillate at small values of z. The 1/2 moments of the unfavored Collins\nfunctions have comparable magnitude and opposite sign to the favored functions,\nvanish at large z and peak at small values of z. This feature is observed for\nboth the toy and full models and can be attributed to the quark-jet picture of\nhadronization. Moreover, the transverse momentum dependencies of the model\nCollins functions differ significantly from the Gaussian form widely used in\nthe empirical parametrizations. Finally, a naive interpretation of the\nSchafer-Teryaev sum rule is proven not to hold in our model, where the\ntransverse momentum conservation is explicitly enforced. This is attributed to\nthe sizable average transverse momentum of the remnant quark that needs to be\naccounted for to satisfy the transverse momentum sum-rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 20:02:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-30"}

One fundamental issue is that we do not know the spatial scale of the\ncoronal heating mechanism. At a spatial resolution of 1000 km or more it is\nlikely that most observations represent superpositions of multiple unresolved\nstructures. In this letter, we use a combination of spectroscopic data from the\nHinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and high resolution images from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory to\ndetermine the spatial scales of coronal loops. We use density measurements to\nconstruct multi-thread models of the observed loops and confirm these models\nusing the higher spatial resolution imaging data. The results allow us to set\nconstraints on the number of threads needed to reproduce a particular loop\nstructure. We demonstrate that in several cases million degree loops are\nrevealed to be single monolithic structures that are fully spatially resolved\nby current instruments. The majority of loops, however, must be composed of a\nnumber of finer, unresolved threads; but the models suggest that even for these\nloops the number of threads could be small, implying that they are also close\nto being resolved.

After surviving\nperihelion, the comet underwent major changes (permanent loss of nuclear\ncondensation, formation of spine tail). The process of disintegration\nculminated with an outburst on December 17.6 (T+1.6 d) and this delayed\nresponse is inconsistent with the rubble pile model. Probable cause was thermal\nstress from the heat pulse into the nucleus after perihelion, which could also\nproduce fragmentation of sungrazers far from the Sun. The spine tail was a\nsynchronic feature, made up of dust released at <30 m/s. Since the nucleus\nwould have been located on the synchrone, we computed the astrometric positions\nof the missing nucleus as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the\nspine tail's axis with lines of forced orbital-period variation, derived from\norbital solutions based on preperihelion astrometry from the ground. The\nresulting osculating orbital period was 698+/-2 years, which proves that C/2011\nW3 is the first major member of the predicted new, 21st-century cluster of\nbright Kreutz-system sungrazers. The spine tail's tip contained dust 1-2 mm in\ndiameter. The bizarre appearance of the dust tail in images taken hours after\nperihelion with coronagraphs on SOHO and STEREO is readily understood. The\ndisconnection of the comet's head from the preperihelion tail and the apparent\nactivity attenuation near perihelion are both caused by sublimation of all dust\nat heliocentric distances smaller than ~1.8 solar radii. The tail's brightness\nis strongly affected by forward scattering of sunlight by dust. The\nlongest-imaged grains had a radiation-pressure parameter beta ~ 0.6, probably\nsubmicron-sized silicate grains. The place of C/2011 W3 within the hierarchy of\nthe Kreutz system and its genealogy via a 14th century parent suggest that it\nis indirectly related to the celebrated sungrazer X/1106 C1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2012 00:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Here we propose a framework for\nextracting combinatorial realizations from the geometric picture: We construct\ncertain torus actions on the quiver varieties and use Morse theory to index the\nirreducible components by connected components of the subvariety of torus fixed\npoints. We then discuss the case of affine sl(n).

Under the conventional single-cell\nsetup, RBF is known to achieve the optimal sum-capacity scaling law as the\nnumber of users goes to infinity, thanks to the multiuser diversity enabled\ntransmission scheduling that virtually eliminates the intra-cell interference.\nIn this paper, we extend the study of RBF to a more practical multi-cell\ndownlink system with single-antenna receivers subject to the additional\ninter-cell interference (ICI). First, we consider the case of finite\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each receiver. We derive a closed-form\nexpression of the achievable sum-rate with the multi-cell RBF, based upon which\nwe show an asymptotic sum-rate scaling law as the number of users goes to\ninfinity. Next, we consider the high-SNR regime and for tractable analysis\nassume that the number of users in each cell scales in a certain order with the\nper-cell SNR. Under this setup, we characterize the achievable degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) for the single-cell case with RBF. Then we extend the analysis to\nthe multi-cell RBF case by characterizing the DoF region. It is shown that the\nDoF region characterization provides useful guideline on how to design a\ncooperative multi-cell RBF system to achieve optimal throughput tradeoffs among\ndifferent cells. Furthermore, our results reveal that the multi-cell RBF scheme\nachieves the \"interference-free DoF\" region upper bound for the multi-cell\nsystem, provided that the per-cell number of users has a sufficiently large\nscaling order with the SNR. Our result thus confirms the optimality of\nmulti-cell RBF in this regime even without the complete CSI at the transmitter,\nas compared to other full-CSI requiring transmission schemes such as\ninterference alignment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2012 02:56:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 02:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 May 2013 01:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

In this case, teams of oppositely\npulling motors (eg., kinesin and dynein) bind to the cargo simultaneously, and\n`coordinate' their activity such that the motion consists of spells of\npositively and negatively directed segments, separated by pauses of varying\nduration. A set of recent experiments have analyzed the bidirectional motion of\nendosomes in the amoeba D. discoideum in detail. It was found that in between\ndirectional switches, a team of 5-6 dyneins stall a cargo against a stronger\nkinesin in tug of war, which lasts for almost a second. As the mean detachment\ntime of a kinesin under its stall load was also observed to be ~ 1s, we infer\nthat the collective detachment time of the dynein assembly must also be\nsimilar. Here, we analyze this inference from a modeling perspective, using\nexperimentally measured single-molecule parameters as inputs. We find that the\ncommonly assumed exponential load-dependent detachment rate is inconsistent\nwith observations, as it predicts that a 5-dynein assembly will detach under\nits combined stall load in less than a hundredth of a second. A modified model\nwhere the load-dependent unbinding rate is assumed to saturate at stall-force\nlevel for super-stall loads gives results which are in agreement with\nexperimental data.

A\ntraditional estimation procedure in use is the following two-step approach: the\nmodel is estimated by maximum likelihood method and then a rotation technique\nis utilized to find sparse factor loadings. However, the maximum likelihood\nestimates cannot be obtained when the number of variables is much larger than\nthe number of observations. Furthermore, even if the maximum likelihood\nestimates are available, the rotation technique does not often produce a\nsufficiently sparse solution. In order to handle these problems, this paper\nintroduces a penalized likelihood procedure that imposes a nonconvex penalty on\nthe factor loadings. We show that the penalized likelihood procedure can be\nviewed as a generalization of the traditional two-step approach, and the\nproposed methodology can produce sparser solutions than the rotation technique.\nA new algorithm via the EM algorithm along with coordinate descent is\nintroduced to compute the entire solution path, which permits the application\nto a wide variety of convex and nonconvex penalties. Monte Carlo simulations\nare conducted to investigate the performance of our modeling strategy. A real\ndata example is also given to illustrate our procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2012 10:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 14:28:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 11:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-18"}

However, different events can exhibit\ndifferent features because of the quantum mechanical nature of the underlying\nphysics processes. While signal and background fractions in a given data set\ncan be evaluated using a maximum likelihood estimator, the shapes of the\ncorresponding distributions are traditionally obtained using high-statistics\ncontrol samples, which normally neglects the effect of fluctuations. On the\nother hand, if it was possible to subtract background using templates that take\nfluctuations into account, this would be expected to improve the resolution of\nthe observables of interest, and to reduce systematics depending on the\nanalysis. This study is an initial step in this direction. We propose a novel\nalgorithm inspired by the Gibbs sampler that makes it possible to estimate the\nshapes of signal and background probability density functions from a given\ncollection of particles, using control sample templates as initial conditions\nand refining them to take into account the effect of fluctuations. Results on\nMonte Carlo data are presented, and the prospects for future development are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2012 14:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 18:50:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 16:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

This spacing along with the interferometric radius for this star\nis used to derive an accurate stellar mass. A long time series of over 60 hours\nof precise stellar radial velocity measurements of Beta Gem were taken with an\niodine absorption cell and the echelle spectrograph mounted on the 2m Alfred\nJensch Telescope. Complementary photometric data for this star were also taken\nwith the MOST microsatellite spanning 3.6 d. A Fourier analysis of the radial\nvelocity data reveals the presence of up to 17 significant pulsation modes in\nthe frequency interval 10-250 micro-Hz. Most of these fall on a grid of\nequally-spaced frequencies having a separation of 7.14 +/- 0.12 micro-Hz. An\nanalysis of 3.6 days of high precision photometry taken with the MOST space\ntelescope shows the presence of up to 16 modes, six of which are consistent\nwith modes found in the spectral (radial velocity) data. This frequency spacing\nis consistent with high overtone radial pulsations; however, until the\npulsation modes are identified we cannot be sure if some of these are nonradial\nmodes or even mixed modes. The radial velocity frequency spacing along with\nangular diameter measurements of Beta Gem via interferometry results in a\nstellar mass of M = 1.91 +/- 0.09 solar masses. This value confirms the\nintermediate mass of the star determined using stellar evolutionary tracks.\nBeta Gem is confirmed to be an intermediate mass star. Stellar pulsations in\ngiant stars along with interferometric radius measurements can provide accurate\ndeterminations of the stellar mass of planet hosting giant stars. These can\nalso be used to calibrate stellar evolutionary tracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 May 2012 15:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
