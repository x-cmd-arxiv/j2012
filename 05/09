We make use of\npublished X-ray observations of ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) and new 43GHz VLBA\nimages to track the jet knots ejection. We find that the superluminal jet\ncoexists with the mildly relativistic outflows on sub-pc scales, possibly\nindicating a transverse stratification of a global flow. The two are roughly in\npressure equilibrium, with the UFOs potentially providing additional support\nfor the initial jet collimation. The UFOs are much more massive than the jet,\nbut their kinetic power is probably about an order of magnitude lower, at least\nfor the observations considered here. However, their momentum flux is\nequivalent and both of them are powerful enough to exert a concurrent feedback\nimpact on the surrounding environment. A link between these components is\nnaturally predicted in the context of MHD models for jet/outflow formation.\nHowever, given the high radiation throughput of AGNs, radiation pressure should\nalso be taken into account. From the comparison with the long-term 2-10keV RXTE\nlight curve we find that the UFOs are preferentially detected during periods of\nincreasing flux. We also find the possibility to place the UFOs within the\nknown X-ray dips-jet ejection cycles, which has been shown to be a strong proof\nof the disc-jet connection, in analogue with stellar-mass black holes. However,\ngiven the limited number of observations presently available, these relations\nare only tentative and additional spectral monitoring is needed to test them\nconclusively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 16:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Stuart Dowker's most significant achievements has been to observe\nthat the theory of diffraction by wedges developed a century ago by Sommerfeld\nand others provided the key to solving two problems of great interest in\ngeneral-relativistic quantum field theory during the last quarter of the\ntwentieth century: the vacuum energy associated with an infinitely thin,\nstraight cosmic string, and (after an interchange of time with a space\ncoordinate) the apparent vacuum energy of empty space as viewed by an\naccelerating observer. In a sense the string problem is more elementary than\nthe wedge, since Sommerfeld's technique was to relate the wedge problem to that\nof a conical manifold by the method of images. Indeed, Minkowski space, as well\nas all cone and wedge problems, are related by images to an infinitely sheeted\nmaster manifold, which we call Dowker space. We review the research in this\narea and exhibit in detail the vacuum expectation values of the energy density\nand pressure of a scalar field in Dowker space and the cone and wedge spaces\nthat result from it. We point out that the (vanishing) vacuum energy of\nMinkowski space results, from the point of view of Dowker space, from the\nquantization of angular modes, in precisely the way that the Casimir energy of\na toroidal closed universe results from the quantization of Fourier modes; we\nhope that this understanding dispels any lingering doubts about the reality of\ncosmological vacuum energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 20:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Collective cavity\ncooling of molecules is a promising method that does not rely on molecular\nenergy level and thus can be applied to all molecules in principle. However,\nthe initial lack of cold molecules leads to the difficulty in its experimental\nimplementation. We show that efficient collective sympathetic cooling of\nmolecules to sub-mK temperatures using a large ensemble of atoms within a\ncavity is feasible. This approach is a new type of sympathetic cooling which\ndoes not rely on direct collisions between atoms and molecules, but utilizes\nthermalization via their mutual interaction with a cavity field. Two important\nmechanisms are identified. This include: (1) giant enhancement of cavity\noptical field from the efficient scattering of the pump light by the atoms; (2)\ncavity-mediated collective interaction between the atoms and the molecules. We\nshow an optimal cavity detuning for maximizing cooling, which is dependent on\nthe atom and molecule numbers.

We show that the\nelectron-phonon interaction has important consequences on the dynamics,\nespecially when the quantum dot and cavity are tuned out of resonance, in which\ncase the phonons may add or remove energy leading to an effective non-resonant\ncoupling between quantum dot and cavity. The system is investigated using two\ndifferent theoretical approaches: (i) a second-order expansion in the bare\nphonon coupling constant, and (ii) an expansion in a polaron-photon coupling\nconstant, arising from the polaron transformation which allows an accurate\ndescription at high temperatures. In the low temperature regime we find\nexcellent agreement between the two approaches. An extensive study of the\nquantum dot decay dynamics is performed, where important parameter dependencies\nare covered. We find that in general the electron-phonon interaction gives rise\nto a greatly increased bandwidth of the coupling between quantum dot and\ncavity. At low temperature an asymmetry in the quantum dot decay rate is\nobserved, leading to a faster decay when the quantum dot has a larger energy\nthan to the cavity.

Each processor can access a subset of the graph networks.\nEach processor has a demand specified as a pair of vertices $<u, v>$, along\nwith a profit; the processor wishes to send data between $u$ and $v$. Towards\nthat goal, the processor needs to select a graph network accessible to it and a\npath connecting $u$ and $v$ within the selected network. The processor requires\nexclusive access to the chosen path, in order to route the data. Thus, the\nprocessors are competing for routes/channels. A feasible solution selects a\nsubset of demands and schedules each selected demand on a graph network\naccessible to the processor owning the demand; the solution also specifies the\npaths to use for this purpose. The requirement is that for any two demands\nscheduled on the same graph network, their chosen paths must be edge disjoint.\nThe goal is to output a solution having the maximum aggregate profit.

Dirac gauginos require the presence of chiral\nmultiplets in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, and the\nrealisation of such scenarios in F-theory is the subject of this paper. The\nchiral adjoints drastically alter the usual picture of gauge coupling\nunification, but this is disturbed anyway in F-theory models with non-trivial\nhypercharge flux. The interplay between these two factors is explored, and it\nis found for example that viable F-theory unification can be achieved at around\nthe reduced Planck scale, if there is an extra vector-like pair of singlet\nleptons with TeV-scale mass. I then discuss the conditions which must be\nsatisfied by the geometry and hypercharge flux of an F-theory model with Dirac\ngauginos. One nice possibility is for the visible sector to be localised on a\nK3 surface, and this is discussed in some detail. Finally, I describe how to\nachieve an unbroken discrete R-symmetry in such compactifications, which is an\nimportant ingredient in many models with Dirac gauginos, and write down a\nsimple example which has adjoint chiral multiplets, an appropriate R-symmetry,\nand allows for viable breaking of SU(5) by hypercharge flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 11:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 09:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 15:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-22"}

We start by presenting the general framework of perturbation\ntheory of gravitational instability in the expanding Universe and how it\napplies to the peculiar motion of the LG.

To improve estimation in RDS studies, we propose a new method to generate\nestimates with ego network data, which is collected by asking RDS respondents\nabout the composition of their personal networks, such as \"what proportion of\nyour friends are married?\". By simulations on an extracted real-world social\nnetwork of gay men as well as on artificial networks with varying structural\nproperties, we show that the new estimator, RDSI^{ego} shows superior\nperformance over traditional RDS estimators.

While the biases of traditional RDS estimators can sometimes be as\nlarge as 10%~20%, biases of all RDSI^{ego} estimates are well restrained to be\nless than 2%. The positive results henceforth encourage researchers to collect\nego network data for variables of interests by RDS, for both hard-to-access\npopulations and general populations when random sampling is not applicable.

Clearly the task of\ndesigning protocols for these networks is less difficult if the environment\nallows waiting (i.e., it provides the nodes with store-carry-forward-like\nmechanisms such as local buffering) than if waiting is not feasible. No\nquantitative corroborations of this fact exist (e.g., no answer to the\nquestion: how much easier?). In this paper, we consider these qualitative\nquestions about dynamic networks, modeled as time-varying (or evolving) graphs,\nwhere edges exist only at some times.\n  We examine the difficulty of the environment in terms of the expressivity of\nthe corresponding time-varying graph; that is in terms of the language\ngenerated by the feasible journeys in the graph. We prove that the set of\nlanguages $L_{nowait}$ when no waiting is allowed contains all computable\nlanguages. On the other end, using algebraic properties of quasi-orders, we\nprove that $L_{wait}$ is just the family of regular languages. In other words,\nwe prove that, when waiting is no longer forbidden, the power of the accepting\nautomaton (difficulty of the environment) drops drastically from being as\npowerful as a Turing machine, to becoming that of a Finite-State machine. This\n(perhaps surprisingly large) gap is a measure of the computational power of\nwaiting.\n  We also study bounded waiting; that is when waiting is allowed at a node only\nfor at most $d$ time units.

In order to increase the accuracy\nof the exposure time calculator of the European Southern Observatory's (ESO)\nVery Large Telescope (VLT) at Cerro Paranal, an atmospheric model was developed\nas part of the Austrian ESO In-Kind contribution. It includes all relevant\ncomponents, such as scattered moonlight, scattered starlight, zodiacal light,\natmospheric thermal radiation and absorption, and non-thermal airglow emission.\nThis paper focuses on atmospheric scattering processes that mostly affect the\nblue (< 0.55 mum) wavelength regime, and airglow emission lines and continuum\nthat dominate the red (> 0.55 mum) wavelength regime.

This paper studies the problem of learning kernels with\nthe same family of kernels but with an L2 regularization instead, and for\nregression problems. We analyze the problem of learning kernels with ridge\nregression. We derive the form of the solution of the optimization problem and\ngive an efficient iterative algorithm for computing that solution. We present a\nnovel theoretical analysis of the problem based on stability and give learning\nbounds for orthogonal kernels that contain only an additive term O(pp/m) when\ncompared to the standard kernel ridge regression stability bound. We also\nreport the results of experiments indicating that L1 regularization can lead to\nmodest improvements for a small number of kernels, but to performance\ndegradations in larger-scale cases. In contrast, L2 regularization never\ndegrades performance and in fact achieves significant improvements with a large\nnumber of kernels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 15:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}
