Near-infrared unbiased\nwide-field observations in the H2 1-0 S(1) line at 2.122{\\mu}m alleviates the\nproblem, enabling us to detect more outflows and trace them closer to their\ndriving sources. Aims. As part of a large-scale multi-waveband study of ongoing\nstar formation in the Braid Nebula Star Formation region, we focus on a one\nsquare degree region that includes Lynds Dark Nebula 1003 and 1004. Our goal is\nto find all of the near-infrared outflows, uncover their driving sources and\nestimate their evolutionary phase. Methods. We use near-infrared wide-field\nobservations obtained with WFCAM on UKIRT, in conjunction with\npreviously-published optical and archival MM data, to search for outflows and\nidentify their driving sources; we subsequently use colour-colour analysis to\ndetermine the evolutionary phase of each source. Results. Within a one square\ndegree field we have identified 37 complex MHOs, most of which are new. After\ncombining our findings with other wide-field, multi-waveband observations of\nthe same region we were able to discern 28 outflows and at least 18 protostars.\nOur analysis suggests that these protostars are younger and/or more energetic\nthan those of the Taurus-Auriga region.

The\npresent paper analyses such Coxeter groups in the Clifford Geometric Algebra\nframework, which affords a simple way of performing reflections and rotations\nwhilst exposing more clearly the underlying geometry. The Clifford approach\nshows that the quaternionic representations in fact have very simple geometric\ninterpretations. The representations of the groups A_1 x A_1 x A_1, A_3, B_3\nand H_3 of rank 3 in terms of pure quaternions are shown to be simply the Hodge\ndualised root vectors, which determine the reflection planes of the Coxeter\ngroups. Two successive reflections result in a rotation, described by the\ngeometric product of the two reflection vectors, giving a Clifford spinor. The\nspinors for the rank-3 groups A_1 x A_1 x A_1, A_3, B_3 and H_3 yield a new\nsimple construction of binary polyhedral groups. These in turn generate the\ngroups A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1, D_4, F_4 and H_4 of rank 4, and their widely used\nquaternionic representations are shown to be spinors in disguise. Therefore,\nthe Clifford geometric product in fact induces the rank-4 groups from the\nrank-3 groups. In particular, the groups D_4, F_4 and H_4 are exceptional\nstructures, which our study sheds new light on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 16:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-26"}

Assuming that adiabatic expansion losses are primarily\nresponsible for the jet intensity \"dimming\", two limiting cases are considered:\n[1] the jet has a constant speed on parsec-scales and is expanding gradually\nsuch that the jet radius $r\\propto d^0.4$; this expansion is however\nunobservable in the laterally unresolved jets at 5 GHz, and [2] the jet is\ncylindrical and is accelerating on parsec-scales. Accelerating parsec-scale\njets are consistent with the phenomenon of \"magnetic driving\" in Poynting flux\ndominated jets. Chandra observations of 15 UGC FRIs detect X-ray jets in nine\nof them. The high frequency of occurrence of X-ray jets in this complete sample\nsuggests that they are a signature of a ubiquitous process in FRI jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 16:53:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 18:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A reasonable model should not\nonly replicate all the structural properties that are observed in real world\nnetworks (for example, heavy tailed degree distributions, high clustering and\nsmall diameter), but it should also be amenable to mathematical analysis. There\nare plenty of models that succeed in the first task but are hard to analyze\nrigorously. On the other hand, a multitude of proposed models, like classical\nrandom graphs, can be studied mathematically, but fail in creating certain\naspects that are observed in real-world networks.\n  Recently, Papadopoulos, Krioukov, Boguna and Vahdat [INFOCOM'10] introduced a\nrandom geometric graph model that is based on hyperbolic geometry. The authors\nargued empirically and by some preliminary mathematical analysis that the\nresulting graphs have many of the desired properties. Moreover, by computing\nexplicitly a maximum likelihood fit of the Internet graph, they demonstrated\nimpressively that this model is adequate for reproducing the structure of real\ngraphs with high accuracy.\n  In this work we initiate the rigorous study of random hyperbolic graphs. We\ncompute exact asymptotic expressions for the expected number of vertices of\ndegree k for all k up to the maximum degree and provide small probabilities for\nlarge deviations. We also prove a constant lower bound for the clustering\ncoefficient. In particular, our findings confirm rigorously that the degree\nsequence follows a power-law distribution with controllable exponent and that\nthe clustering is nonvanishing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 17:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

We find that the emission from individual galaxies dominates over\nthe IGM with a total Lyman-alpha intensity (times frequency) of about\n(1.43-3.57)x10^{-8} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} at a redshift of 7.

Rewiring helps to maintain the diversity\nin the degree distribution of players and favors the spontaneous emergence of\ncooperative clusters.

The\ncorresponding perturbations are both scale invariant and special conformally\ninvariant. We exploit the operator product expansion technique of conformal\nfield theories to study the inflationary correlators enjoying the symmetries\npresent during the de Sitter epoch. The operator product expansion is\nparticularly powerful in characterizing inflationary correlation functions in\ntwo observationally interesting limits, the squeezed limit of the three-point\ncorrelator and the collapsed limit of the four-point correlator. Despite the\nfact that the shape of the four-point correlators is not fixed by the\nsymmetries of de Sitter, its exact shape can be found in the collapsed limit\nmaking use of the operator product expansion. By employing the fact that\nconformal invariance imposes the two-point cross-correlations of the light\nfields to vanish unless the fields have the same conformal weights, we are able\nto show that the Suyama-Yamaguchi inequality relating the coefficients $f_{\\rm\nNL}$ of the bispectrum in the squeezed limit and $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$ of the\ntrispectrum in the collapsed limit also holds when the light fields are\nintrinsically non-Gaussian. In fact, we show that the inequality is valid\nirrespectively of the conformal symmetry, being just a consequence of\nfundamental physical principles, such as the short-distance expansion of\noperator products. The observation of a strong violation of the inequality will\nthen have profound implications for inflationary models as it will imply either\nthat multifield inflation cannot be responsible for generating the observed\nfluctuations independently of the details of the model or that some new\nnon-trivial degrees of freedom play a role during inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 20:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial\ninstitution has when facing a CCP.\n  We show that a clearing member's CCP risk is given by a sum of exposures to\neach of the other clearing members. This arises because of the implicit default\ninsurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing\ncollateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital\nstructure of a CCP as well as the loss distributions of the individual member\nportfolios.\n  An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency\nwith respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of individual\nclearing members. To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for a typical\nCCP, margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio\nloss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined\nprobability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels.\n  A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account wrong-way\nrisk, i.e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed\nmarket conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member's default\nand the losses on his portfolio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 20:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-09"}

The results show that there exist two processes of the\nformation of the Peregrine rogue wave: one is the localized process of the\ncontinuous wave background, and the other is the reduction process of the\nperiodization of the bright soliton. The characteristics of the Peregrine rogue\nwave are exhibited by strong temporal and spatial localization. Also, various\ninitial excitations of the Peregrine rogue wave are performed and the results\nshow that the Peregrine rogue wave can be excited by a small localized (single\npeak) perturbation pulse of the continuous wave background, even for the\nnonintegrable case. The numerical simulations show that the Peregrine rogue\nwave is unstable. Finally, through a realistic example, the influence of the\nself-frequency shift to the dynamics of the Peregrine rogue wave is discussed.\nThe results show that in the absence of the self-frequency shift, the Peregrine\nrogue wave can split into several subpuslses; however, when the self-frequency\nshift is considered, the Peregrine rogue wave no longer splits and exhibits\nmainly a peak changing and an increasing evolution property of the field\namplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 05:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-09"}

The hybrid\nparticle-in-cell [PIC] code Zuma is run in tandem with the\nradiation-hydrodynamics code Hydra to model fast-electron propagation, fuel\nheating, and thermonuclear burn. The fast electron source is based on a 3D\nexplicit-PIC laser-plasma simulation with the PSC code. This shows a quasi\ntwo-temperature energy spectrum, and a divergent angle spectrum (average\nvelocity-space polar angle of 52 degrees). Transport simulations with the\nPIC-based divergence do not ignite for > 1 MJ of fast-electron energy, for a\nmodest 70 micron standoff distance from fast-electron injection to the dense\nfuel. However, artificially collimating the source gives an ignition energy of\n132 kJ. To mitigate the divergence, we consider imposed axial magnetic fields.\nUniform fields ~50 MG are sufficient to recover the artificially collimated\nignition energy. Experiments at the Omega laser facility have generated fields\nof this magnitude by imploding a capsule in seed fields of 50-100 kG. Such\nimploded fields are however more compressed in the transport region than in the\nlaser absorption region. When fast electrons encounter increasing field\nstrength, magnetic mirroring can reflect a substantial fraction of them and\nreduce coupling to the fuel. A hollow magnetic pipe, which peaks at a finite\nradius, is presented as one field configuration which circumvents mirroring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 05:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

One possible effect of such an interaction\nwould be a sheared magnetic field structure at the jet boundaries, leading to a\ncharacteristic radio polarization pattern. As proposed by Ostrowski, another\neffect can come from the generation of a high energy cosmic ray component at\nthe boundary, producing dynamic effects on the medium surrounding the jet and\nforming a cocoon dominated by cosmic rays with a decreased thermal gas\nemissivity. We selected this process for our first attempt to look for the\neffects of this type of interaction. We analyzed the Chandra X-ray data for the\nradio galaxy M87 in order to verify if the expected regions of diminished\nemissivity may be present near the spectacular X-ray jet in this source.

Specifically, for D3/D3 model there is no peak at\nnonzero frequency for the imaginary part of the conductivity, which is present\nin the nonconformal models; their asymptotic behaviors are different-for D1/D5\nthe real part of the AC conductivity approaches one at large frequency limit,\nfor D2/D4 it slowly goes to a certain nonzero constant smaller than one and for\nD3/D3 it goes to zero. We find the profile of the AC conductivity for the D1/D5\nsystem is very similar to that of higher dimensional p-wave superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 07:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2012 21:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-21"}

GPS is the most common positioning technique for\nVANET. However, it is not accurate. Moreover, the GPS signals cannot be\nreceived in the tunnels, undergrounds, or near tall buildings. Thus, no\npositioning service can be obtained in these locations. Even if the Deferential\nGPS (DGPS) can provide high accuracy, but still no GPS converge in these\nlocations. In this paper, we provide positioning techniques for VANET that can\nprovide accurate positioning service in the areas where GPS signals are\nhindered by the obstacles. Experimental results show significant improvement in\nthe accuracy. This allows when combined with DGPS the continuity of a precise\npositioning service that can be used by most of the VANET applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 09:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-09"}

It is interesting then to establish which aspects\nof our current theories afford us the convenient abstraction of a spacetime. I\nemphasize the role played by the assumed triviality of the geometry of momentum\nspace, which makes room for an observer-independent notion of locality. This is\nrelevant for some recent studies of the quantum-gravity problem that stumbled\nupon hints of a nontrivial geometry of momentum space, something which had been\nstrikingly envisaged for quantum gravity already in 1938 by Max Born. If indeed\nmomentum space has nontrivial geometry then the abstraction of a spacetime\nbecomes more evidently redundant and less convenient: one may still abstract a\nspacetime but only allowing for the possibility of a relativity of spacetime\nlocality. I also provide some examples of how all this could affect our\nattitude toward the quantum-gravity problem, including some for the program of\nemergent gravity and emergent spacetime and an indication of triviality of the\nholographic description of black holes.

We present calving-event data obtained\nfrom continuous observations of the termini of two tidewater glaciers on\nSvalbard, and show that the distributions of event sizes and inter-event\nintervals can be reproduced by a simple calving model focusing on the mutual\ninterplay between calving and the destabilization of the glacier terminus. The\nevent-size distributions of both the field and the model data extend over\nseveral orders of magnitude and resemble power laws. The distributions of\ninter-event intervals are broad, but have a less pronounced tail. In the model,\nthe width of the size distribution increases with the calving susceptibility of\nthe glacier terminus, a parameter measuring the effect of calving on the stress\nin the local neighborhood of the calving region. Inter-event interval\ndistributions, in contrast, are insensitive to the calving susceptibility.\nAbove a critical susceptibility, small perturbations of the glacier result in\nongoing self-sustained calving activity. The model suggests that the shape of\nthe event-size distribution of a glacier is informative about its proximity to\nthis transition point.

The subclusters we analyse, with populations of a\nfew hundred stars, have high local star formation efficiencies and are roughly\nvirialised even after the gas is removed. Over 10 Myr they expand to a similar\ndegree as would be expected from gas expulsion if they were initially gas-rich,\nbut the expansion is purely due to the internal stellar dynamics of the young\nclusters. The expansion is such that the stellar densities at 2 Myr match those\nof YSOs in the Solar neighborhood.

The\nnucleation process is governed by the vanishing of the energy associated with a\nsingle normal mode. This critical mode is largely confined to a single plane of\nadjacent atoms. For fixed film thickness, L, the spatial extent, \\xi, of the\ncritical mode grows with indenter radius, R. For fixed R/L, the spatial extent\n\\xi, grows roughly as \\xi ~ L^0.4. We, furthermore, perform a mesoscale\nanalysis to determine the lowest energy normal mode for mesoscale regions of\nvarying radius, r_{meso}, centered on the critical mode's core. The energy,\n\\lambda_{meso}, of the lowest normal mode in the meso-region decays very\nrapidly with r_{meso} and \\lambda_{meso} ~= 0 for r_{meso} >~ \\xi. The lowest\nnormal mode shows a spatial extent, \\xi_{meso}, which has a sublinear power-law\nincrease with r_{meso} for r_{meso} <~ \\xi, and saturates at r_{meso} \\gtrsim\n1.5\\xi.

For state-dependent graphs defined by a\n$\\mu$-nearest-neighbor rule, where each node interacts with its $\\mu$ nearest\nsmaller neighbors and the $\\mu$ nearest larger neighbors, we show that $\\mu+1$\nis a critical threshold on the total number of nodes for the transit from\nfinite-time to asymptotic convergence for averaging, in the absence of node\nself-confidence. The threshold is $2\\mu$ if each node chooses to connect only\nto neighbors with unique values. Numerical examples illustrate the tightness of\nthe conditions. The results characterize some fundamental similarities and\ndifferences between distributed averaging and maximizing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 May 2012 15:59:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 14:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-06"}

At collider experiments, b taggers allow one to distinguish particle\njets containing B hadrons from other jets; these algorithms have been used for\nmany years with great success at CDF. HOBIT has been designed specifically for\nuse in searches for light Higgs bosons decaying via H ! b\\bar{b}. This fact\ncombined with the extent to which HOBIT synthesizes and extends the best ideas\nof previous taggers makes HOBIT unique among CDF b-tagging algorithms.\nEmploying feed-forward neural network architectures, HOBIT provides an output\nvalue ranging from approximately -1 (\"light-jet like\") to 1 (\"b-jet like\");\nthis continuous output value has been tuned to provide maximum sensitivity in\nlight Higgs boson search analyses. When tuned to the equivalent light jet\nrejection rate, HOBIT tags 54% of b jets in simulated 120 GeV/c2 Higgs boson\nevents compared to 39% for SecVtx, the most commonly used b tagger at CDF. We\npresent features of the tagger as well as its characterization in the form of\nb-jet finding efficiencies and false (light-jet) tag rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 19:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\nquestion of why the motions of the SP are determined by the two types of\nsymmetry: internal symmetry of the system and symmetry of space and how it\nleads to two types of energy and forces accordingly are discussed.
