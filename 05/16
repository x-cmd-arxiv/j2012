In addition, whereas the variance of\nthe cosmological signal decreases on scales larger than the typical size of\nionization bubbles, the variance of the formidable galactic foregrounds\nincreases, making it hard to disentangle the two on such large scales. The poor\nsensitivity on small scales on the one hand, and the foregrounds effect on\nlarge scales on the other hand, make direct imaging of the Epoch of\nReionization of the Universe very difficult, and detection of the signal\ntherefore is expected to be statistical.Despite these hurdles, in this paper we\nargue that for many reionization scenarios low resolution images could be\nobtained from the expected data. This is because at the later stages of the\nprocess one still finds very large pockets of neutral regions in the IGM,\nreflecting the clustering of the large-scale structure, which stays strong up\nto scales of \\sim 120 comoving Mpc/h (\\sim 1 degree). The coherence of the\nemission on those scales allows us to reach sufficient S/N (\\sim 3) so as to\nobtain reionization 21 cm images. Such images will be extremely valuable for\nanswering many cosmological questions but above all they will be a very\npowerful tool to test our control of the systematics in the data. The existence\nof this typical scale (\\sim 120 comoving Mpc/h) also argues for designing\nfuture EoR experiments, e.g., with SKA, with a field of view of at least 4\ndegree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 17:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 09:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Converging flows with strong magnetic fields of different polarity\ncan accelerate particles through magnetic reconnection. If the particle mean\nfree path is longer than the reconnection layer is thick, but much shorter than\nthe entire reconnection structure, the particle will mostly interact with the\nincoming flows potentially with a very low escape probability. Aims. We\nexplore, in general and also in some specific scenarios, the possibility of\nparticles to be accelerated in a magnetic reconnection layer by interacting\nonly with the incoming flows. Methods. We characterize converging flows that\nundergo magnetic reconnection, and derive analytical estimates for the particle\nenergy distribution, acceleration rate, and maximum energies achievable in\nthese flows. We also discuss a scenario, based on jets dominated by magnetic\nfields of changing polarity, in which this mechanism may operate. Results. The\nproposed acceleration mechanism operates if the reconnection layer is much\nthinner than its transversal characteristic size, and the magnetic field has a\ndisordered component. Synchrotron losses may prevent electrons from entering in\nthis acceleration regime. The acceleration rate should be faster, and the\nenergy distribution of particles harder than in standard diffusive shock\nacceleration. The interaction of obstacles with the innermost region of jets in\nactive galactic nuclei and microquasars may be suitable sites for particle\nacceleration in converging flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 17:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 10:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Here we focus on a subclass of these events, where the light\ncurve is also tens of days wide, so the total radiated energy is order 10^{51}\nerg. If the origin of these SLSNe is a core-collapse-driven explosion of a\nmassive star, then the mechanism which converts the explosion energy into\nradiation must be very efficient (much more than in typical core collapse SNe,\nwhere this efficiency is of order one percent). We examine the scenario where\nthe radiated luminosity is due to efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the\nejected stellar envelope into radiation by interaction with an optically thick,\npre-existing circumstellar material (CSM), presumably the product of a steady\nwind from the progenitor. We base the analysis on a simple, numerically solved,\nhydrodynamic diffusion model, which allows us to identify the qualitative\nbehavior of the observable light curves, and to relate them to the parameters\nof the wind. We specifically show that a wide and superluminous supernova\nrequires the mass of the relevant wind material to be comparable to that of\nejected material from the exploding progenitor. We find the wind parameters\nwhich explain the peak luminosity and width of the bolometric light curves of\nthree particular SLSNe, namely, SN 2005ap, SN 2006gy, and SN 2010gx, and show\nthat they are best fitted with a wind that extends to a radius of order 10^{15}\ncm.

A robust prediction of the model is that the\nevolution of the nuclear black hole and of the host galaxy are tightly coupled\nby quasar feedback in the form of strong galaxy-scale winds. In the present\nletter, we show that the gas outflow rate predicted by GAMETE/QSOdust is in\ngood agreement with the lower limit of 3500 Msun/yr inferred by the\nobservations. According to the model, the observed outflow at z = 6.4 is\ndominated by quasar feedback, as the outflow rate has already considerably\ndepleted the gas content of the host galaxy, leading to a down-turn in the star\nformation rate at z < 7 - 8.

First, the convective fluxes and kinetic energies in the\nneutrino-heated region are consistent with expectations of buoyancy-driven\nconvection.

However, it has been argued that the production\nof large-scale magnetic fields by mean-field dynamo action is strongly\nsuppressed at large magnetic Reynolds numbers owing to the conservation of\nmagnetic helicity. This phenomenon is known as {\\it catastrophic quenching}.\nAdvection of magnetic fields by stellar and galactic winds toward the outer\nboundaries and away from the dynamo is expected to alleviate such quenching.\nHere we explore the relative roles played by advective and turbulent--diffusive\nfluxes of magnetic helicity in the dynamo. In particular, we study how the\ndynamo is affected by advection. We do this by performing direct numerical\nsimulations of a turbulent dynamo of $\\alpha^2$ type driven by forced\nturbulence in a Cartesian domain in the presence of a flow away from the\nequator where helicity changes sign. Our results indicate that in the presence\nof advection, the dynamo, otherwise stationary, becomes oscillatory. We confirm\nan earlier result for turbulent--diffusive magnetic helicity fluxes that for\nsmall magnetic Reynolds numbers ($\\Rm\\lesssim 100...200$, based on the\nwavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies) the magnetic helicity flux scales\nless strongly with magnetic Reynolds number ($\\Rm^{-1/2}$) than the term\ndescribing magnetic helicity destruction by resistivity ($\\Rm^{-1}$). Our new\nresults now suggest that for larger $\\Rm$ the former becomes approximately\nindependent of $\\Rm$, while the latter falls off more slowly.

Taylor's power\nlaw (Taylor 1961: Nature, 189:732-) is well recognized as one of the\nfundamental models in population ecology. A fundamental property of biological\npopulations, which Taylor's power law reveals, is the near universal\nheterogeneity of population abundance distribution in habitat. Obviously, the\nheterogeneity also exists at the community level, where not only the\ndistributions of population abundances but also the proportions of the species\ncomposition in the community are often heterogeneous. Nevertheless, existing\ncommunity diversity indexes such as Shannon index and Simpson index can only\nmeasure \"local\" or \"static\" diversity in the sense that they are computed for\neach habitat at a specific time point, and the indexes alone do not reflect the\ndiversity changes. In this note, I propose to extend the application scope of\nTaylor's power law to the studies of human microbial communities, specifically,\nthe community heterogeneity at both population and community levels. I further\nsuggested that population dispersion models such as Taylor (1980: Nature, 286,\n53-), which is known to generate population distribution patterns consistent\nwith the power law, should also be very useful for analyzing the distribution\npatterns of human microbes within the human body. Overall, I hope that the\napproach to human microbial community with the power law offers an example that\necological theories can play an important role in the emerging medical ecology,\nwhich aims at studying the ecology of human microbiome and its implications to\nhuman diseases and health, as well as in personalized medicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 20:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-17"}

Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that\ncause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine the\ntheory of the equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely\nconvective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular,\nwe examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor\nQ, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered\nstar or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is\nreduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This\ngenerates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide\nwhich is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is\ndissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an\neddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a\nsecond velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature\nwith the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the\ndisturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations,\nfrom which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the\nsystem evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and\nspecifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the\nthickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low\nfrequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a\nconstant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 01:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The produced maps are useful for analyzing regional climate influence\non building performance indicators such as energy use and indoor climate. This\nis shown using the Bestest building as a reference benchmark. An important\napplication of the mapping tool is the visualization of potential building\nmeasures over the EU. Also the performances of single building components can\nbe simulated and mapped. It is concluded that the presented method is efficient\nas it takes less than 15 minutes to simulate and produce the maps on a\n2.6GHz/4GB computer. Moreover, the approach is applicable for any type of\nbuilding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 06:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-17"}

For stable non-Markovian\nsystems, the non-adiabatic entropy production satisfies an integral fluctuation\ntheorem, leading to the second law of thermodynamics for transitions between\nnon-equilibrium steady-states. This quantity can also be written as a sum of\nproducts of generalized fluxes and forces, thus being suitable for\nthermodynamics.

Such particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations require a method to\ngenerate multivariate particle distributions as starting conditions.\n  In a preceeding publications it has been shown that the generators of\nsymplectic transformations in two dimensions are a subset of the real Dirac\nmatrices (RDMs) and that few symplectic transformations are required to\ntransform a quadratic Hamiltonian into diagonal form.\n  Here we argue that the use of RDMs is well suited for the generation of\nmultivariate normal distributions with arbitrary covariances. A direct and\nsimple argument supporting this claim is that this is the \"natural\" way how\nsuch distributions are formed. The transport of charged particle beams may\nserve as an example: An uncorrelated gaussian distribution of particles\nstarting at some initial position of the accelerator is subject to linear\ndeformations when passing through various beamline elements. These deformations\ncan be described by symplectic transformations.\n  Hence, if it is possible to derive the symplectic transformations that bring\nup these covariances, it is also possible to produce arbitrary multivariate\nnormal distributions without Cholesky decomposition. The method allows the use\nof arbitrary uncoupled distributions. The functional form of the coupled\nmultivariate distributions however depends in the general case on the type of\nthe used random number generator. Only gaussian generators always yield\ngaussian multivariate distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 09:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-17"}

The goal is to\ncompute a min-cost tree S which spans all terminals. In this paper we consider\nthe min-power version of the problem, which is better suited for wireless\napplications. Here, the goal is to minimize the total power consumption of\nnodes, where the power of a node v is the maximum cost of any edge of S\nincident to v. Intuitively, nodes are antennas (part of which are terminals\nthat we need to connect) and edge costs define the power to connect their\nendpoints via bidirectional links (so as to support protocols with ack\nmessages). Differently from its min-cost counterpart, min-power Steiner tree is\nNP-hard even in the spanning tree case, i.e. when all nodes are terminals.\nSince the power of any tree is within once and twice its cost, computing a rho\n\\leq ln(4)+eps [Byrka et al.'10] approximate min-cost Steiner tree provides a\n2rho<2.78 approximation for the problem. For min-power spanning tree the same\napproach provides a 2 approximation, which was improved to 5/3+eps with a\nnon-trivial approach in [Althaus et al.'06]. Here we present an improved\napproximation algorithm for min-power Steiner tree. Our result is based on two\nmain ingredients. We prove the first decomposition theorem for min-power\nSteiner tree, in the spirit of analogous structural results for min-cost\nSteiner tree and min-power spanning tree. Based on this theorem, we define a\nproper LP relaxation, that we exploit within the iterative randomized rounding\nframework in [Byrka et al.'10]. A careful analysis provides a 3ln\n4-9/4+eps<1.91 approximation factor. The same approach gives an improved\n1.5+eps approximation for min-power spanning tree as well, matching the\napproximation factor in [Nutov and Yaroshevitch'09] for the special case of\nmin-power spanning tree with edge weights in {0,1}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 09:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-17"}

We use state-of-the-art, publically available,\nMillennium I and II simulations and the associated semi-analytical galaxy\ncatalogues to explore the time evolution of the fraction of massive galaxies\nthat have satellites, the number of satellites per galaxy, the projected\ndistance at which the satellite locate from the host galaxy, and the mass ratio\nbetween the host galaxies and their satellites. The three virtual galaxy\ncatalogues considered here, overproduce the fraction of galaxies with\nsatellites by a factor ranging between 1.5 and 6 depending on the epoch,\nwhereas the mean projected distance and ratio of the satellite mass over host\nmass are in closer agreement with data. The larger pull of satellites in the\nsemi-analytical samples could suggest that the size evolution found in previous\nhydrodynamical simulations is an artifact due to the larger number of infalling\nsatellites compared to the real Universe. These results advise to revise the\nphysical ingredients implemented in the semi-analytical models in order to\nreconcile the observed and computed fraction of galaxies with satellites, and\neventually, it would leave some room to other mechanisms explaining the galaxy\nsize growth not related to the minor merging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 09:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Here, we investigate the influence of a global liquid\nlayer on the obliquity of the Galilean satellites. Io most likely has a fully\nliquid core, while Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are thought to have an\ninternal global liquid water ocean beneath an external ice shell. We use a\nmodel for the obliquity based on a Cassini state model extended to the presence\nof an internal liquid layer and the internal gravitational and pressure torques\ninduced by the presence of this layer. We find that the obliquity of Io only\nweakly depends on the different internal structure models considered, because\nof the weak influence of the liquid core which is therefore almost impossible\nto detect through observations of the obliquity. The obliquity of Europa is\nalmost constant in time and its mean value is smaller (0.033-0.044 deg) with an\nocean than without (0.055 deg).

Methods: A determination of the dust temperature\nin a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere is used to calculate initial radial molecular\nabundance profiles. The abundances of selected cooling molecules corresponding\nto two different core ages are then extracted to determine the gas temperature\nat two time steps. The calculation is repeated in an iterative process yielding\nmolecular abundances consistent with the gas temperature. Line emission\nprofiles for selected substances are calculated using simulated abundance\nprofiles. Results: The gas temperature is a function of time; the gas heats up\nas the core gets older because the cooling molecules are depleted onto grain\nsurfaces. The contributions of the various cooling molecules to the total\ncooling power change with time. Radial chemical abundance profiles are\nnon-trivial: different species present varying degrees of depletion and in some\ncases inward-increasing abundances profiles, even at t > 10^5 years. Line\nemission simulations indicate that cores of different ages can present\nsignificantly different line emission profiles, depending on the tracer species\nconsidered. Conclusions: Chemical abundances and the associated line cooling\npower change as a function of time. Most chemical species are depleted onto\ngrain surfaces at densities exceeding ~10^5 cm^-3. Notable exceptions are NH_3\nand N2H^+; the latter is largely undepleted even at n_H~10^6 cm-3. On the other\nhand, chemical abundances are not significantly developed in regions of low gas\ndensity even at t~10^5 years, revealed by inward-increasing abundance\ngradients.

The mission concept\nuses a 3000 square centimeter effective area mirror (at 6 keV) to achieve\nunprecedented sensitivities for hard X-ray imaging spectrometry (5-70 keV) and\nfor broadband X-ray polarimetry (2-70 keV). BEST can make substantial\ncontributions to our understanding of the inner workings of accreting black\nholes, our knowledge about the fabric of extremely curved spacetime, and the\nevolution of supermassive black holes. BEST will allow for time resolved\nstudies of accretion disks. With a more than seven times larger mirror area and\na seven times wider bandpass than GEMS, BEST will take X-ray polarimetry to a\nnew level: it will probe the time variability of the X-ray polarization from\nstellar mass and supermassive black holes, and it will measure the polarization\nproperties in 30 independent energy bins. These capabilities will allow BEST to\nconduct tests of accretion disk models and the underlying spacetimes. With\nthree times larger mirror area and ten times better angular resolution than\nNuSTAR, BEST will be able to make deep field observations with a more than 15\ntimes better sensitivity than NuSTAR. The mission will be able to trace the\nevolution of obscured and unobscured black holes in the redshift range from\nzero to six, covering the most important epoch of supermassive black hole\ngrowth. The hard X-ray sensitivity of BEST will enable a deep census of\nnon-thermal particle populations. BEST will give us insights into AGN feedback\nby measuring the particle luminosity injected by AGNs into the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) of their hosts, and will map the emission from particles\naccelerated at large scale structure shocks. Finally, BEST has the potential to\nconstrain the equation of state of neutron stars (NS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 14:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-17"}

Thus, to the extent that quantum systems are free, in the\nsense of Conway and Kochen, there is a sense in which they are maximally free.\n  We also propose that laws of quantum evolution arise from a principle of\nprecedence, according to which the outcome of a measurement on a quantum system\nis selected randomly from the ensemble of outcomes of previous instances of the\nsame measurement on the same quantum system. This implies that dynamical laws\nfor quantum systems can evolve as the universe evolves, because new precedents\nare generated by the formation of new entangled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 15:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-17"}
