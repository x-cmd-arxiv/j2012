In this study, we pay attention\nto the emergence of community structures in transient process and the effects\nof community-based control strategies on epidemic spreading. First, by\nnormalizing modularity $Q$, we investigate the evolution of community\nstructures during the transient process, and find that very strong community\nstructures are induced by rewiring mechanism in the early stage of epidemic\nspreading, which remarkably delays the outbreaks of epidemic. Then we study the\neffects of control strategies started from different stages on the prevalence.\nBoth immunization and quarantine strategies indicate that it is not \"the\nearlier, the better\" for the implementing of control measures. And the optimal\ncontrol effect is obtained if control measures can be efficiently implemented\nin the period of strong community structure. For immunization strategy,\nimmunizing the S nodes on SI links and immunizing S nodes randomly have similar\ncontrol effects. Yet for quarantine strategy, quarantining the I nodes on SI\nlinks can yield far better effects than quarantining I nodes randomly. More\nsignificantly, community-based quarantine strategy plays more efficient\nperformance than community-based immunization strategy.

The method utilizes\na recent geometric theory of complex networks modeled as random geometric\ngraphs in hyperbolic spaces. The method replays the network's geometric growth,\nestimating at each time step the hyperbolic coordinates of new nodes in a\ngrowing network by maximizing the likelihood of the network snapshot in the\nmodel. We apply HyperMap to the AS Internet, and find that: 1) the method\nproduces meaningful results, identifying soft communities of ASs belonging to\nthe same geographic region; 2) the method has a remarkable predictive power:\nusing the resulting map, we can predict missing links in the Internet with high\nprecision, outperforming popular existing methods; and 3) the resulting map is\nhighly navigable, meaning that a vast majority of greedy geometric routing\npaths are successful and low-stretch. Even though the method is not without\nlimitations, and is open for improvement, it occupies a unique attractive\nposition in the space of trade-offs between simplicity, accuracy, and\ncomputational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2012 05:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2013 06:14:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 13:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

In this paper, we first prepare the discrete representations of the\nnonlinearly deformed $su(1,1)$ algebra. Then we extend the previous procedure\nto construct a discrete class of coherent states for a polynomial su(1,1)\nalgebra which contains the Barut-Girardello set and the Perelomov set of the\nSU(1,1) coherent states as special cases. We also construct coherent states for\nthe cubic algebra related to the conditionally solvable radial oscillator\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2012 09:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-22"}

We find that above ~5 keV, the modulation\ndepth decreases with the increasing energy, which is consistent with the\nmodulation being caused by both bound-free absorption and Compton scattering in\nthe stellar wind of the donor, with minima corresponding to the highest optical\ndepth, which occurs around the superior conjunction. We find a decrease of the\ndepth below ~3 keV, which appears to be due to re-emission of the absorbed\ncontinuum by the wind in soft X-ray lines. Based on the shape of the folded\nlight curves, any X-ray contribution from the jet in Cyg X-3, which emits\ngamma-rays detected at energies >0.1 GeV in soft spectral states, is found to\nbe minor up to ~100 keV.

We find that the analysis of the time series allows us to\ndetermine the 24 hr rotational period of the planet for most observing\ngeometries, due to large warm and cold areas, identified with geographic\nfeatures, which appear consecutively in the observer's planetary view. However,\nthe effects of global-scale meteorology can effectively mask the rotation for\nseveral days at a time. We also find that orbital time series exhibit a\nseasonal modulation, whose amplitude depends strongly on the latitude of the\nobserver but weakly on its ecliptic longitude. As no systematic difference of\nbrightness temperature is found between the dayside and nightside, the phase\nvariations of the Earth in the infrared range are negligible.
