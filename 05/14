The\nfusion of spatial locations and text descriptions in trajectories engenders a\nnew type of top-$k$ queries that take into account both aspects. Each\ntrajectory in consideration consists of a sequence of geo-spatial locations\nassociated with text descriptions. Given a user location $\\lambda$ and a\nkeyword set $\\psi$, a top-$k$ query returns $k$ trajectories whose text\ndescriptions cover the keywords $\\psi$ and that have the shortest match\ndistance. To the best of our knowledge, previous research on querying\ntrajectory databases has focused on trajectory data without any text\ndescription, and no existing work has studied such kind of top-$k$ queries on\ntrajectories. This paper proposes one novel method for efficiently computing\ntop-$k$ trajectories. The method is developed based on a new hybrid index,\ncell-keyword conscious B$^+$-tree, denoted by \\cellbtree, which enables us to\nexploit both text relevance and location proximity to facilitate efficient and\neffective query processing. The results of our extensive empirical studies with\nan implementation of the proposed algorithms on BerkeleyDB demonstrate that our\nproposed methods are capable of achieving excellent performance and good\nscalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 May 2012 16:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-15"}

There\nare many aspects of dynamical networks that require statistical considerations.\nIn this paper we focus on determining network structure. Estimating dynamic\nnetworks is a difficult task since the number of components involved in the\nsystem is very large. As a result, the number of parameters to be estimated is\nbigger than the number of observations. However, a characteristic of many\nnetworks is that they are sparse. For example, the molecular structure of genes\nmake interactions with other components a highly-structured and therefore\nsparse process.\n  Penalized Gaussian graphical models have been used to estimate sparse\nnetworks. However, the literature has focussed on static networks, which lack\nspecific temporal constraints. We propose a structured Gaussian dynamical\ngraphical model, where structures can consist of specific time dynamics, known\npresence or absence of links and block equality constraints on the parameters.\nThus, the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced and accuracy of the\nestimates, including the identification of the network, can be tuned up. Here,\nwe show that the constrained optimization problem can be solved by taking\nadvantage of an efficient solver, logdetPPA, developed in convex optimization.\nMoreover, model selection methods for checking the sensitivity of the inferred\nnetworks are described.

In this setting, N points are chosen randomly on a hyperbolic space and\nany two of them are joined by an edge with probability that depends on their\nhyperbolic distance, independently of every other pair. In particular, when the\npositions of the points have been fixed, the distribution over the set of\ngraphs on these points is the Boltzmann distribution, where the Hamiltonian is\ngiven by the sum of weighted indicator functions for each pair of points, with\nthe weight being proportional to a real parameter \\beta>0 (interpreted as the\ninverse temperature) as well as to the hyperbolic distance between the\ncorresponding points. This class of random graphs was introduced by Krioukov et\nal. We provide a rigorous analysis of aspects of this model and its dependence\non the parameter \\beta, verifying some of their observations. We show that a\nphase transition occurs around \\beta =1. More specifically, we show that when\n\\beta > 1 the degree of a typical vertex is bounded in probability (in fact it\nfollows a distribution which for large values exhibits a power-law tail whose\nexponent depends only on the curvature of the space), whereas for \\beta <1 the\ndegree is a random variable whose expected value grows polynomially in N. When\n\\beta = 1, we establish logarithmic growth.\n  For the case \\beta > 1, we establish a connection with a class of\ninhomogeneous random graphs known as the Chung-Lu model.

Many\nhashing algorithms found their theoretic root in random projection. Since these\nalgorithms generate the hash tables (projections) randomly, a large number of\nhash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required in order to achieve both high\nprecision and recall.

(b-bit) Minwise hashing requires an expensive preprocessing step that\ncomputes k (e.g., 500) minimal values after applying the corresponding\npermutations for each data vector. We developed a parallelization scheme using\nGPUs and observed that the preprocessing time can be reduced by a factor of\n20-80 and becomes substantially smaller than the data loading time.\n  2. One major advantage of b-bit minwise hashing is that it can substantially\nreduce the amount of memory required for batch learning. However, as online\nalgorithms become increasingly popular for large-scale learning in the context\nof search, it is not clear if b-bit minwise yields significant improvements for\nthem. This paper demonstrates that $b$-bit minwise hashing provides an\neffective data size/dimension reduction scheme and hence it can dramatically\nreduce the data loading time for each epoch of the online training process.\nThis is significant because online learning often requires many (e.g., 10 to\n100) epochs to reach a sufficient accuracy.\n  3. Another critical issue is that for very large data sets it becomes\nimpossible to store a (fully) random permutation matrix, due to its space\nrequirements. Our paper is the first study to demonstrate that $b$-bit minwise\nhashing implemented using simple hash functions, e.g., the 2-universal (2U) and\n4-universal (4U) hash families, can produce very similar learning results as\nusing fully random permutations.

Thus, the holographic\n$\\Lambda(t)$CDM model is just a time-varying vacuum energy scenario in which\nthe interaction between vacuum and dark matter changes sign during the\nexpansion of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 09:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2012 15:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 13:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

We assume constant $\\alpha$\nviscosity and use a cooling function with realistic opacity. Then, we derive\nthe critical surface density $\\Sigma_{\\rm{c}}$ that is necessary for a disk to\nbecome gravitationally unstable as a function of $r$. This critical surface\ndensity $\\Sigma_{\\rm c}$ is strongly affected by the temperature dependence of\nthe opacity. At the radius $r_{\\rm c}\\sim 20$AU, where ices form, the value of\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm c}$ changes discontinuously by one order of magnitude. This\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm c}$ is determined only by local thermal process and criterion of\ngravitational instability. By comparing a given surface density profile to\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm c}$, one can discuss the gravitational instability of\nprotoplanetary disks. As an example, we discuss the gravitational instability\nof two semi-analytic models for protoplanetary disks. One is the steady state\naccretion disk, which is realized after the viscous evolution. The other is the\ndisk that has the same angular momentum distribution with its parent cloud\ncore, which corresponds to the disk that has just formed. As a result, it is\nfound that the disks tend to become gravitationally unstable for $r\\ge r_{\\rm\nc}$ because ices enable the disks to become low temperature. In the region\ncloser to the protostar than $r_{\\rm c}$, it is difficult for a typical\nprotoplanetary disk to fragment because of the high temperature and the large\nCoriolis force. From this result, we conclude that the fragmentation near the\ncentral star is possible but difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 13:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

The\napproximately 10-Earth-mass solid core responsible for the attraction of the\ngaseous envelope has to form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc\nis completed within 1-10 million years. Building up the core by collisions\nbetween km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this time-scale constraint,\nespecially at wide stellar separations. Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are\ndetected by direct imaging at wide orbital distances. In this paper, we\nnumerically study the growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles\nloosely coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed masses\nranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown 10-Earth-mass core and test\ndifferent particle sizes. The numerical results are in good agreement with our\nanalytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one\nset by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and\nthe other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere.\nIn the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass,\nwhile in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass.\nWe discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant\ncores. We conclude that pebble accretion can resolve the long-standing core\naccretion time-scale conflict. This requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in\nthe midplane, particle growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive\nplanetesimals or low radial pressure support. The core growth time-scale is\nshortened by a factor 30-1,000 at 5 AU and by a factor 100-10,000 at 50 AU,\ncompared to the gravitationally focused accretion of, respectively,\nlow-scale-height planetesimal fragments or standard km-sized planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 14:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 09:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The rate of time dependence in resistivity\nis much higher than that of magnetization and it exhibits a different cooling\nfield dependence due to percolation effects. Our analysis show that the time\ndependence in physical properties depends on the phase transition dynamics\nwhich can be effectively tuned by variation of temperature, cooling field and\nmetastable phase fraction. The phase transition dynamics can be broadly divided\ninto the arrested and un-arrested regimes, and in the arrested regime, this\ndynamics is mainly determined by time taken in the growth of critical nuclei.\nAn increase in cooling field and/or temperature shifts this dynamics from\narrested to un-arrested regime, and in this regime, this dynamics is determined\nby thermodynamically allowed rate of formation of critical nuclei which in turn\ndepends on the cooling field and available metastable phase fraction. At a\ngiven temperature, a decrease in metastable phase fraction shifts the crossover\nfrom arrested to un-arrested regimes towards lower cooling field. It is rather\nsignificant that inspite of the metastable phase fraction calculated from\nresistivity being somewhat off from that of magnetization, their cooling field\ndependence exhibits a striking similarity which indicate that the dynamics in\narrested and un-arrested regimes are so different that it comes out vividly\nprovided that the measurements are done around percolation threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 14:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The high-frequency trader has the choice to trade via market\norders or limit orders, which are represented respectively by impulse controls\nand regular controls. We model and discuss the consequences of the two main\nfeatures of this particular microstructure: first, the limit orders sent by the\nhigh frequency trader are only partially executed, and therefore she has no\ncontrol on the executed quantity. For this purpose, cumulative executed volumes\nare modelled by compound Poisson processes. Second, the high frequency trader\nfaces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of brutal variations in her\ninventory. The consequences of this risk are investigated in the context of\noptimal liquidation. The optimal trading problem is studied by stochastic\ncontrol and dynamic programming methods, which lead to a characterization of\nthe value function in terms of an integro quasi-variational inequality. We then\nprovide the associated numerical resolution procedure, and convergence of this\ncomputational scheme is proved. Next, we examine several situations where we\ncan on one hand simplify the numerical procedure by reducing the number of\nstate variables, and on the other hand focus on specific cases of practical\ninterest. We examine both a market making problem and a best execution problem\nin the case where the mid-price process is a martingale.
