The discovery of about 700 extrasolar planets, so far, has lead to\nthe first statistics concerning extrasolar planets. The presence of giant\nplanets seems to depend on stellar metallicity and mass. For example, they are\nmore frequent around metal-rich stars,with an exponential increase in planet\noccurrence rates with metallicity.\n  Aims. We analyzed two samples of metal-poor stars (-2.0 \\leq [Fe/H] \\leq 0.0)\nto see if giant planets are indeed rare around these objects. Radial velocity\ndatasets were obtained with two different spectrographs (HARPS and HIRES).\nDetection limits for these data,expressed in minimum planetary mass and period,\nare calculated. These produce trustworthy numbers for the planet frequency.\n  Methods. A general Lomb Scargle (GLS) periodogram analysis was used together\nwith a bootstrapping method to produce the detection limits. Planet frequencies\nwere calculated based on a binomial distribution function within metallicity\nbins.\n  Results. Almost all hot Jupiters and most giant planets should have been\nfound in these data. Hot Jupiters around metal-poor stars have a frequency\nlower than 1.0% at one sigma. Giant planets with periods up to 1800 days,\nhowever, have a higher frequency of $f_p = 2.63^{+2.5}_{-0.8}%$. Taking into\naccount the different metallicities of the stars, we show that giant planets\nappear to be very frequent $(f_p = 4.48^{+4.04}_{-1.38}%)$ around stars with\n[Fe/H] > -0.7, while they are rare around stars with [Fe/H] \\leq -0.7 (\\leq\n2.36% at one sigma).\n  Conclusions. Giant planet frequency is indeed a strong function of\nmetallicity, even in the low-metallicity tail. However, the frequencies are\nmost likely higher than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 16:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Abstract\ninterpretation is currently one of the best approaches to discover useful\ninvariants, especially numerical ones. However, its application is limited by\ntwo orthogonal issues: (i) developing an abstract interpretation is often\nnon-trivial; each transfer function of the system has to be represented at the\nabstract level, depending on the abstract domain used; (ii) with precise but\ncostly abstract domains, the information computed by the abstract interpreter\ncan be used only once a post fix point has been reached; something that may\ntake a long time for very large system analysis or with delayed widening to\nimprove precision.\n  This paper proposes a new, completely automatic, method to build abstract\ninterpreters.

For example, the amplitude for entering a spatial region during a\ngiven time interval is typically defined by summing over all paths between\ngiven initial and final points but restricting them to pass through the region\nat any time. We argue that there is, however, under very general conditions, a\nsignificant complication in such constructions. This is the fact that the\nconcrete implementation of the restrictions on paths over an interval of time\ncorresponds, in an operator language, to sharp monitoring at every moment of\ntime in the given time interval. Such processes suffer from the quantum Zeno\neffect - the continual monitoring of a quantum system in a Hilbert subspace\nprevents its state from leaving that subspace. As a consequence, path integral\namplitudes defined in this seemingly obvious way have physically and\nintuitively unreasonable properties and in particular, no sensible classical\nlimit. In this paper we describe this frequently-occurring but\nlittle-appreciated phenomenon in some detail, showing clearly the connection\nwith the quantum Zeno effect. We then show that it may be avoided by\nimplementing the restriction on paths in the path integral in a \"softer\" way.\nThe resulting amplitudes then involve a new coarse graining parameter, which\nmay be taken to be a timescale \\epsilon, describing the softening of the\nrestrictions on the paths. We argue that the complications arising from the\nZeno effect are then negligible as long as \\epsilon >> 1/ E, where E is the\nenergy scale of the incoming state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 19:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 21:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 16:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Based on the well-defined TOUGH sample of 69\nX-ray selected Swift GRBs, we have targeted the hosts of a subsample of 20 GRBs\nknown from afterglow spectroscopy to be in the redshift range 1.8-4.5. We\ndetect Lya emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting\n3sigma line flux being 8E-18 erg/cm2/s, corresponding to a Lya luminosity of\n6E41 erg/s at z=3. The Lya luminosities for the 7 hosts in which we detect Lya\nemission are in the range (0.6-2.3)E42 erg/s corresponding to star-formation\nrates of 0.6-2.1 Msun/yr (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Lya\nequivalent widths (EWs) for the 7 hosts are in the range 9-40A. For 6 of the 13\nhosts for which Lya is not detected we place fairly strong 3sigma upper limits\non the EW (<20A), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less\nconstraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Lya EWs is\ninconsistent with being drawn from the Lya EW distribution of bright Lyman\nbreak galaxies at the 98.3% level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average\nhave larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on\na smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are\nLya emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the\npre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92%\nlevel. The velocity centroid of the Lya line is redshifted by 200-700 km/s with\nrespect to the systemic velocity, similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly\nindicating star-formation driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems\nto be a trend between the Lya EW and the optical to X-ray spectral index of the\nafterglow (beta_OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength\nand even presence of Lya emission.

Transport to Earth through the\ninterstellar medium is expected to affect the cosmic ray properties as well.\nHowever, the observed anisotropy of TeV cosmic rays and its energy dependence\ncannot be explained with diffusion models of particle propagation in the\nGalaxy. Within a distance of a few parsec, diffusion regime is not valid and\nparticles with energy below about 100 TeV must be influenced by the heliosphere\nand its elongated tail. The observation of a highly significant localized\nexcess region of cosmic rays from the apparent direction of the downstream\ninterstellar flow at 1-10 TeV energies might provide the first experimental\nevidence that the heliotail can affect the transport of energetic particles. In\nparticular, TeV cosmic rays propagating through the heliotail interact with the\n100-300 AU wide magnetic field polarity domains generated by the 11 year\ncycles. Since the strength of non-linear convective processes is expected to be\nlarger than viscous damping, the plasma in the heliotail is turbulent. Where\nmagnetic field domains converge on each other due to solar wind gradient,\nstochastic magnetic reconnection likely occurs. Such processes may be efficient\nenough to re-accelerate a fraction of TeV particles as long as scattering\nprocesses are not strong. Therefore the fractional excess of TeV cosmic rays\nfrom the narrow region toward the heliotail direction traces sightlines with\nthe lowest smearing scattering effects, that can also explain the observation\nof a harder than average energy spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\ncurvature of the arc suggests that the lensing mass is nearly coincident with\nthe brightest cluster galaxy, and the color is consistent with the arc being a\nstar-forming galaxy. We compare the constraint on M200 based upon strong\nlensing with Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich results, finding that the two are consistent if\nthe redshift of the arc is z > 3.

We model the reverberation mapping data\ndirectly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the BLR, as well as\nderiving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizing\nfactor or virial coefficient. We find that the geometry of the BLR in Mrk 50 is\na nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6(+1.2,-0.9) light days, a\nwidth of the BLR of 6.9(+1.2,-1.1) light days, and a disk opening angle of\n25\\pm10 degrees above the plane. We also constrain the inclination angle to be\n9(+7,-5) degrees, close to face-on. Finally, the black hole mass of Mrk 50 is\ninferred to be log10(M(BH)/Msun) = 7.57(+0.44,-0.27). By comparison to the\nvirial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mapping\nanalysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10(f)\n= 0.78(+0.44,-0.27), consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74\nbased on aligning the M(BH)-{\\sigma}* relation for AGN and quiescent galaxies.\nWhile our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflow\nin the BLR, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 20:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This\ncommences with the type Ia (SNIa) showing the weakest association, followed by\nthe SNII, then the SNIb, with the SNIc showing the strongest correlation to SF\nregions. Thus our progenitor mass sequence runs Ia-II-Ib-Ic. 2) Overall SNIbc\nare found to occur nearer to bright HII regions than SNII. This implies that\nthe former have shorter stellar lifetimes thus arising from more massive\nprogenitor stars. 3) While SNIIP do not closely follow the on-going SF, they\naccurately trace the recent formation. This implies that their progenitors\narise from stars at the low end of the CC SN mass sequence, consistent with\ndirect detections of progenitors in pre-explosion imaging. 4) Similarly SNIIn\ntrace recent but not the on-going SF. This implies that, contrary to the\ngeneral consensus, the majority of these SNe do not arise from the most massive\nstars. Results and constraints are also presented for the less numerous SNIIL,\nIIb, and 'impostors'. Finally we present analysis of possible biases in the\ndata, the results of which argue strongly against any selection effects that\ncould explain the relative excess of SNIbc within bright HII regions.

This raises the\npossibility that even fundamental theories with a negative cosmological\nconstant can be consistent with our low-energy observations of a classical,\naccelerating universe.

The\nimplications of these results for model building in string cosmology are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 20:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 05:26:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 08:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-01"}

We inspected the group properties of the\nPN spectra and classified them based on the different dust classes\n(featureless, carbon-rich dust; oxygen-rich dust; mixed-chemistry dust) and\nsubclasses (aromatic and aliphatic; crystalline and amorphous). All PNe are\ncharacterized by dust continuum and more than 80% of the sample shows solid\nstate features above the continuum, in contrast with the Magellanic Cloud\nsample where only ~40% of the entire sample displays solid state features; this\nis an indication of the strong link between dust properties and metallicity.\nThe Galactic PNe that show solid state features are almost equally divided\namong the CRD, ORD, and MCD. We analyzed dust properties together with other PN\nproperties and found that (i) there is an enhancement of MCD PNe toward the\nGalactic center; (ii) CRD PNe could be seen as defining an evolutionary\nsequence, contrary to the ORD and MCD PNe; (iii) C- and O-rich grains retain\ndifferent equilibrium temperatures, as expected from models; (iv) ORD PNe are\nhighly asymmetric and CRD PNe highly symmetric; point-symmetry is statistically\nmore common in MCD. We find that the Galactic Disk sample does not include MCD\nPNe, and the other dust classes are differently populated from high to low\nmetallicity environments. The MCPNe seem to attain higher dust temperatures at\nsimilar evolutionary stages, in agreement with the observational findings of\nsmaller dust grains in low metallicity interstellar environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 23:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The traditional view of a classical\nunique spacetime near a black hole horizon conflicts with this picture. The\nquestion then arises as to what spacetime does the probe actually see as it\ncrosses a horizon, and how does the background geometry imprint its signature\nonto the thermal properties of the probe. In this work, we explore these\nquestions through an extensive series of numerical simulations of D0 branes. We\ndetermine that the D0 branes quickly settle into an incompressible symmetric\nstate -- thermalized within a few oscillations through a process driven\nentirely by internal non-linear dynamics. Surprisingly, thermal background\nfluctuations play no role in this mechanism. Signatures of the background\nfields in this thermal state arise either through fluxes, i.e. black hole hair;\nor if the probe expands to the size of the horizon -- which we see evidence of.\nWe determine simple scaling relations for the D0 branes' equilibrium size, time\nto thermalize, lifetime, and temperature in terms of their number, initial\nenergy, and the background fields.

The liquid film has first a constant\nthickness and then undergoes the Rayleigh-Plateau instability which leads to\nthe formation of sequences of drops, separated by a thin film, moving down at a\nconstant velocity. Different polymer solutions are used, i.e. xanthan solutions\nand polyacrylamide (PAAm) solutions. These solutions both exhibit shear-rate\ndependence of the viscosity, but for PAAm solutions, there are strong normal\nstresses in addition of the shear-thinning effect. We characterize\nexperimentally and separately the effects of these two non-Newtonian properties\non the flow on the fiber. Thus, in the flat film observed before the emergence\nof the drops, only shear-thinning effect plays a role and tends to thin the\nfilm compared to the Newtonian case. The effect of the non-Newtonian rheology\non the Rayleigh-Plateau instability is then investigated through the\nmeasurements of the growth rate and the wavelength of the instability. Results\nare in good agreement with linear stability analysis for a shear-thinning\nfluid. The effect of normal stress can be taken into account by considering an\neffective surface tension which tends to decrease the growth rate of the\ninstability. Finally, the dependence of the morphology of the drops with the\nnormal stress is investigated and a simplified model including the normal\nstress within the lubrication approximation provides good quantitative results\non the shape of the drops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 08:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 13:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-21"}

As a first\nstep towards answering these questions, we have searched for Ly\\alpha\\\nenvelopes around six radio-quiet quasars at z~4.5, using deep spectra taken\nwith the FORS2 spectrograph attached to the UT1 of the Very Large Telescope\n(VLT). Using the multi-slit mode allows us to observe several point spread\nfunction stars simultaneously with the quasar, and to remove the point-like\nemission from the quasar, unveiling the faint underlying Ly\\alpha\\ envelope\nwith unprecedented depth. An envelope is detected around four of the six\nquasars, which suggests that these envelopes are very frequent. Their diameter\nvaries in the range 26<d<64 kpc, their surface brightness in the range\n3x10^{-19}<\\mu<2x10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, and their luminosity in the\nrange 10^{42}<L(Ly\\alpha)<10^{44} erg/s.

This paper follows a\ndifferent direction in which double negation does hold. The algebraic notions\nof effect algebra/module that emerged in theoretical physics form the\ncornerstone. It is shown that under mild conditions on a category, its maps of\nthe form X -> 1+1 carry such effect module structure, and can be used as\npredicates. Predicates are identified in many different situations, and capture\nfor instance ordinary subsets, fuzzy predicates in a probabilistic setting,\nidempotents in a ring, and effects (positive elements below the unit) in a\nC*-algebra or Hilbert space. In quantum foundations the duality between states\nand effects plays an important role. It appears here in the form of an\nadjunction, where we use maps 1 -> X as states. For such a state s and a\npredicate p, the validity probability s |= p is defined, as an abstract Born\nrule. It captures many forms of (Boolean or probabilistic) validity known from\nthe literature. Measurement from quantum mechanics is formalised categorically\nin terms of `instruments', using L\\\"uders rule in the quantum case.

Methods. We used sky\nreconstruction algorithms especially developed for the high quality imaging of\nINTEGRAL/IBIS data. Results. We present sky images, sensitivity maps, and\ncatalogs of detected sources in the three energy bands 17-60, 17-35, and 35-80\nkeV in the Galactic plane at |b|<17.5 deg. The total number of sources in the\nreference 17-60 keV band includes 402 objects exceeding a 4.7 sigma detection\nthreshold on the nine-year time-averaged map.

Most properties\nfollow from the description of a classical massless charge circulating with\nv\\,=\\,c. The magnetic moment of the electron yields the radius of this\ncirculation and the generated synchrotron radiation removes the singularity of\nthe Coulomb field and generates the mass of the electron. Quantum mechanics\nyields its size and the angular moment. The fine structure constant $\\alpha$\ncompares this dynamic structure of the electron with the classical point-like\nstatic view. This configuration is not stable. It will decay by the emission of\nsynchrotron radiation.\n  The stability of this description is therefor investigated by extending this\nmodel to 3 dimensions. The field lines within the free electromagnetic fields\nof the creation process, solved in polar coordinates, yield possible tracks for\na massless charge. Many possible circulating tracks are found but only a\ncombination of background fields yield environments in which stable tracks for\n$\\beta =1$ - charges may be created.\n  Knotted toroidal tracks yield the stability. A knotted field line e.g. with\nT(3,2)-symmetry may describe a spin-1/3-particle and a field line with\nT(2,3)-symmetry in form of a knotted trefoil may belong to an electron as a\nstable spin-1/2-particle.\n  With its fixed internal revolution frequency this electron appears to the\nexternal world as a standing wave with an amplitude propagating like the de\nBroglie wave.\n  Keywords: - Electron - Classical wave model - Spherical wave field -\nElementary charge - Mass - Knotted structure - Wave character\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 12:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 08:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2013 15:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2013 17:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2014 17:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 14:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 11:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 12:25:23 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Sat, 17 May 2014 09:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 14:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 08:35:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 08:41:32 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 17:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v21","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 13:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v22","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2016 08:14:32 GMT"},{"version":"v23","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 13:07:57 GMT"},{"version":"v24","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 10:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v25","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 13:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v26","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 14:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v27","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2017 10:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v28","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 10:08:05 GMT"},{"version":"v29","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 14:22:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2013 17:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v30","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 14:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v31","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 09:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v32","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 14:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v33","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 13:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v34","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 14:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v35","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 10:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v36","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 07:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:55:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2013 09:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 14:49:51 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 13:16:00 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2013 09:09:23 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2013 13:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}
