Stellar and wind parameters are determined by line profile fitting of\nH/He/N lines, exploiting the helium and nitrogen ionization balance.\nCorresponding synthetic spectra are calculated using the NLTE atmospheric code\nFASTWIND. Though there is a monotonic relationship between the emission line\nratio and Teff, all other parameters being equal, theoretical predictions\nindicate additional dependencies, most notably, on the nitrogen abundance.\nThese basic predictions are confirmed by results from atmospheric code CMFGEN.\nThe effective temperatures for the earliest O-stars, inferred from the nitrogen\nionization balance, are partly considerably hotter than indicated by previous\nstudies. Consistent with earlier results, effective temperatures increase from\nsupergiants to dwarfs for all spectral types in the LMC. The relation between\nobserved NIV4058/NIII4640 emission line ratio and Teff, for a given luminosity\nclass, turned out to be quite monotonic for our sample stars, and fairly\nconsistent with our model predictions.

For a broad class of collision rates, this system reaches a\nnon-equilibrium stationary state at large times and the cluster size\ndistribution tends to a universal form characterised by a constant flux of mass\nthrough the space of cluster sizes. Universality, in this context, means that\nthe stationary state becomes independent of the cut-off as the cut-off grows.\nThis universality is lost, however, if the aggregation rate between large and\nsmall clusters increases sufficiently steeply as a function of cluster sizes.\nWe identify a transition to a regime in which the stationary state vanishes as\nthe cut-off grows. This non-universal stationary state becomes unstable,\nhowever, as the cut-off is increased and undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. After\nthis bifurcation, the stationary kinetics are replaced by persistent and\nperiodic collective oscillations. These oscillations carry pulses of mass\nthrough the space of cluster sizes. As a result, the average mass flux remains\nconstant. Furthermore, universality is partially restored in the sense that the\nscaling of the period and amplitude of oscillation is inherited from the\ndynamical scaling exponents of the universal regime.

After tracing the historic\ndevelopment of radiance and its shortcomings, we provide a modern formulation\nof light intensity measurements that models radiance as a differential form. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this use of exterior calculus for questions in light\ntransport theory by rigorously deriving the cosine term and the area\nformulation, without the need for postulates or heuristic arguments. The\nformulation of radiance as a differential form introduced in this paper hence\nprovides the first step towards a modern theory of light transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2012 19:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-22"}

The instability is important for transporting and mixing\nheat, as well as for influencing large-scale variability on the planets. Both\nlinear normal mode analysis and non-linear initial value calculations are\ncarried out -- focusing on the freely-evolving, adiabatic situation. Using a\nhigh-resolution general circulation model (GCM) which solves the traditional\nprimitive equations, we show that large-scale jets similar to those observed in\ncurrent GCM simulations of hot extrasolar giant planets are likely to be\nbaroclinically unstable on a timescale of few to few tens of planetary\nrotations, generating cyclones and anticyclones that drive weather systems. The\ngrowth rate and scale of the most unstable mode obtained in the linear analysis\nare in qualitative, good agreement with the full non-linear calculations. In\ngeneral, unstable jets evolve differently depending on their signs (eastward or\nwestward), due to the change in sign of the jet curvature. For jets located at\nor near the equator, instability is strong at the flanks -- but not at the\ncore. Crucially, the instability is either poorly or not at all captured in\nsimulations with low resolution and/or high artificial viscosity. Hence, the\ninstability has not been observed or emphasized in past circulation studies of\nhot extrasolar planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2012 20:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Large part of interesting electroweak processes include production of\nneutrinos, while many new physics scenarios predict the existence of similarly\nweakly-interacting particles. In events with associated production of invisible\nparticles and hadronic jets, the measurement of the imbalance in transverse\nmomentum of the final state particles is the major leverage to reject the\notherwise dominant source of backgrounds in hadron colliders, i.e. the generic\nproduction of many jets by QCD interactions. Here we discuss a novel technique\nwhich utilizes the information derived from the spectrometer, eventually\ncoupled with the more straightforward calorimeter information, to infer the\npassage of invisible particles. We check the validity of this technique in data\nand Monte Carlo simulations in a broad range of topologies, starting from the\nsimplest, with two jets in the final state, to the ones with very large jet\nmultiplicities. We also suggest a new way, based on the same approach, to\nmeasure the yields and model the kinematics of the QCD multijet background in\ninvisible particles plus jets signatures.

In many applications, events constituting the data sequence arrive\nas a stream, at furious rates, and recent trends (or frequent episodes) can\nchange and drift due to the dynamical nature of the underlying event generation\nprocess. The ability to detect and track such the changing sets of frequent\nepisodes can be valuable in many application scenarios. Current methods for\nfrequent episode discovery are typically multipass algorithms, making them\nunsuitable in the streaming context. In this paper, we propose a new streaming\nalgorithm for discovering frequent episodes over a window of recent events in\nthe stream. Our algorithm processes events as they arrive, one batch at a time,\nwhile discovering the top frequent episodes over a window consisting of several\nbatches in the immediate past. We derive approximation guarantees for our\nalgorithm under the condition that frequent episodes are approximately\nwell-separated from infrequent ones in every batch of the window. We present\nextensive experimental evaluations of our algorithm on both real and synthetic\ndata.

For these purposes, we consider\ntwo characteristic compounds: YMnO3 and LuMnO3, which form different magnetic\nstructures in the ground state. First, we establish an electronic low-energy\nmodel, which describes the behavior of the Mn 3d bands of YMnO3 and LuMnO3, and\nderive parameters of this model from the first-principles calculations. From\nthe solution of this model, we conclude that, despite strong frustration\neffects in the hexagonal lattice, the relativistic spin-orbit interactions lift\nthe degeneracy of the magnetic ground state so that the experimentally observed\nmagnetic structures are successfully reproduced by the low-energy model. Then,\nwe analyze this result in terms of interatomic magnetic interactions, which\nwere computed using different approximations (starting from the model\nHamiltonian as well as directly from the first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations in the local-spin-density approximation). We argue that the main\nreason why YMnO3 and LuMnO3 tend to form different magnetic structures is\nrelated to the behavior of the single-ion anisotropy, which reflects the\ndirectional dependence of the lattice distortion: namely, the expansion and\ncontraction of the Mn-trimers, which take place in YMnO3 and LuMnO3,\nrespectively. On the other hand, the magnetic coupling between the haxagonal\nplanes is controlled by the next-nearest-neighbor interactions, which are less\nsensitive to the direction of the trimerization. Finally, using the Berry-phase\nformalism, we evaluate the magnetic-state dependence of the ferroelectric\npolarization, and discuss potential applications of the latter in\nmagnetoelectric switching phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 02:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-10"}

Both Co and\nNi suppress Tc and drive the system into the normal state. Interestingly, Ni\nsuppresses the superconductivity much faster than the Co. This indicates less\neffect on in-plane Fe-Se distances and thus reduced disorder in case of Co when\ncompared with Ni substation at Fe site in FeTe0.5Se0.5 superconductor. It is\nconcluded that in-plane disorder on superconducting Fe-Se and Fe-Se-Se planes\ndirectly affects superconductivity in FeTe0.5Se0.5 superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 04:38:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 05:58:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 08:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-21"}

The\nqualitative and quantitative results obtained for these two watermarking\nalgorithms with several benchmark images indicate that high-quality watermarked\nimages are produced by the algorithms.

A balanced mixer is a unique tool to separate\nnoise at the mixer's LO port from other noise sources. This is not possible in\nsingle-ended mixers. The antisymmetric IV characteristic of a SIS mixer further\nhelps to simplify the measurements. The double-sideband receiver sensitivity of\nthe balanced mixer is 2-4 times the quantum noise limit $h\\nu/k_B$ over the\nmeasured frequencies with a maximum LO noise rejection of 15 dB. This work\npresents independent measurements with three different LO sources that produce\nthe reference frequency but also an amount of near-carrier noise power which is\nquantified in the experiment as a function of the LO and IF frequency in terms\nof an equivalent noise temperature $T_{LO}$. In a second experiment we use only\none of two SIS mixers of the balanced mixer chip, in order to verify the\ninfluence of near-carrier LO noise power on a single-ended heterodyne mixer\nmeasurement. We find an IF frequency dependence of near-carrier LO noise power.\nThe frequency-resolved IF noise temperature slope is flat or slightly negative\nfor the single-ended mixer. This is in contrast to the IF slope of the balanced\nmixer itself which is positive due to the expected IF roll-off of the mixer.\nThis indicates a higher noise level closer to the LO's carrier frequency. Our\nfindings imply that near-carrier LO noise has the largest impact on the\nsensitivity of a receiver system which uses mixers with a low IF band, for\nexample superconducting hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 06:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 06:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-09"}

The possibility of the universal\nnature of the stellar IMF leads us to the interesting prospect of a universal\nmode of star-formation. It is well-known that turbulent fragmentation of gas in\nthe interstellar medium produces a lognormal distribution of density which is\nfurther reflected by the mass-function for clumps at low and intermediate\nmasses. Stars condense out of unstable clumps through a complex interplay\nbetween a number of dynamic processes which must be accounted for when tracing\nthe origin of the stellar IMF. In the present work, applying the theory of\ngravitational fragmentation we first derive the mass function (MF) for clumps.\nThen a core mass function (CMF) is derived by allowing the clumps to fragment,\nhaving subjected each one to a random choice of gas temperature. Finally, the\nstellar IMF is derived by applying a random core-to-star conversion efficiency,\n$\\epsilon$, in the range of 5%-15% to each CMF. We obtain a power-law IMF that\nhas exponents within the error-bars on the Kropua IMF. This derived IMF is\npreceded by a similar core mass function which suggests, gravoturbulent\nfragmentation plays a key role in assembling necessary conditions that relate\nthe two mass-functions. In this sense the star-formation process, at least at\nlow redshifts where gas cooling is efficient, is likely to be universal. We\nargue that the observed knee in the CMF and the stellar IMF may alternatively\nbe interpreted in terms of the characteristic temperature at which gas in\npotential star-forming clouds is likely to be found. Our results also show that\nturbulence in star-forming clouds is probably driven on large spatial scales\nwith a power-spectrum steeper than Kolmogorov-type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 06:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 08:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Kac in his study of\nmean-field limit for systems of $N$ undistinguishable particles. First, we\nquantitatively liken three usual measures of Kac's chaos, some involving the\nall $N$ variables, other involving a finite fixed number of variables. Next, we\ndefine the notion of entropy chaos and Fisher information chaos in a similar\nway as defined by Carlen et al (KRM 2010). We show that Fisher information\nchaos is stronger than entropy chaos, which in turn is stronger than Kac's\nchaos. More importantly, with the help of the HWI inequality of Otto-Villani,\nwe establish a quantitative estimate between these quantities, which in\nparticular asserts that Kac's chaos plus Fisher information bound implies\nentropy chaos. We then extend the above quantitative and qualitative results\nabout chaos in the framework of probability measures with support on the Kac's\nspheres. Additionally to the above mentioned tool, we use and prove an optimal\nrate local CLT in $L^\\infty$ norm for distributions with finite 6-th moment and\nfinite $L^p$ norm, for some $p>1$.

By using a rigorous variational upper bound to the free energy we are\nled to the evaluation of a partition function that can be computed\nstochastically by sampling electronic wave functions and atomic positions\n(assumed classical). In order to achieve this target we show that it is\nextremely important to consider the non trivial geometry of the space defined\nby the wave function ansatz. The method can be extended to any technique\ncapable to provide an energy value over a given wave function ansatz depending\non several variational parameters and atomic positions. In particular we can\ntake into account electronic correlation, by using the standard variational\nquantum Monte Carlo method, that has been so far limited to zero temperature\nground state properties. We show that our approximation reduces correctly to\nthe standard Born-Oppenheimer (BO) one at zero temperature and to the correct\nhigh temperature limit. At large enough temperatures this method allows to\nimprove the BO, providing lower values of the electronic free energy, because\nwithin this method it is possible to take into account the electron entropy. We\ntest this new method on the simple hydrogen molecule, where at low temperature\nwe recover the correct BO low temperature limit. Moreover, we show that the\ndissociation of the molecule is possible at a temperature much smaller than the\nBO prediction. Several extension of the proposed technique are also discussed,\nas for instance the calculation of critical (magnetic, superconducting)\ntemperatures, or transition rates in chemical reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 09:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}

This paper reviews the orthodox, or Dirac-von Neumann\ninterpretation, and makes explicit that Hilbert space describes propositions\nabout measurement results. Kets are defined as conditional clauses referring to\nmeasurements in a formal language. It is seen that these clauses are elements\nof a Hilbert space, such that addition is logical disjunction, the dual space\nconsists of consequent clauses, and the inner product is a set of statements in\nthe subjunctive mood. The probability interpretation gives truth values for\ncorresponding future tense statements when the initial state is actually\nprepared and the final state is to be measured. The mathematical structure of\nquantum mechanics is formulated in terms of discrete measurement results at\nfinite level of accuracy and does not depend on an assumption of a substantive,\nor background, space-time continuum. A continuum of kets, |x> for x in R^3, is\nconstructed from linear combinations of kets in a finite basis. The inner\nproduct can be expressed either as a finite sum or as an integral. Discrete\nposition functions are uniquely embedded into smooth wave functions in such a\nway that differential operators are defined. It is shown that the choice of\nbasis has no effect on underlying physics (quantum covariance). The Dirac delta\nhas a representation as a smooth function. Operators do not in general have an\nintegral form. The Schroedinger equation is shown from the requirements of the\nprobability interpretation. It is remarked that a formal construction of qed\navoiding divergence problems has been completed using finite dimensional\nHilbert space.

Observed differences in\ntemperatures, outflow speeds, and velocity distribution anisotropies are useful\nconstraints on proposed explanations for how the plasma is heated and\naccelerated. This paper presents new predictions of the rates of collisionless\nheating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come\nfrom magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical\ndescription of the radial evolution of Alfven, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD\nwaves. This model provides the total wave power in each mode as a function of\ndistance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind. Next we\nsolved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady\nwavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling\nbetween the Alfven and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable\nchoices of the parameters, our model contains enough energy transfer from the\nfast mode to the Alfven mode to excite the high-frequency ion cyclotron\nresonance. This resonance is efficient at heating protons and other ions in the\ndirection perpendicular to the background magnetic field, and our model\npredicts heating rates for these species that agree well with both\nspectroscopic and in situ measurements. Nonetheless, the high-frequency waves\ncomprise only a small part of the total Alfvenic fluctuation spectrum, which\nremains highly two-dimensional as is observed in interplanetary space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 14:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

I first present the role of inelastic and\ntransfer channel couplings in fusion reactions induced by stable heavy ions.\nAnalysis of experimental fusion cross sections by using standard\ncoupled-channel calculations is discussed. The role of multi-neutron transfer\nis investigated in the fusion process below the Coulomb barrier by analyzing\n$^{32}$S+$^{90,96}$Zr as benchmark reactions. The enhancement of fusion cross\nsections for $^{32}$S+$^{96}$Zr is well reproduced at sub-barrier energies by\nNTFus code calculations including the coupling of the neutron-transfer channels\nfollowing the Zagrebaev semi-classical model. Similar effects for\n$^{40}$Ca+$^{90}$Zr and $^{40}$Ca+$^{96}$Zr fusion excitation functions are\nfound. The breakup coupling in both the elastic scattering and in the fusion\nprocess induced by weakly bound stable projectiles is also shown to be crucial.\nIn this lecture, full coupled-channel calculations of the fusion excitation\nfunctions are performed by using the breakup coupling for the more neutron-rich\nreaction and for the more weakly bound projectiles. I clearly demonstrate that\nContinuum-Discretized Coupled-Channel calculations are capable to reproduce the\nfusion enhancement from the breakup coupling in $^{6}$Li+$^{59}$Co.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 15:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-13"}

These are changes of a domain wall (DW)\nstructure in a long magnetic stripe (oscillations between a transverse DW, a\nvortex DW, and an antivortex DW) and periodic vortex-core reversals in a\ncircular magnetic dot which are accompanied by oscillatory displacements of the\nvortex from the dot center. In nanostructures of smaller thicknesses\n(comparable to the exchange length), where nonlocal magnetostatic effects are\nvery strong because of fast spatial variation of the magnetization, similar\nphenomena have been widely studied previously. Here, the dynamics is\ninvestigated within a local approach including magnetostatic field via boundary\nconditions on solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation only. Both the\nDWs in stripes and vortex states of the dot are treated as fragments of a\ncross-tie DW. Despite similarity of the cyclic transformations of the ordering\nto the dynamics of more strongly confined nanomagnets, details of motion\n(trajectories) of the vortices and antivortices (Bloch lines) of the textures\nunder study are different, which is related to prohibition of rapid jumps of\nthe polarization of Bloch lines. In addition to the magnetization rotation\nabout the direction of magnetic field or current polarization, the evolution of\ntextures is shown to relate to oscillatory changes of the direction of a\ncross-tie DW with respect to any arbitrary axis in the magnet plane accompanied\nby oscillations of the DW width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2012 17:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-06"}

The image is encoded as a set of contractive affine\ntransformations. The image is partitioned into non-overlapping range blocks,\nand a best matching domain block larger than the range block is identified.\nThere are many attempts on improving the encoding time by reducing the size of\nsearch pool for range-domain matching. But these methods are attempting to\nprepare a static domain pool that remains unchanged throughout the encoding\nprocess. This paper proposes dynamic preparation of separate domain pool for\neach range block. This will result in significant reduction in the encoding\ntime. The domain pool for a particular range block can be selected based upon a\nparametric value. Here we use classification based on local fractal dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 May 2012 17:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}
