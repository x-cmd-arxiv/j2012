In the absence of a closed-form solution,\nmuch of the past efforts have focused on locating its critical manifold,\ntrajectory in the parameter $\\{q, e^J\\}$ space where $J$ is the reduced\ninteraction, along which the free energy is singular. However, except in\nisolated cases, antiferromagnetic (AF) models with $J<0$ have been largely\nneglected. In this paper we consider the Potts model with AF interactions\nfocusing on deducing its critical manifold in exact and/or closed-form\nexpressions.\n  We first re-examine the known critical frontiers in light of AF interactions.\nFor the square lattice we confirm the Potts self-dual point to be the sole\ncritical point for $J>0$. We also locate its critical frontier for $J<0$ and\nfind it to coincide with a solvability condition observed by Baxter in 1982.\nFor the honeycomb lattice we show that the known critical point holds for {all}\n$J$, and determine its critical $q_c = \\frac 1 2 (3+\\sqrt 5) = 2.61803$ beyond\nwhich there is no transition. For the triangular lattice we confirm the known\ncritical point to hold only for $J>0$.\n  More generally we consider the centered-triangle (CT) and Union-Jack (UJ)\nlattices consisting of mixed $J$ and $K$ interactions, and deduce critical\nmanifolds under homogeneity hypotheses. For K=0 the CT lattice is the diced\nlattice, and we determine its critical manifold for all $J$ and find $q_c =\n3.32472$. For K=0 the UJ lattice is the square lattice and from this we deduce\nboth the $J>0$ and $J<0$ critical manifolds and find $q_c=3$ for the square\nlattice.

Einstein's 1913-1914 theory, the field equations of which were not\ngenerally covariant, remained without empirical support.

We argue that a single discrete\n\\tilde{Z}^{H}_2 symmetry can be used to forbid tree-level flavor-changing\ntransitions, as well as the most dangerous baryon and lepton number violating\noperators. We present 5D and 6D orbifold GUT constructions that lead to the E_6\ninspired SUSY models of this type. The breakdown of U(1)_{\\psi} and U(1)_{\\chi}\ngauge symmetries that preserves E_6 matter parity assignment guarantees that\nordinary quarks and leptons and their superpartners, as well as the exotic\nstates which originate from 27 representations of E_6 survive to low energies.\nThese E_6 inspired models contain two dark-matter candidates and must also\ninclude additional TeV scale vectorlike lepton or vectorlike down type quark\nstates to render the lightest exotic quark unstable. We examine gauge coupling\nunification in these models and discuss their implications for collider\nphenomenology and cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 May 2012 14:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2012 03:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

In our model, each site of a lattice may be vacant or host individuals\nof species A and/or B; multiple occupancy by the same species is prohibited.\nSymbiosis is represented by a reduced death rate, mu < 1, for individuals at\nsites with both species present. Otherwise, the dynamics is that of the basic\nCP, with creation (at vacant neighbor sites) at rate lambda and death of\n(isolated) individuals at a rate of unity. Mean-field theory and Monte Carlo\nsimulation show that the critical creation rate, lambda_c (mu), is a decreasing\nfunction of mu, even though a single-species population must go extinct for\nlambda < lambda_c(1), the critical point of the basic CP. Extensive simulations\nyield results for critical behavior that are compatible with the directed\npercolation (DP) universality class, but with unusually strong corrections to\nscaling. A field-theoretical argument supports the conclusion of DP critical\nbehavior.
