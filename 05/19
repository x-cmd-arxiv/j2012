We find that the\nkinetic power of the winds scales with increasing bolometric luminosity as\nlog(L_wind) \\propto (1.58 \\pm 0.07) log(L_Bol). This means that SMBH may be\nmore efficient than stellar-mass black holes in launching winds. In addition,\nthe simplicity of the scaling may suggest common driving mechanisms across the\nmass scale.

The\ncovariance matrix can be decomposed into three pieces: a diagonal term arising\nfrom Poisson noise; a sample variance term arising from large-scale structure\nin the survey volume; an occupancy covariance term arising due to galaxies of\ndifferent luminosities inhabiting the same cluster. To evaluate the theory one\nneeds: the mass function and bias of clusters, and the conditional luminosity\nfunction (CLF).

The task is observationally challenging because we\ncannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or X-ray\nemission from hot plasma are imperfect. In this paper we quantify the\nconsequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129\nX-ray selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field with redshifts 0<z<1 and halo\nmasses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 M_sun. By measuring the stacked lensing\nsignal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest member\ngalaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the X-ray centroid), we\ndetermine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. In this\nsample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the X-ray centroids trace\nthe center of mass to <~75 kpc, while the X-ray position and centroids based on\nthe mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to the\nstatistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).\nApproximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiple\nbright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles that\nare not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.\nWe find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by\n5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is not\naddressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 21:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 04:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-30"}

Advances in science\nhave dictated Roman Catholic doctrine such as the acceptance of Darwinian\nevolution and Big Bang cosmology.

The question is whether or\nnot his work was deleterious for church doctrine or whether it was compatible\nwith, or even advanced, church dogma. It's my contention that Einstein revived\nthe relationship between science and theology and did not create a bifurcation\nbetween the two.

In modern world, cryptography hackers try\nto break a code or cryptographic algorithm or try to retrieve the key, which is\nneeded to encrypt a message, by analyzing the insertion or presence of\nrepetitive bits / characters (bytes) in the message and encrypted message to\nfind out the encryption algorithm or the key used for it. So it is must for a\ngood encryption method to exclude the repetitive terms such that no trace of\nrepetitions can be tracked down. For this reason we apply SD-AREE cryptographic\nmethod to exclude repetitive terms from a message, which is to be encrypted. In\nSD-AREE method the repetitive bits / characters are removed and there is no\ntrace of any repetition in the message.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 23:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-22"}

We determined that RCW175,\nwhich actually consists of two separate HII regions, G29.1-0.7 and G29.0-0.6,\nis located at a distance of 3.2+/-0.2 kpc. Based on the observations we infer\nthat the more compact G29.0-0.6 is less evolved than G29.1-0.7 and was possibly\nproduced as a result of the expansion of G29.1-0.7 into the surrounding\ninterstellar medium. We compute a star formation rate for RCW175 of\n(12.6+/-1.9)x10^{-5} M_{\\sun}/yr, and identified 6 possible young stellar\nobject candidates within its vicinity. Additionally, we estimate that RCW175\ncontains a total dust mass of 215+/-53 M_{\\sun}.\n  RCW175 has previously been identified as a source of anomalous microwave\nemission (AME), an excess of emission at cm wavelengths often attributed to\nelectric dipole radiation from the smallest dust grains. We find that the AME\npreviously detected in RCW175 is not correlated with the smallest dust grains\n(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or small carbonaceous dust grains), but\nrather with the exciting radiation field within the region. This is a similar\nresult to that found in the Perseus molecular cloud, another region which\nharbors AME, suggesting that the radiation field may play a pivotal role in the\nproduction of this new Galactic emission mechanism. Finally, we suggest that\nthese observations may hint at the importance of understanding the role played\nby the major gas ions in spinning dust models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 23:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Here we consider the outputs of the\ncommonly used Bruzual & Charlot and GALEV models, as well as a recently updated\nSSP model suite which attempts to include the contributions of binary merger\nproducts in the form of blue straggler stars (BS-SSP). We rederive the ages,\nmetallicities, extinction values and masses of 445 previously observed\nglobular-like clusters in M31 based on chi-square minimisation of their\nspectral energy distributions with respect to these three different SSP models\nand adopting a Chabrier-like stellar initial mass function. A comparison\nbetween our new results and previous estimates of the same parameters shows\nthat the Bruzual & Charlot models yield the youngest ages and lowest masses,\nwhile adoption of the BS-SSP models results in the oldest ages and highest mass\nestimates. Similarly, the GALEV SSP models produce the lowest metallicities,\nwith the highest values resulting from the BS-SSP model suite. These trends are\ncaused by intrinsic differences associated with the models, and are not\nsignificantly affected by the well-known age-metallicity degeneracy. Finally,\nwe note that the mass function of the massive M31 star clusters is similar to\nthat of the Milky Way's globular clusters, which implies that the two star\ncluster systems likely formed under similar environmental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2012 09:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Introduction Modern network are multi-layer by their structure. This\nrequires the development of new mathematical models, which would allow to\nadequately describe the existing physical and logical connections between the\nelements on its different levels, and to effectively solve the problems of\ndesign. The paper formulates the problem of synthesis of structure of MPLS\nnetwork layered with the transport SDH network or WDM and suggests the method\nof its solving. The solving is based on the application of mathematical model\nof multi-layer graph. II, III, IV. Main Part During the planning of MPLS\nnetworks it is necessary to determine the topology of both the networks: that\nof transport one and that of MPLS one. This means that one needs to determine:\n- what nodes of the transport network should support the MPLS functionality; -\nin what way the LSR nodes should be connected via the transport network; - what\nshould be the bandwidth between LSR links. According to the general method for\nsolving the problem of synthesis of multiservice telecommunication systems with\nthe usage of multi-layer graphs, we have to synthesize the initial redundant .\nThe solving of the task above can be reduced to the finding of the multi-layer\nminimum weight subgraph that provides the transfer of information flows with\nthe consideration of the requirements to the structure of the multilayer graph\n[5] and the flows on its edges [6] observed at the applying of constraints to\nthe bandwidth of the edges of the multi-layer graph. V. Conclusion The paper\nreduces the problem of design of multiservice telecommunication system with the\ntransferred flows to the problem of finding a multilayer minimum weight\nsubgraph with the consideration of constraints to the graph edges bandwidth. It\nis shown that application of given method provide to reduce MPLS network cost\nto 10 - 16 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 May 2012 11:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}
