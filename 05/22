The main interest is to separate its nonzero coordinates\nfrom the zero ones (i.e., variable selection). Motivated by examples in\nlong-memory time series (Fan and Yao [Nonlinear Time Series: Nonparametric and\nParametric Methods (2003) Springer]) and the change-point problem (Bhattacharya\n[In Change-Point Problems (South Hadley, MA, 1992) (1994) 28-56 IMS]), we are\nprimarily interested in the case where the Gram matrix $G=X'X$ is nonsparse but\nsparsifiable by a finite order linear filter. We focus on the regime where\nsignals are both rare and weak so that successful variable selection is very\nchallenging but is still possible. We approach this problem by a new procedure\ncalled the covariate assisted screening and estimation (CASE). CASE first uses\na linear filtering to reduce the original setting to a new regression model\nwhere the corresponding Gram (covariance) matrix is sparse. The new covariance\nmatrix induces a sparse graph, which guides us to conduct multivariate\nscreening without visiting all the submodels. By interacting with the signal\nsparsity, the graph enables us to decompose the original problem into many\nseparated small-size subproblems (if only we know where they are!). Linear\nfiltering also induces a so-called problem of information leakage, which can be\novercome by the newly introduced patching technique. Together, these give rise\nto CASE, which is a two-stage screen and clean [Fan and Song Ann. Statist. 38\n(2010) 3567-3604; Wasserman and Roeder Ann.

For some of these techniques, the\nnumber of terms in the series K plays the lead role in the computational cost\nof the calculation, and is therefore often a limiting factor in simulating open\nquantum system dynamics. We present an open source MATLAB program called\nBATHFIT 1, whose input is any spectral distribution functions J(w) or bath\nresponse function, and whose output attempts to be the set of parameters\n{p_k,w_k}_k=1^K such that for a given value of K, the series {\\Sigma}_k^k p_k\ne^{O_k t} is as close as possible to a(t). This should allow the user to\nrepresent a(t) as accurately as possible with as few parameters as possible.\nThe program executes non-linear least squares fitting, and for a very wide\nvariety of spectral distribution functions, competent starting parameters are\nused for these fits. For most forms of J(w), these starting parameters, and the\nexact a(t) corresponding to the given J(w), are calculated using the recent\nPade decomposition technique - therefore this program can also be used to\nmerely implement the Pade decomposition for these spectral distribution\nfunctions; and it can also be used just to efficiently and accurately calculate\na(t) for any given J(w) . The program also gives the J(w) corresponding to a\ngiven a(t), which may allow one to assess the quality (in the w-domain) of a\nrepresentation of a(t) being used. Finally, the program can calculate the\ndiscretized influence functional coefficients for any J(w), and this is\ncomputed very efficiently for most forms of J(w) by implementing the recent\ntechnique published in [Quantum Physics Letters (2012) 1 (1) pg. 35].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 16:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 May 2012 15:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-29"}

To\nthe difference of complex pseudoanalytic (generalized analytic) functions the\ntheory of bicomplex functions has not been developed. Such basic facts as the\nsimilarity principle or the Liouville theorem in general are no longer\navailable due to the presence of zero divisors in the algebra of bicomplex\nnumbers. We develop a theory of bicomplex pseudoanalytic formal powers\nanalogous to the developed by Bers and obtain Cauchy's integral formula in the\nbicomplex setting. In the classical complex situation this formula was obtained\nunder the assumption that the involved Cauchy kernel is global, a restrictive\ncondition taking into account possible applications, especially when the\nequation itself is not defined on the whole plane. We show that the Cauchy\nintegral formula remains valid with a Cauchy kernel from a wider class called\nhere the reproducing Cauchy kernels. We give a complete characterization of\nthis class.

We establish that reproducing Cauchy kernels can be used to obtain a\nfull set of negative formal powers for the corresponding bicomplex Vekua\nequation and present an algorithm for their construction.

We create packs\nwithout this anisotropy, and then later break the symmetry by adding a\nboundary. Our isotropic packs are very sensitive, and their responses to point\nforces diverge wildly, indicating that they cannot be described by any\ncontinuum stress model. We stabilize the packs by supplying an additional\nboundary, which makes the response much more regular. The response of the\nstabilized packs resembles what one would expect in a hyperstatic pack, despite\nthe isostatic bulk.

Uniform plasma rotation is imposed to create a centrifugal\nacceleration, which mimics the gravity required for the classical Parker\ninstability. The goal of this study is to determine how the Parker instability\ncould be unambiguously identified in a weakly magnetized, rapidly rotating\nscrew pinch, in which the rotation provides an effective gravity and a radially\nvarying azimuthal field is controlled to give conditions for which the plasma\nis magnetically buoyant to inward motion.

These conditions can be realized in the Madison Plasma\nCouette Experiment (MPCX). Simulations are performed using the extended MHD\ncode NIMROD for an isothermal compressible plasma model. Both linear and\nnonlinear regimes of the instability are studied, and the results obtained for\nthe linear regime are compared with analytical results from a slab geometry.\nBased on this comparison, it is found that in a cylindrical pinch the magnetic\nbuoyancy mechanism dominates at relatively large Mach numbers (M>5), while at\nlow Mach numbers (M<1) the instability is due to the curvature of magnetic\nfield lines. At intermediate values of Mach number (1<M<5) the Coriolis force\nhas a strong stabilizing effect on the plasma.

First, with standard star formation and supernova\nfeedback prescriptions, we find that the mean baryonic fraction value estimated\nat the virial radius of the two main central objects (i.e. the Milky Way and\nAndromeda) is decreasing over time, and is 10-15% lower than the universal\nvalue, 0.166, at z=0. This decrease is mainly due to the fact that the amount\nof accretion of dissipative gas onto the halo, especially at low redshift, is\nin general much lower than that of the dissipationless dark matter. Indeed, a\nsignificant part of the baryons does not collapse onto the haloes and remains\nin their outskirts, mainly in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).\nMoreover, during the formation of each object, some dark matter and baryons are\nalso expelled through merger events via tidal disruption. In contrast to\nbaryons, expelled dark matter can be more efficiently re-accreted onto the\nhalo, enhancing both the reduction of fb inside Rv, and the increase of the\nmass of WHIM outside Rv. Varying the efficiency of supernovae feedback at low\nredshift does not seem to significantly affect these trends. Alternatively,\nwhen a significant fraction of the initial gas in the main objects is released\nat high redshifts by more powerful sources of feedback, such as AGN from\nintermediate mass black holes in lower mass galaxies, the baryonic fraction at\nthe virial radius can have a lower value (fb~0.12) at low redshift. Hence\nphysical mechanisms able to drive the gas out of the virial radius at high\nredshifts will have a stronger impact on the deficit of baryons in the mass\nbudget of Milky Way type-galaxies at present times than those that expel the\ngas in the longer, late phases of galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 19:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 06:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The later is\nreferred to as a \"plunge\" because the compact object dives into the MBH. The\nevent rates for plunges are orders of magnitude larger than slow inspirals. On\nthe other hand, nature MBH's are most likely Kerr and the magnitude of the spin\nhas been sized up to be high.

Moreover,\nit has been recently proved that the production of low-eccentricity EMRIs is\nseverely blocked by the presence of a blockade in the rate at which orbital\nangular momenta change takes place. This is the result of relativistic\nprecession on to the stellar potential torques and hence affects EMRIs\noriginating via resonant relaxation at distances of about $\\sim 10^{-2}$ pc\nfrom the MBH.

We present new deep ATCA, Chandra and optical observations, and test\nthe feedback model. We report the first high-resolution observations of the\nradio jet. The inner jet extends ~8.5 kpc towards an optical emission-line High\nIonization Cloud (HIC) before taking a zig-zag path to an offset position. Jet\nX-ray synchrotron radiation is seen. The HIC is associated with 0.3 keV X-ray\ngas of anomalously low metallicity. On larger scales the radio galaxy displays\nall three X-ray features that together confirm supersonic expansion of the\nlobes into the external medium: gas cavities, inverse-Compton emission showing\nexcess internal lobe pressure, and high-contrast arms of temperature above the\n~1 keV ambient medium. The well-formed S lobe on the counterjet side is\nexpanding with a Mach number 2.2-3. We estimate a cavity power ~3x10^43 ergs/s,\nwhich falls well below previously reported correlations with radio power. The\ntotal inferred time-averaged jet power, ~4x10^44 ergs/s, is dominated by the\nkinetic and thermal energy of shocked gas, and if used instead would bring the\nsource into better agreement with the correlations. The S hotspot is the more\ncomplex, with a spiral polarization structure. Its bright peak emits\nsynchrotron X-rays. The fainter N hotspot is particularly interesting, with\nX-rays offset in the direction of the incoming jet by ~1 arcsec relative to the\nradio peak. Here modest (delta ~ 6) relativistic beaming and a steep radio\nspectrum cause the jet to be X-ray bright through inverse-Compton scattering\nbefore it decelerates. With such beaming, a modest proton content or small\ndeparture from minimum energy in the jet will align estimates of the\ninstantaneous and time-averaged jet power. The hotspots suggest acceleration of\nelectrons to a maximum energy ~10^13 eV in the jet termination shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 20:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

It\ncontains both a giant radio halo and a relic, as well as a number of head-tail\nsources and smaller diffuse steep-spectrum radio sources. The origin of radio\nhalos and relics is still being debated, but over the last years it has become\nclear that the presence of these radio sources is closely related to galaxy\ncluster merger events. Here we present the results from the first LOFAR Low\nband antenna (LBA) observations of Abell 2256 between 18 and 67 MHz. To our\nknowledge, the image presented in this paper at 63 MHz is the deepest ever\nobtained at frequencies below 100 MHz in general. Both the radio halo and the\ngiant relic are detected in the image at 63 MHz, and the diffuse radio emission\nremains visible at frequencies as low as 20 MHz. The observations confirm the\npresence of a previously claimed ultra-steep spectrum source to the west of the\ncluster center with a spectral index of -2.3 \\pm 0.4 between 63 and 153 MHz.\nThe steep spectrum suggests that this source is an old part of a head-tail\nradio source in the cluster. For the radio relic we find an integrated spectral\nindex of -0.81 \\pm 0.03, after removing the flux contribution from the other\nsources. This is relatively flat which could indicate that the efficiency of\nparticle acceleration at the shock substantially changed in the last \\sim 0.1\nGyr due to an increase of the shock Mach number. In an alternative scenario,\nparticles are re-accelerated by some mechanism in the downstream region of the\nshock, resulting in the relatively flat integrated radio spectrum. In the radio\nhalo region we find indications of low-frequency spectral steepening which may\nsuggest that relativistic particles are accelerated in a rather inhomogeneous\nturbulent region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 20:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Most stars in our sample with signs of inner dust\ndissipation typically show accretion rates ten times lower and disk masses\nthree times smaller than the remaining objects.\n  The trends relating Macc with the near-IR excess and Mdisk extend those for T\nTauri stars, and are consistent with viscous disk models. The differences in\nthe inner gas dissipation timescale, and the relative position of the stars\nwith signs of inner dust clearing in the Macc-Mdisk plane, could be suggesting\na slightly faster evolution, and that a different process - such as\nphotoevaporation - plays a more relevant role in dissipating disks in the HAeBe\nregime compared to T Tauri stars. Our conclusions must consider the mismatch\nbetween the disk mass estimates from mm fluxes and the disk mass estimates from\naccretion, which we also find in HAeBe stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 20:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-23"}

Many recent studies\nhave shown that this does not include the formation of lighter elements (in\nparticular 38 < Z < 48). Among those, palladium (Pd) and especially silver (Ag)\nare expected to be key indicators of a possible second r-process, but until\nrecently they have been studied only in a few stars. Therefore we target Pd and\nAg in a large sample of stars and compare these abundances to those of Sr, Y,\nZr, Ba and Eu produced by the slow (s-) and rapid (r-) neutron-capture\nprocesses. Hereby we investigate the nature of the formation process of Ag and\nPd. Through a homogeneous 1D LTE analysis of 71 stars we derive stellar\nabundances using the spectrum synthesis code MOOG, and MARCS model atmospheres.\nWe calculate abundance ratio trends and compare the derived abundances to\nsite-dependent yield predictions (low mass O-Ne-Mg cc SN, and parametrised high\nentropy winds), to extract characteristics of the second r-process. The\nabundance ratios of the heavy elements yield correlations and\nanti-correlations. These trends lead to clear indications of the existence of a\nsecond/weak r-process, responsible for the formation of Pd and Ag. By comparing\nto the model predictions, we find that the conditions under which this process\ntakes place differ from the main r-process in needing lower neutron number\ndensities, neutron-to-seed ratios, entropies and/or favour higher electron\nabundances. Our analysis confirms that Pd and Ag form via a r-process that\ndiffers from the main r-process, the main and weak s-processes, and charged\nparticle freeze-outs. This process is efficiently working down to [Fe/H] = -3.3\n(where our sample ends).

To\nexplain the smallness of neutrino mass, in general, we require a heavy Majorana\nneutrino which is a natural candidate in SO(10) model. In minimal SO(10) model,\nthe symmetry breaking scale or the right-handed neutrino mass scale is close to\nthe GUT scale. It is not only beyond the reach of any present or future\ncollider search but the lepton asymmetry generated from its decay is in\nconflict with the gravitino constraint as well as unable to fit the neutrino\ndata. We show that addition of an extra fermion singlet can accommodate the\nobserved recent neutrino data in a supersymmetric SO(10) model. This model can\ngenerate the desired lepton asymmetry and provide TeV scale doubly-charged\nHiggs scalars to be detected at LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 21:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-23"}

Clinical data suggest that many\nsuch reactions involve immune mechanisms, and genetic association studies have\nidentified strong linkage between drug hypersensitivity reactions to several\ndrugs and specific HLA alleles. One of the strongest such genetic associations\nfound has been for the antiviral drug abacavir, which causes severe adverse\nreactions exclusively in patients expressing the HLA molecular variant B*57:01.\nAbacavir adverse reactions were recently shown to be driven by drug-specific\nactivation of cytokine-producing, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that required\nHLA-B*57:01 molecules for their function. However, the mechanism by which\nabacavir induces this pathologic T cell response remains unclear. Here we show\nthat abacavir can bind within the F-pocket of the peptide-binding groove of\nHLA-B*57:01 thereby altering its specificity. This supports a novel explanation\nfor HLA-linked idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions; namely that drugs can\nalter the repertoire of self-peptides presented to T cells thus causing the\nequivalent of an alloreactive T cell response. Indeed, we identified specific\nself-peptides that are presented only in the presence of abacavir, and that\nwere recognized by T cells of hypersensitive patients. The assays we have\nestablished can be applied to test additional compounds with suspected HLA\nlinked hypersensitivities in vitro.

In this work new near- and\nmid-IR color diagnostics are explored, aiming for improved efficiency - better\ncompleteness and less contamination - in selecting AGN out to very high\nredshifts. We restrict our study to the James Webb Space Telescope wavelength\nrange (0.6-27um). The criteria are created based on the predictions by\nstate-of-the-art galaxy and AGN templates covering a wide variety of galaxy\nproperties, and tested against control samples with deep multi-wavelength\ncoverage (ranging from the X-rays to radio frequencies). We show that the\ncolors Ks-[4.5], [4.5]-[8.0], and [8.0]-[24] are ideal as AGN/non-AGN\ndiagnostics at, respectively, z<~1, 1<~z<~2.5, and z>~2.5-3. However, when the\nsource redshift is unknown, these colors should be combined. We thus develop an\nimproved IR criterion (using Ks and IRAC bands, KI) as a new alternative at\nz<~2.5. KI does not show improved completeness (50-60% overall) in comparison\nto commonly used IRAC-based AGN criteria, but is less affected by non-AGN\ncontamination (revealing a >50-90% level of successful AGN selection). We also\npropose KIM (using Ks, IRAC, and MIPS-24um bands, KIM), which aims to select\nAGN hosts from local distances to as far back as the end of reionization\n(0<z<~7) with reduced non-AGN contamination. However, the necessary\ntesting-constraints and the small control-sample sizes prevent the confirmation\nof its improved efficiency at z<~2.5. Overall, KIM shows a ~30-40% completeness\nand a >70-90% level of successful AGN selection. KI and KIM are built to be\nreliable against a ~10-20% error in flux, are based on existing filters, and\nare suitable for immediate use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 May 2012 22:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

During RHIC running in\nthe year 2006 (6.8 inverse-pb, 56 % average polarization), an even larger A_N\nwas observed for the eta meson at forward rapidity for xF > 0.5.

They are at the origin of scaling laws obeyed by thermodynamic\nobservables close to second-order phase transitions resulting in the concept of\nuniversality classes, that is of paramount importance for the study of\norganizational principles of matter. Strikingly, in case such soft fluctuations\nare too abundant they may alter the nature of the phase transition profoundly;\nthe system might evade the critical state altogether by undergoing a\ndiscontinuous first-order transition into the ordered phase.\nFluctuation-induced first-order transitions have been discussed broadly and are\ngermane for superconductors, liquid crystals, or phase transitions in the early\nuniverse, but clear experimental confirmations remain scarce. Our results from\nneutron scattering and thermodynamics on the model Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)\nhelimagnet (HM) MnSi show that such a fluctuation-induced first-order\ntransition is realized between its paramagnetic and HM state with remarkable\nagreement between experiment and a theory put forward by Brazovskii. While our\nstudy clarifies the nature of the HM phase transition in MnSi that has puzzled\nscientists for several decades, more importantly, our conclusions entirely\nbased on symmetry arguments are also relevant for other DM-HMs with only weak\ncubic magnetic anisotropies.

Differential dynamic\nlogics have been implemented in automatic and interactive theorem provers and\nhave been used successfully to verify safety-critical applications in\nautomotive, aviation, railway, robotics, and analogue electrical circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 02:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

For classical T\nTauri stars (CTTSs), we also find strong correlations between these lines and\nthe accretion luminosity, suggesting that these lines form in processes related\nto accretion.

These correlations between FUV and optical\ndiagostics can be used to obtain rough estimates of FUV line fluxes from\noptical observations. Molecular hydrogen (H$_{2}$) emission is generally\npresent in the spectra of actively accreting CTTSs but not the weak-lined T\nTauri stars (WTTSs) that are not accreting. The presence of H$_2$ emission in\nthe spectrum of HD 98800 N suggests that the disk should be classified as\nactively accreting rather than a debris disk.

In the\ncomplex domain, we characterize the C^3 lifespan of the HCMA in terms of\nanalytic continuation of Hamiltonian mechanics and intersection of complex time\ncharacteristics. We use a conservation law type argument to prove uniqueness of\nsolutions of the Cauchy problem for the HCMA.

In order to\ndetermine the spectroscopic nature of HD207561, high-resolution spectroscopic\nand spectro-polarimetric observations were carried out. A reasonable fit of the\ncalculated Hbeta line profile to the observed one yields the effective\ntemperature (Teff) and surface gravity (log g) as 7300 K and 3.7 dex,\nrespectively.

Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong\nexploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The\nessence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other\nstate by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration\nalgorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited\nbefore. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems\nwould break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most\nphysical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we\naddress the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We\nfirst propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that\nimposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed\nsafe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed\nsafe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization\nformulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the\nguaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our\nframework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration\nmethods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a\nMartian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore\nbetter than classical exploration methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 06:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2012 09:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 20:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-10"}

In this paper\nthe primary focus will be on storing messages in encrypted format with a\npassword and send it to the required destination hiding in a QR Code, without\nbeing tracked or decrypted properly by any hacker or spyware.

The seismic data gathered by\nCoRoT on red giant stars allow us to test mode driving theory in physical\nconditions different from main-sequence stars. Using a set of 3D hydrodynamical\nmodels representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars, we\ncomputed the acoustic mode energy supply rate (Pmax). Assuming adiabatic\npulsations and using global stellar models that assume that the surface\nstratification comes from the 3D hydrodynamical models, we computed the mode\namplitude in terms of surface velocity. This was converted into intensity\nfluctuations using either a simplified adiabatic scaling relation or a\nnon-adiabatic one. From L and M (the luminosity and mass), the energy supply\nrate Pmax is found to scale as (L/M)^2.6 for both main-sequence and red giant\nstars, extending previous results. The theoretical amplitudes in velocity\nunder-estimate the Doppler velocity measurements obtained so far from the\nground for red giant stars by about 30%. In terms of intensity, the theoretical\nscaling law based on the adiabatic intensity-velocity scaling relation results\nin an under-estimation by a factor of about 2.5 with respect to the CoRoT\nseismic measurements. On the other hand, using the non-adiabatic\nintensity-velocity relation significantly reduces the discrepancy with the\nCoRoT data. The theoretical amplitudes remain 40% below, however, the CoRoT\nmeasurements. Our results show that scaling relations of mode amplitudes cannot\nbe simply extended from main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensity\non the basis of adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giant\nstars are important and cannot be neglected. We discuss possible reasons for\nthe remaining differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 09:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 09:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The model is explored for a\nsingle global region using two simple scenarios, a baseline and a mitigation\ncase where the price of carbon is gradually increased.

We find that only 28 stars (26 dwarfs\nand 2 giants) are members, i.e. that 46% of our candidates are members based on\nthe differential abundance analysis. This result confirms that the Hyades\nSupercluster cannot originate solely from the Hyades cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 10:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Out of the nine systems, there are five robust\ncandidates with a significant excess (higher that 50%) of lensing mass with\nrespect to stellar mass, irrespective of the stellar initial mass function. One\nof these lenses (Q0957) is located at the centre of a galactic cluster.

More generally, despite the ubiquity and\nthe great importance of clustering, we still do not have a satisfactory\nmathematical theory of clustering. In order to properly understand clustering,\nit is clearly necessary to develop a solid theoretical basis for the area. For\nexample, from the perspective of computational complexity theory the clustering\nproblem seems very hard. Numerous papers introduce various criteria and\nnumerical measures to quantify the quality of a given clustering. The resulting\nconclusions are pessimistic, since it is computationally difficult to find an\noptimal clustering of a given data set, if we go by any of these popular\ncriteria. In contrast, the practitioners' perspective is much more optimistic.\nOur explanation for this disparity of opinions is that complexity theory\nconcentrates on the worst case, whereas in reality we only care for data sets\nthat can be clustered well.\n  We introduce a theoretical framework of clustering in metric spaces that\nrevolves around a notion of \"good clustering\".

New data sets not available in previous\nstudies, such as high-resolution interferometric imaging with the Plateau de\nBure Interferometer (PdBI) at lambda = 1.3 mm and SED measured with IRS on the\nSpitzer Space Telescope in the mid-infrared, put strong constraints on\npredictions and are likely to provide new insights into the evolutionary state\nof this object.\n  A parameter study based on simulated annealing was performed to find unbiased\nbest-fit models for independent observations made in the wavelength domain\nlambda ~ 1 micron ... 4 mm.

The first answer to this question, entirely based\non Physics, was given by Ehrenfest, in 1917, who showed that the stability\nrequirement for $n$-dimensional two-body planetary system very strongly\nconstrains space dimensionality, favoring 3-d. This kind of approach will be\ngenerically called \"stability postulate\" throughout this paper and was shown by\nTangherlini, in 1963, to be still valid in the framework of general relativity\nas well as for quantum mechanical hydrogen atom, giving the same constraint for\nspace-dimensionality. In the present work, before criticizing this methodology,\na brief discussion has been introduced, aimed at stressing and clarifying some\ngeneral physical aspects of the problem of how to determine the number of space\ndimensions. Then, the epistemological consequences of Ehrenfest's methodology\nare critically reviewed. An alternative procedure to get at the proper number\nof dimensions, in which the stability postulate (and the implicit singularities\nin three-dimensional physics) are not an essential part of the argument, is\nproposed. In this way, the main epistemological problems contained in\nEhrenfest's original idea are avoided. The alternative methodology proposed in\nthis paper is realized by obtaining and discussing the $n$-dimensional quantum\ntheory as expressed in Planck's law, de Broglie relation and the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relation. As a consequence, it is possible to propose an\nexperiment, based on thermal neutron diffraction by crystals, to directly\nmeasure space dimensionality. Finally the distinguished role of Maxwell's\nelectromagnetic theory in the determination of space dimensionality is\nstressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 13:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

We explore features in the concurrence indicative of\nretardation and show how these features evolve depending on the initial state\nof the system, distance between the atoms and the number of modes to which the\natoms are coupled. In particular, we consider the short-time and the long time\ndynamics for both the multi- and sub-wavelength distances between the atoms. It\nis found that the retardation effects can qualitatively modify the entanglement\ndynamics of the atoms not only at multi- but also at sub-wavelength distances.\nWe follow the temporal evolution of the concurrence and find that at short\ntimes of the evolution the retardation induces periodic sudden changes of\nentanglement. To analyze where the entanglement lies in the space spanned by\nthe state vectors of the system, we introduce the collective Dicke states of\nthe atomic system that explicitly account for the sudden changes as a periodic\nexcitation of the atomic system to the maximally entangled symmetric state. At\nlong times, the retardation gives rise to periodic beats in the concurrence\nthat resemble the phenomenon of collapses and revivals in the Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel. In addition, we identify parameter values and initial conditions at\nwhich the atoms remain separable or are entangled without retardation during\nthe entire evolution time, but exhibit the phenomena of sudden birth and sudden\ndeath of entanglement when the retardation is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 15:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this regard, one\nis faced with data which possess outliers, skewness and, simultaneously, due to\nthe nature of financial trading, one would like to be able to construct\nclusters with specific predictors that are fairly sparse. We develop a Bayesian\nmixture of lasso regressions with $t-$errors to reflect these specific demands.\nThe resulting model is necessarily complex and to fit the model to real data,\nwe develop a state-of-the-art Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC)\nalgorithm based upon sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The model and\nalgorithm are investigated on both simulated and real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 15:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-23"}

However, it remains difficult to set up these\ncalculations without expert knowledge. To facilitate the use of such methods,\nsoftware tools need to be available to support these methods and help to set up\nreasonable input files which will lower the barrier of entry for usage by\nnon-experts. Previous tools relies on specific annotations in structure files\nfor automatic and successful fragmentation such as residues in PDB files. We\npresent a general fragmentation methodology and accompanying tools called\nFragIt to help setup these calculations. FragIt uses the SMARTS language to\nlocate chemically appropriate fragments in large structures and is applicable\nto fragmentation of any molecular system given suitable SMARTS patterns. We\npresent SMARTS patterns of fragmentation for proteins, DNA and polysaccharides,\nspecifically for D-galactopyranose for use in cyclodextrins. FragIt is used to\nprepare input files for the Fragment Molecular Orbital method in the GAMESS\nprogram package, but can be extended to other computational methods easily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 14:39:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 12:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-20"}
