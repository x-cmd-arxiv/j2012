In this paper we study the non-variable hard TeV\nemission from a blazar. The multi-band emission consists of two components: one\nis the traditional synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the inner jet,\nand the other is the emission produced via SSC and IC scattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) photons (IC/CMB) and extragalactic background light\n(EBL) photons (IC/EBL) by relativistic electrons in the extended jet under the\nstochastic acceleration scenario. Such a model is applied to 1ES 1101-232. The\nresults indicate that (1) the non-variable hard TeV emission of 1ES 1101-232\ncan be reproduced well, which is dominated by IC/CMB emission from the extended\njet, using three characteristic values of Doppler factor ($\\delta_{\\rm\nD}=5,10,15$) for the TeV emitting region in the extended jet; and (2) in the\ncases of $\\delta_{\\rm D}=15$ and 10, the physical parameters can achieve the\nequipartition (or quasi-equipartition) between the relativistic electrons and\nthe magnetic field; In contrast, the physical parameters largely deviate from\nthe equipartition for the case of $\\delta_{\\rm D}=5$. It is therefore concluded\nthat the TeV emission region of 1ES 1101-232 in the extended jet should be\nmoderately or highly beamed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 16:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Unsupervised clustering and independent component\nanalysis (ICA) have been used to identify such spatio-temporal networks. While\nthese approaches have been useful for estimating these networks at the\nsubject-level, comparisons over groups or experimental conditions require\nfurther methodological development. In this paper, we tackle this problem by\nshowing how self-organizing maps (SOMs) can be compared within a Frechean\ninferential framework. Here, we summarize the mean SOM in each group as a\nFrechet mean with respect to a metric on the space of SOMs. We consider the use\nof different metrics, and introduce two extensions of the classical sum of\nminimum distance (SMD) between two SOMs, which take into account the\nspatio-temporal pattern of the fMRI data. The validity of these methods is\nillustrated on synthetic data. Through these simulations, we show that the\nthree metrics of interest behave as expected, in the sense that the ones\ncapturing temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal aspects of the SOMs are more\nlikely to reach significance under simulated scenarios characterized by\ntemporal, spatial and spatio-temporal differences, respectively.

Although the BAO signal in the skewness has a lower\namplitude than second order measures like the two-point correlation function\nand power spectrum, it has the advantage of a considerably lower sensitivity to\nsystematic influences. Because it lacks a direct dependence on bias if this\nconcerns simple linear bias, skewness will be considerably less beset by\nuncertainties due to galaxy bias. Also, it has a weaker sensitivity to redshift\ndistortion effects. We use perturbation theory to evaluate the magnitude of the\neffect on the volume-average skewness, for various cosmological models. One\nimportant finding of our analysis is that the skewness BAO signal occurs at\nsmaller scales than that in second order statistics. For an LCDM spectrum with\nWMAP7 normalization, the BAO feature has a maximum wiggle amplitude of ~3% and\nappears at a scale of ~82Mpc/h.

This\neffect is observed both for objects classified in blue light, and for those\nthat were classified in the infrared. This result suggests that the most\nluminous (massive) S0 galaxies find it difficult to form bars. As a result the\nmean luminosity of unbarred lenticular galaxies in both B and IR light is\nobserved to be ~0.4 mag brighter than than that of barred lenticulars. A small\ncontribution to the observed luminosity difference that is found between SA0\nand SB0 galaxies may also be due to the fact that there is an asymmetry between\nthe effects of small classification errors on SA0 and SB0 galaxies. An E galaxy\nmight be misclassified as an S0, or an S0 as an E. However, an E will never be\nmisclassified an SB0, nor will an SB0 ever be called an E. This asymmetry is\nimportant because elliptical (E) galaxies are typically twice as luminous as\nlenticular (S0) galaxies. The present results suggest that the evolution of\nluminous lenticular galaxies may be closely linked to that of elliptical\ngalaxies, whereas fainter lenticulars might be more closely associated with\nram-pressure stripped spiral galaxies.

In\npractice, pre-defined header sequences are used with the purpose of\nsynchronizing the different network nodes. However, in networks where relays\nmust be used for communication, the overhead required for synchronizing the\nentire network may be very significant.\n  In this work, we study the fundamental limits of energy-efficient\ncommunication in an asynchronous diamond network with two relays. We formalize\nthe notion of relay synchronization by saying that a relay is synchronized if\nthe conditional entropy of the arrival time of the source message given the\nreceived signals at the relay is small. We show that the minimum energy-per-bit\nfor bursty traffic in diamond networks is achieved with a coding scheme where\neach relay is either synchronized or not used at all. A consequence of this\nresult is the derivation of a lower bound to the minimum energy-per-bit for\nbursty communication in diamond networks. This bound allows us to show that\nschemes that perform the tasks of synchronization and communication separately\n(i.e., with synchronization signals preceding the communication block) can\nachieve the minimum energy-per-bit to within a constant fraction that ranges\nfrom 2 in the synchronous case to 1 in the highly asynchronous regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 18:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 14:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

Among recoiling AGN\ncandidates, CID-42 alone has both spatial offsets (in optical and X-ray bands)\nand spectroscopic offsets. In order to constrain the relative likelihood of\nboth scenarios, we develop models using hydrodynamic galaxy merger simulations\ncoupled with radiative transfer calculations. Our gas-rich, major merger models\nare generally well matched to the galactic morphology and to the inferred\nstellar mass and star formation rate. We show that a recoiling supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH) in CID-42 should be observable as an AGN at the time of\nobservation. However, in order for the recoiling AGN to produce narrow-line\nemission, it must be observed shortly after the kick while it still inhabits a\ndense gaseous region, implying a large total kick velocity (v_k > 2000 km\ns^-1). For the dual AGN scenario, an unusually large broad-line offset is\nrequired, and the best match to the observed morphology requires a galaxy that\nis less luminous than CID-42. Further, the lack of X-ray emission from one of\nthe two optical nuclei is not easily attributed to an intrinsically quiescent\nSMBH or to a Compton-thick galactic environment. While the current data do not\nallow either the recoiling or the dual AGN scenario for CID-42 to be excluded,\nour models highlight the most relevant parameters for distinguishing these\npossibilities with future observations.

NGC 2146 is part of the\nSnapshot Hubble U-band Cluster Survey (SHUCS). The WFC3/F336W data has added\ncritical information to the available archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging\nset of NGC 2146, allowing us to determine ages, masses, and extinctions of the\nclusters in the Ruby Ring.

We find evidence of a spatial and\ntemporal correlation between the central cluster and the clusters in the ring.\nThe latter are about 4 Myr younger than the central cluster, which has an age\nof 7 Myr. This result is supported by the H alpha emission which is strongly\ncoincident with the ring, and weaker at the position of the central cluster.\nFrom the derived total H alpha luminosity of the system we constrain the star\nformation rate density to be quite high, e.g. ~ 0.47 Msun/yr/kpc^2.

The total\namount of dust formed for a given mass experiencing HBB increases with\nmetallicity, because of the higher abundance of silicon, and the softer HBB,\nboth factors favouring a higher rate of silicates production. This behaviour is\nnot found in low mass stars,because the carbon enrichment of the stellar\nsurface layers, due to repeated Third Drege Up episodes, is almost independent\nof the metallicity.

We consider the formation of molecular cloud by\naccretion of the HI clouds as suggested in recent observations. The simulation\nshows that the initial HI medium is compressed and piled up behind the shock\nwaves induced by the accretion flows. Since the initial medium is highly\ninhomogeneous as a consequence of the thermal instability, the formed molecular\ncloud becomes very turbulent owing to the development of the Richtmyer-Meshkov\ninstability. The structure of the post shock region is composed of dense cold\ngas (T<100 K) and diffuse warm gas (T>1,000 K), which are spatially well mixed\nowing to the turbulence. Because the energy source of the turbulence is the\naccretion flows, the turbulence is highly anisotropic biased toward the\ndirection of accretion flows. The kinetic energy of the turbulence dominates\nthe thermal, magnetic, and gravitational energies in the total 10 Myr\nevolution. However, the kinetic energy measured by using the\nCO-fraction-weighted density is comparable to the other energies. This suggests\nthat the true kinetic energy of turbulence in molecular cloud as a hole can be\nmuch larger than the kinetic energy of turbulence estimated by line-width of\nmolecular emissions.

To demonstrate the method, we apply the\nalgorithm to two classification problems. Firstly, it is applied to the well\nknown period-period derivative diagram, where we find that the pulsar\ndistribution can be modeled with six Gaussian clusters, with two clusters for\nmillisecond pulsars (recycled pulsars) and the rest for normal pulsars. From\nthis distribution, we derive an empirical definition for millisecond pulsars as\n$\\frac{\\dot{P}}{10^{-17}} \\leq3.23(\\frac{P}{100 \\textrm{ms}})^{-2.34}$. The two\nmillisecond pulsar clusters may have different evolutionary origins, since the\ncompanion stars to these pulsars in the two clusters show different chemical\ncomposition. Four clusters are found for normal pulsars. Possible implications\nfor these clusters are also discussed.

The whole story can be regarded as a realization of the bulk-edge\ncorrespondence peculiar to the chiral symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 09:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In the case of proper complex Gaussian noise, the maximum\nentropy theorem shows that the best-response strategy is to transmit with\nproper signals (symmetric complex Gaussian symbols). However, such equilibrium\nleads to degrees-of-freedom zero due to the saturation of interference.\n  With improper signals (asymmetric complex Gaussian symbols), an extra freedom\nof optimization is available. In this paper, we study the impact of improper\nsignaling on the 2-user SISO IC. We explore the achievable rate region with\nnon-cooperative strategies by computing a Nash equilibrium of a non-cooperative\ngame with improper signaling. Then, assuming cooperation between players, we\nstudy the achievable rate region of improper signals. We propose the usage of\nimproper rank one signals for their simplicity and ease of implementation.\nDespite their simplicity, rank one signals achieve close to optimal sum rate\ncompared to full rank improper signals. We characterize the Pareto boundary,\nthe outer-boundary of the achievable rate region, of improper rank one signals\nwith a single real-valued parameter; we compute the closed-form solution of the\nPareto boundary with the non-zero-forcing strategies, the maximum sum rate\npoint and the max-min fairness solution with zero-forcing strategies.

However,\nobservations of young binary populations suggest a log-uniform distribution.\nClearly some process(es) change the period distribution over time. Most stars\nform in star clusters, in which two important dynamical processes occur: i)\ngas-induced orbital decay of embedded binary systems and ii) destruction of\nsoft binaries in three-body interactions. The emphasis here is on orbital decay\nwhich has been largely neglected so far. Using a combination of Monte-Carlo and\ndynamical nbody modelling it is demonstrated here that the cluster dynamics\ndestroys the number of wide binaries, but leaves short-period binaries\nbasically undisturbed even for a initially log-uniform distribution. By\ncontrast orbital decay significantly reduces the number and changes the\nproperties of short-period binaries, but leaves wide binaries largely\nuneffected. Until now it was unclear whether the short period distribution of\nthe field is unaltered since its formation. It is shown here, that orbital\ndecay is a prime candidate for such a task. In combination the dynamics of\nthese two processes, convert an initial log-uniform distribution to a\nlog-normal period distribution. The probability is 94% that the evolved and\nobserved period distribution were sampled from the same parent distribution.\nThis means binaries can be formed with periods that are sampled from the\nlog-uniform distribution. As the cluster evolves, short-period binaries are\nmerged to single stars by the gas-induced orbital decay while the dynamical\nevolution in the cluster destroys wide binaries. The combination of these two\nequally important processes reshapes a initial log-uniform period distribution\nto the log-normal period distribution, that is observed in the field\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 09:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Combining\nthis measurement with constraints on the \"microlens parallax\" and the lens\nflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13<M/M_\\odot<1.0$. In\nthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax and\nplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planet\nmasses.

It remains a puzzle as to why dynamical\nfriction has not yet dragged any of Fornax's five globular clusters to the\ncentre, and also why there is no evidence that any similar star cluster has\nbeen in the past (for Fornax or any other dSph). We set up a suite of 2800\nN-body simulations that sample the full range of globular-cluster orbits and\nmass models consistent with all existing observational constraints for Fornax.\nIn agreement with previous work, we find that if Fornax has a large dark-matter\ncore then its globular clusters remain close to their currently observed\nlocations for long times. Furthermore, we find previously unreported behaviour\nfor clusters that start inside the core region. These are pushed out of the\ncore and gain orbital energy, a process we call 'dynamical buoyancy'. Thus a\ncored mass distribution in Fornax will naturally lead to a shell-like globular\ncluster distribution near the core radius, independent of the initial\nconditions. By contrast, CDM-type cusped mass distributions lead to the rapid\ninfall of at least one cluster within \\Delta t = 1-2Gyr, except when picking\nunlikely initial conditions for the cluster orbits (\\sim 2% probability), and\nalmost all clusters within \\Delta t = 10Gyr. Alternatively, if Fornax has only\na weakly cusped mass distribution, dynamical friction is much reduced. While\nover \\Delta t = 10Gyr this still leads to the infall of 1-4 clusters from their\npresent orbits, the infall of any cluster within \\Delta t = 1-2Gyr is much less\nlikely (with probability 0-70%, depending on \\Delta t and the strength of the\ncusp). Such a solution to the timing problem requires that in the past the\nglobular clusters were somewhat further from Fornax than today; they most\nlikely did not form within Fornax, but were accreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 11:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This is mainly a radial integral of the local surface density\nweighted by a regular \"mean Green function\" which depends explicitly on the\nbody's vertical thickness. Rigorously, this result stands for a wide variety of\nconfigurations, as soon as the density structure is vertically homogeneous.\nNevertheless, the sensitivity to vertical stratification | the Gaussian profile\nhas been considered | appears weak provided that the surface density is\nconserved. For bodies with small aspect ratio (i.e. geometrically thin discs),\na first-order Taylor expansion furnishes an excellent approximation for this\nmean Green function, the absolute error being of the fourth order in the aspect\nratio. This formula is therefore well suited to studying the structure of\nself-gravitating discs and rings in the spirit of the \"standard model of thin\ndiscs\" where the vertical structure is often ignored, but it remains accurate\nfor discs and tori of finite thickness. This approximation which perfectly\nsaves the properties of Newton's law everywhere (in particular at large\nseparations), is also very useful for dynamical studies where the body is just\na source of gravity acting on external test particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 12:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Crucial parameters for such bio-imaging beamline are photon energy\nrange, peak power, and pulse duration. Key component of the setup is the\nundulator source. The peak power is maximized in the photon energy range\nbetween 3 keV and 13 keV by the use of a very efficient combination of\nself-seeding, fresh bunch and tapered undulator techniques. The unique\ncombination of ultra-high peak power of 1 TW in the entire energy range, and\nultrashort pulse duration tunable from 2 fs to 10 fs, would allow for single\nshot coherent imaging of protein molecules with size larger than 10 nm. Also,\nthe new beamline would enable imaging of large biological structures in the\nwater window, between 0.3 keV and 0.4 keV. In order to make use of standardized\ncomponents, at present we favor the use of SASE3-type undulator segments. The\nnumber segments, 40, is determined by the tapered length for the design output\npower of 1 TW. The present plan assumes the use of a nominal electron bunch\nwith charge of 0.1 nC.

Therefore, the total amount of scheduled\nbeam time per year is expected to be up to 4000 hours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 12:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-30"}

In order to confirm the Kerr-nature of these\nobjects, we need to probe the geometry of the space-time around them and see if\nthe observations are consistent with the predictions of the Kerr metric. That\ncan be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some\nstellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of\nthese oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is\nthought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this\npaper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and\nI extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging\npicture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is\na larger number of possible combinations between different modes. I then\ncompare the bounds inferred from the twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations observed in three micro-quasars (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, and\nGRS 1915+105) with the measurements from the continuum-fitting method of the\nsame objects. For Kerr black holes, the two approaches do not provide\nconsistent results. In a non-Kerr geometry, this conflict may be solved if the\nobserved quasi-periodic oscillations are produced by the resonance $\\nu_\\theta\n: \\nu_r = 3:1$, where $\\nu_\\theta$ and $\\nu_r$ are the two epicyclic\nfrequencies. It is at least worth mentioning that the deformation from the Kerr\nsolution required by observations would be consistent with the one suggested in\nanother recent work discussing the possibility that steady jets are powered by\nthe spin of these compact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 12:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 15:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-12"}

Such problems arise when\none aims at accounting for a physical hypersurface (or line, for bi-dimensional\nproblem), but also in the context of fictitious domain methods, when one aims\nat accounting for the presence of an inclusion in a domain (in that case the\nsupport of the distribution is the boundary of the inclusion). The most popular\nway to handle numerically the single layer distribution in the finite element\ncontext is to spread it out by a regularization technique. An alternative\napproach consists in approximating the single layer distribution by a\ncombination of Dirac masses. As the Dirac mass in the right hand side does not\nmake sense at the continuous level, this approach raises particular issues. The\nobject of the present paper is to give a theoretical background to this\napproach. We present a rigorous numerical analysis of this approximation, and\nwe present two examples of application of the main result of this paper. The\nfirst one is a Poisson problem with a single layer distribution as a right-hand\nside and the second one is another Poisson problem where the single layer\ndistribution is the Lagrange multiplier used to enforce a Dirichlet boundary\ncondition on the boundary of an inclusion in the domain.

On average, M33 clusters are more\nflattened than those of the Milky Way and M31, and more similar to clusters in\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud. The ellipticities do not show any correlation with\nage or mass, suggesting that rotation is not the main cause of elongation in\nthe M33 clusters. The position angles of the clusters show a bimodality with a\nstrong peak perpendicular to the position angle of the galaxy major axis.

Due to their high frequency of occurrence, their presence in\ntext mining presents an obstacle to the understanding of the content in the\ndocuments. To eliminate the bias effects, most text mining software or\napproaches make use of stop words list to identify and remove those words.\nHowever, the development of such top words list is difficult and inconsistent\nbetween textual sources. This problem is further aggravated by sources such as\nTwitter which are highly repetitive or similar in nature. In this paper, we\nwill be examining the original work using term frequency, inverse document\nfrequency and term adjacency for developing a stop words list for the Twitter\ndata source. We propose a new technique using combinatorial values as an\nalternative measure to effectively list out stop words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 15:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-30"}

The\nsame value of the Blazhko period is observed at different values of the\npulsation periods and different values of the Blazhko periods are observed at\nthe same value of the pulsation period. There are clues suggesting that the\nBlazhko effect is changing from one cycle to the next. The secular changes in\nthe pulsation and Blazhko periods of Z CVn are anticorrelated. The diagrams of\nmagnitudes against phases of the maxima clearly show that the light curves of\nBlazhko variables can be explained as modulated signals, both in amplitude and\nin frequency. The closed curves describing the Blazhko cycles in such diagrams\nhave different shapes, reflecting the phase shifts between the epochs of the\nbrightest maximum and the maximum O-C. Our sample shows that both clockwise and\nanticlockwise directions are possible for similar shapes. The improved\nobservational knowledge of the Blazhko effect, in addition to some\npeculiarities of the light curves, have still to be explained by a satisfactory\nphysical mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 15:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Frequency analyses of the V2052 Oph data\nenabled the detection of three pulsation frequencies, the first harmonic of the\nstrongest signal, and the rotation frequency with its first harmonic.\nPulsational mode identification from analysing the colour amplitude ratios\nconfirms the dominant mode as being radial, whereas the other two oscillations\nare most likely l=4. Combining seismic constraints on the inclination of the\nrotation axis with published magnetic field analyses we conclude that the\nradial mode must be the fundamental. The rotational light modulation is in\nphase with published spectroscopic variability, and consistent with an oblique\nrotator for which both magnetic poles pass through the line of sight. The\ninclination of the rotation axis is 54o <i< 58o and the magnetic obliquity 58o\n<beta< 66o. The possibility that V2052 Oph has a magnetically confined wind is\ndiscussed. The photometric amplitudes of the single oscillation of V986 Oph are\nmost consistent with an l=3 mode, but this identification is uncertain.\nAdditional intrinsic, apparently temporally incoherent, light variations of\nV986 Oph are reported. Different interpretations thereof cannot be\ndistinguished at this point, but this kind of variability appears to be present\nin many OB stars. The prospects of obtaining asteroseismic information for more\nrapidly rotating Beta Cep stars, which appear to prefer modes of higher l, are\nbriefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 15:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
