The model undergoes\ntwo phase transitions as a function of temperature. At low temperature, thermal\nfluctuations induce magnetic long-range order by order-by-disorder mechanism.\nMagnetically ordered state with the spontaneously broken $Z_6$ symmetry\npersists up to a certain critical temperature. We find that there is an\nintermediate phase between the low-temperature ordered phase and the\nhigh-temperature disordered phase. The finite-sized scaling analysis suggests\nthat the intermediate phase is a critical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase with\ncontinuously variable exponents.

Unlike the traditional\ngovernments, an e-government takes on a new look with its framework and\noperation mode more suitable for the contemporary era. In fact, it is a basic\nnational strategy to promote Saudi Arabia's informatization by means of\ne-government construction. This talk firstly introduces the basic concepts and\nrelevant viewpoints of egovernment, then reviews the development process of\ne-government in Saudi Arabia, and describes the current states, development\nstrategies of e-government in Saudi Arabia. And also review e-government\nmaturity models and synthesize them e-government maturity models are\ninvestigated, in which the authors have proposed the Delloite's six-stage\nmodel, Layne and Lee four-stage model and Accenture five-stage model. So, the\nmain e-government maturity stages are: online presence, interaction,\ntransaction, transformation and digital democracy.

This\nphilosophy is inapplicable for testing hypotheses for a single parameter like\nthe population mean, since the two assumptions are contradictory (e.g., how can\nwe assume both that the mean of the population is $\\mu_0,$ and that the\nindividuals in the sample with a mean $M \\ne \\mu_0$ are representative of the\npopulation?). The Mirror Bootstrap resolves that conundrum. The philosophy of\nthe Mirror Bootstrap method for testing hypotheses regarding one population\nparameter is that we assume both that the null hypothesis is true, and that the\nindividuals in our sample are as representative as they could be without\nassuming more extreme cases than observed. For example, the Mirror Bootstrap\nmethod for testing hypotheses of one mean uses a generated symmetric\ndistribution constructed by reflecting the original sample around the\nhypothesized population mean $\\mu_0$. Simulations of the performance of the\nMirror Bootstrap for testing hypotheses of one mean show that, while the method\nis slightly on the conservative side for very small samples, its validity and\npower quickly approach that of the widely used t-test. The philosophy of the\nMirror Bootstrap is sufficiently general to be adapted for testing hypotheses\nabout other parameters; this exploration is left for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 17:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-18"}

In this work, we compare the mean-square performance\nof two main strategies for distributed estimation over networks: consensus\nstrategies and diffusion strategies. The analysis in the paper confirms that\nunder constant step-sizes, diffusion strategies allow information to diffuse\nmore thoroughly through the network and this property has a favorable effect on\nthe evolution of the network: diffusion networks are shown to converge faster\nand reach lower mean-square deviation than consensus networks, and their\nmean-square stability is insensitive to the choice of the combination weights.\nIn contrast, and surprisingly, it is shown that consensus networks can become\nunstable even if all the individual nodes are stable and able to solve the\nestimation task on their own. When this occurs, cooperation over the network\nleads to a catastrophic failure of the estimation task. This phenomenon does\nnot occur for diffusion networks: we show that stability of the individual\nnodes always ensures stability of the diffusion network irrespective of the\ncombination topology.

The dilaton\neffective action is obtained up to 6th order in derivatives. The anomaly flow\na_UV - a_IR is the coefficient of the 6-derivative Euler anomaly term in this\naction. It then appears at order p^6 in the low energy limit of n-point\nscattering amplitudes of the dilaton for n > 3. The detailed structure with the\ncorrect anomaly coefficient is confirmed by direct calculation in two examples:\n(i) the case of explicitly broken conformal symmetry is illustrated by the free\nmassive scalar field, and (ii) the case of spontaneously broken conformal\nsymmetry is demonstrated by the (2,0) theory on the Coulomb branch. In the\nlatter example, the dilaton is a dynamical field so 4-derivative terms in the\naction also affect n-point amplitudes at order p^6. The calculation in the\n(2,0) theory is done by analyzing an M5-brane probe in AdS_7 x S^4.\n  Given the confirmation in two distinct models, we attempt to use dispersion\nrelations to prove that the anomaly flow is positive in general. Unfortunately\nthe 4-point matrix element of the Euler anomaly is proportional to stu and\nvanishes for forward scattering. Thus the optical theorem cannot be applied to\nshow positivity. Instead the anomaly flow is given by a dispersion sum rule in\nwhich the integrand does not have definite sign.

A first inspection reveals\nthe presence of many difficulties but - quite surprisingly - most of them have\nan interesting solution. In particular, it is possible to regularize the\nlattice theory on a Lefschetz thimble, where the imaginary part of the action\nis constant and disappears from all observables. This regularization can be\njustified in terms of symmetries and perturbation theory. Moreover, it is\npossible to design a Monte Carlo algorithm that samples the configurations in\nthe thimble. This is done by simulating, effectively, a five dimensional\nsystem. We describe the algorithm in detail and analyze its expected cost and\nstability.

Though the\ntidal perturbation induced by Earth and super-Earth mass planets is generally\ntoo weak to significantly modify the structure of the disk, the interaction is\npotentially strong enough to cause the planets to undergo rapid type I\nmigration. This physical process may provide a source of short-period\nsuper-Earths, though it may also pose a challenge to the emergence and\nretention of cores on long-period orbits with sufficient mass to evolve into\ngas giants. Previous numerical simulations have shown that the type I migration\nrate sensitively depends upon the circumstellar disk's properties, particularly\nthe temperature and surface density gradients. Here, we derive these structure\nparameters for 1) a self-consistent viscous-disk model based on a constant\n\\alpha-prescription, 2) an irradiated disk model that takes into account\nheating due to the absorption of stellar photons, and 3) a layered-accretion\ndisk model with variable \\alpha-parameter. We show that in the inner\nviscously-heated regions of typical protostellar disks, the horseshoe and\ncorotation torques of super-Earths can exceed their differential Lindblad\ntorque and cause them to undergo outward migration. However, the temperature\nprofile due to passive stellar irradiation causes type I migration to be\ninwards throughout much of the disk. For disks in which there is outwards\nmigration, we show that location and the mass range of the \"planet traps\"\ndepends on some uncertain assumptions adopted for these disk models. Competing\nphysical effects may lead to dispersion in super-Earths' mass-period\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 19:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Two of these stars have been confirmed in our recent integral field\nspectroscopy data and we will discuss them in more detail here. These two red\ngiants are located at a projected distance of ~ 0.3 pc from the center.\nAccording to their positions on the color magnitude diagram, both stars are\ncluster members. We investigate several possible origins for the high\nvelocities of the stars and conceivable ejection mechanisms. Since the\nvelocities are close to the escape velocity, it is not obvious whether the\nstars are bound or unbound to the cluster. We therefore consider both cases in\nour analysis. We perform numerical simulations of three-body dynamical\nencounters between binaries and single stars and compare the resulting velocity\ndistributions of escapers with the velocities of our stars. We compare the\npredictions for a single dynamical encounter with a compact object with those\nof a sequence of two-body encounters due to relaxation. If the stars are\nunbound, the encounter must have taken place recently, when the stars were\nalready in the giant phase. After including binary fractions and black-hole\nretention fractions, projection effects, and detection probabilities from\nMonte-Carlo simulations, we estimate the expected numbers of detections for all\nthe different scenarios. Based on these numbers, we conclude that the most\nlikely scenario is that the stars are bound and were accelerated by a single\nencounter between a binary of main-sequence stars and a ~ 10 M_sun black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Galaxies were selected from The Optically Unbiased GRB Host (TOUGH)\nsurvey (15 of the 19 galaxies) or because they hosted GRBs without a bright\noptical afterglow. Here, we provide emission-line redshifts for 13 of the\nobserved galaxies with brightnesses between F606W > 27 mag and R=22.9 mag\n(median R=24.6 mag). The median redshift is z=2.1 for all, and z=2.3 for the\nTOUGH hosts. Our new data significantly improve the redshift completeness of\nthe TOUGH survey, which now stands at 77% (53 out of 69 GRBs). They furthermore\nprovide accurate redshifts for nine prototype-dark GRBs (e.g., GRBs 071021 at\nz=2.452 and 080207 at z=2.086), which are exemplary of GRBs where redshifts are\nchallenging to obtain via afterglow spectroscopy. This establishes X-shooter\nspectroscopy as an efficient tool for redshift determination of faint,\nstar-forming, high-redshift galaxies such as GRB hosts. It is hence a further\nstep towards removing the bias in GRB samples that is caused by optically-dark\nevents, and provides the basis for a better understanding of the conditions in\nwhich GRBs form. The distribution of column densities as measured from X-ray\ndata (N_{H,X}), for example, is closely related to the darkness of the\nafterglow and skewed towards low N_{H, X} values in samples that are dominated\nby bursts with bright optical afterglows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 20:01:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2012 12:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

Based on a mass complete (M_star >= 6x10^10 Msun), spectroscopic\nsample from the UKIDSS Ultra-deep Survey (UDS), with accurate stellar-mass\nmeasurements derived from spectro photometric fitting, we find that at z~1.4\nthe location of massive galaxies on the size-mass plane is determined primarily\nby their sSFR. At this epoch we find that massive galaxies which are passive\n(sSFR <= 0.1 Gyr^-1) follow a tight size-mass relation, with half-light radii a\nfactor f=2.4+/-0.2 smaller than their local counterparts. Moreover, amongst the\npassive sub-sample we find no evidence that the off-set from the local\nsize-mass relation is a function of stellar population age. Based on a\nsub-sample with dynamical mass estimates we also derive an independent estimate\nof f=2.3+/-0.3 for the typical growth in half-light radius between z~1.4 and\nthe present day. Focusing on the passive sub-sample, we conclude that to\nproduce the necessary evolution predominantly via major mergers would require\nan unfeasible number of merger events and over populate the high-mass end of\nthe local stellar mass function. In contrast, we find that a scenario in which\nmass accretion is dominated by minor mergers can produce the necessary\nevolution, whereby an increase in stellar mass by a factor of ~2, accompanied\nby an increase in size by a factor of ~3.5, is sufficient to reconcile the\nsize-mass relation at z~1.4 with that observed locally.

Only by means of a\nsignificant nuclear fusion amplification of the tidal gravitational potential\nenergy released in the Sun, may planetary tides produce irradiance output\noscillations with a sufficient magnitude to influence solar dynamo processes.\nHere we use an adaptation of the well-known mass-luminosity relation to\ncalculate a conversion factor between the solar luminosity and the potential\ngravitational power associated to the mass lost by nuclear fusion: the average\nestimated amplification factor is A=4,250,000. We use this magnification factor\nto evaluate the theoretical luminosity oscillations that planetary tides may\npotentially stimulate inside the solar core by making its nuclear fusion rate\noscillate. By converting the power related to this energy into solar irradiance\nunits at 1 AU we find that the tidal oscillations may be able to theoretically\ninduce an oscillating luminosity increase from 0.05-0.65 $W/m^{2}$ to 0.25-1.63\n$W/m^{2}$, which is a range compatible with the ACRIM satellite observed total\nsolar irradiance fluctuations.

This in turn implied that the\nneutrino driven wind is proton rich during its entire life, precluding\n$r$-process nucleosynthesis and the synthesis of Sr, Y, and Zr. This work\nrelied on charged current neutrino interaction rates that are appropriate for a\nfree nucleon gas. Here, it is shown in detail that the inclusion of the nucleon\npotential energies and collisional broadening of the response significantly\nalters this conclusion. Iso-vector interactions, which give rise to the nuclear\nsymmetry energy, produce a difference between the neutron and proton\nsingle-particle energies $\\Delta U=U_n-U_p$ and alter the kinematics of the\ncharged current reactions. In neutron-rich matter, and for a given\nneutrino/antineutrino energy, the rate for $\\nu_e+n\\rightarrow e^-+p$ is\nenhanced while $ \\bar{\\nu}_e+p\\rightarrow n+e^+$ is suppressed because the $Q$\nvalue for these reactions is altered by $\\pm\\Delta U$, respectively.

Therefore, electron neutrinos decouple at lower\ntemperature than when the nucleons are assumed to be free and have lower\naverage energies. The change is large enough to allow for a reasonable period\nof time when the neutrino driven wind is predicted to be neutron rich.

If all of the magnetic flux of a typical core were to be dragged into\nthe central star, the stellar field strength would be orders of magnitude\nhigher than the observed values. This well-known \"magnetic flux problem\" can in\nprinciple be resolved through non-ideal MHD effects. Two dimensional\n(axisymmetric) calculations have shown that ambipolar diffusion, in particular,\ncan transport magnetic flux outward relative to matter, allowing material to\nenter the central object without dragging the field lines along. We show\nthrough simulations that such axisymmetric protostellar accretion flows are\nunstable in three dimensions to magnetic interchange instability in the\nazimuthal direction. The instability is driven by the magnetic flux\nredistributed from the matter that enters the central object. It typically\nstarts to develop during the transition from the prestellar phase of star\nformation to the protostellar mass accretion phase. In the latter phase, the\nmagnetic flux is transported outward mainly through advection, by strongly\nmagnetized low-density regions that expand against the collapsing inflow. The\ntussle between the gravity-driven infall and magnetically driven expansion\nleads to a filamentary inner accretion flow, more disordered than previously\npictured. The efficient outward transport of magnetic flux by advection lowers\nthe field strength at small radii, making the magnetic braking less efficient\nand the formation of rotationally supported disks easier in principle. However,\nwe find no evidence for such disks in any of our rotating collapse simulations.\nWe conclude that the inner protostellar accretion flow is shaped to a large\nextent by this magnetic interchange instability. How disks form in such an\nenvironment is unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 06:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

While the particular importance of outflows in\nactive star forming regions is subject of debate, the quiet nature of the gas\nin B59 makes it a good site to directly see the impact of protostellar feedback\non the quiescent dense gas. Using HARP at the JCMT, we mapped the B59 region\nwith the J=3-2 transition of 12CO to study the kinematics and energetics of the\noutflows, and 13CO and C18O to study the overall dynamics of the ambient cloud,\nthe physical properties of the gas, and the hierarchical structure of the\nregion. The B59 region has a total of 30Msun of cold and quiescent material,\nmostly gravitationally bound, with narrow line widths throughout. Such low\nlevels of turbulence in non-star-forming sites of B59 are indicative of the\nintrinsic initial conditions of the cloud. On the other hand, close to the\nforming protostars the impact of the outflows is observed as a localised\nincrease of both line widths from 0.3 to 1 km/s, and 13CO excitation\ntemperatures by 2-3K. The impact of the outflows is also evident in the low\ncolumn density material which shows signs of being pushed, shaped and carved by\nthe outflow bow shocks as they pierce their way out of the cloud. Much of this\nstructure is readily apparent in a dendrogram analysis of the cloud. The low\nmass of B59 together with its intrinsically quiescent gas and small number of\nprotostars, allows the identification of specific regions where the outflows\nfrom the embedded sources interact the dense gas. Our study suggests that\noutflows are an important mechanism for injecting and sustaining supersonic\nturbulence at sub-parsec size scales. We find that less than half of the\noutflow energy is deposited as turbulent energy of the gas, however this\nturbulent energy is sufficient to slow down the collapse of the region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 07:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 09:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We report the\nfirst measurement of high harmonics from oriented gas samples. We determine the\nphase asymmetry of the attosecond XUV pulses emitted when an electron\nrecollides from opposite sides of the CO molecule, and the phase asymmetry of\nthe recollision electron just before recombination. We discuss how the various\ncontributions to asymmetry can be isolated in future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 08:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-21"}

The mainstream approach would be to learn an\novercomplete dictionary to provide good approximations of the training samples\nusing sparse synthesis coefficients. This famous sparse model has a less well\nknown counterpart, in analysis form, called the cosparse analysis model. In\nthis new model, signals are characterised by their parsimony in a transformed\ndomain using an overcomplete (linear) analysis operator. We propose to learn an\nanalysis operator from a training corpus using a constrained optimisation\nframework based on L1 optimisation. The reason for introducing a constraint in\nthe optimisation framework is to exclude trivial solutions. Although there is\nno final answer here for which constraint is the most relevant constraint, we\ninvestigate some conventional constraints in the model adaptation field and use\nthe uniformly normalised tight frame (UNTF) for this purpose. We then derive a\npractical learning algorithm, based on projected subgradients and\nDouglas-Rachford splitting technique, and demonstrate its ability to robustly\nrecover a ground truth analysis operator, when provided with a clean training\nset, of sufficient size. We also find an analysis operator for images, using\nsome noisy cosparse signals, which is indeed a more realistic experiment. As\nthe derived optimisation problem is not a convex program, we often find a local\nminimum using such variational methods. Some local optimality conditions are\nderived for two different settings, providing preliminary theoretical support\nfor the well-posedness of the learning problem under appropriate conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 10:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The problem becomes non-trivial when the agents have\ndifferent valuations for different parts of the cake (i.e. one agent may like\nchocolate while the other may like cream). A fair division of the cake is one\nthat takes into account the individual valuations of agents and partitions the\ncake based on some fairness criterion. Fair division may be accomplished in a\ndistributed or centralized way. Due to its natural and practical appeal, it has\nbeen a subject of study in economics. To best of our knowledge the role of\npartial information in fair division has not been studied so far from an\ninformation theoretic perspective. In this paper we study two important\nalgorithms in fair division, namely \"divide and choose\" and \"adjusted winner\"\nfor the case of two agents. We quantify the benefit of negotiation in the\ndivide and choose algorithm, and its use in tricking the adjusted winner\nalgorithm. Also we analyze the role of implicit information transmission\nthrough actions for the repeated divide and choose problem by finding a\ntrembling hand perfect equilibrium for an specific setup. Lastly we consider a\ncentralized algorithm for maximizing the overall welfare of the agents under\nthe Nash collective utility function (CUF).

The users (sink\nnodes) demand different number of descriptions over links with different packet\nloss rates. The three coded schemes are based on the LT codes, growth codes,\nand randomized chunked codes. The schemes are compared on the basis of the\ntotal number of transmissions required to deliver the demands of all users,\nwhich we refer to as the server (source) delivery time. We design the degree\ndistributions of LT codes by solving suitably defined linear optimization\nproblems, and numerically characterize the achievable delivery time for\ndifferent coding schemes. We find that including a systematic phase (uncoded\ntransmission) is significantly beneficial for scenarios with low demands, and\nthat coding is necessary for efficiently delivering high demands. Different\ndemand and error rate scenarios may require very different coding schemes.\nGrowth codes and chunked codes do not perform as well as optimized LT codes in\nthe heterogeneous communication scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 14:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-22"}

It consists in\nexploring the iterative and recursive structures of loops to redistribute\ncomputation nodes on cycle periods, and thus to achieve full parallelism.\nHowever, this technique introduces a large overhead in a loop generation due to\nthe loop transformation. The provided solutions are generally characterized by\nan important cycle number and a great code size. It represents the most\nlimiting factors while implementing them in embedded systems. In this paper, we\npresent a new Multidimensional Retiming technique, called \"Optimal\nMultidimensional Retiming\" (OMDR). It reveals the timing and data dependency\ncharacteristics of nodes, to minimize the overhead. The experimental results\nshow that the average improvement on the execution time of the nested loops by\nour technique is 19.31% compared to the experiments provided by an existent\nMultidimensional Retiming Technique. The average code size is reduced by 43.53%\ncompared to previous experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 22:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-22"}
