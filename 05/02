Local availability of mathematics\nassigns separate mathematical universes, U_{x}, to each space time point, x.\nThe mathematics available to an observer, O_{x}, at x is contained in U_{x}.\nNumber scaling is based on extending the choice freedom of vector space bases\nin gauge theories to choice freedom of underlying number systems. Scaling\narises in the description, in U_{x}, of mathematical systems in U_{y}. If a_{y}\nor \\psi_{y} is a number or a quantum state in U_{y}, then the corresponding\nnumber or state in U_{x} is r_{y,x}a_{x} or r_{y,x}\\psi_{x}. Here a_{x} and\n\\psi_{x} are the same number and state in U_{x} as a_{y} and \\psi_{y} are in\nU_{y}. If y=x+\\hat{\\mu}dx is a neighbor point of x, then the scaling factor is\nr_{y,x}=\\exp(\\vec{A}(x)\\cdot\\hat{\\mu}dx) where \\vec{A} is a vector field,\nassumed here to be the gradient of a scalar field. The effects of scaling and\nlocal availability of mathematics on quantum theory show that scaling has two\ncomponents, external and internal. External scaling is shown above for a_{y}\nand \\psi_{y}. Internal scaling occurs in expressions with integrals or\nderivatives over space or space time. An example is the replacement of the\nposition expectation value, \\int\\psi^{*}(y)y\\psi(y)dy, by\n\\int_{x}r_{y,x}\\psi^{*}_{x}(y_{x})y_{x}\\psi_{x}(y_{x})dy_{x}. This is an\nintegral in U_{x}. The good agreement between quantum theory and experiment\nshows that scaling is negligible in a space region, L, in which experiments and\ncalculations can be done, and results compared. L includes the solar system,\nbut the speed of light limits the size of L to a few light years. Outside of\n$L$, at cosmological distances, the limits on scaling are not present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 16:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We argue this does not necessarily imply that baryons lose this\nmuch specific angular momentum as they form galaxies.

Namely, we determine the\ndensity contrast Delta, with respect to the critical density of the Universe,\nby which dark matter haloes need to be defined in order to have the same\naverage specific angular momentum as the galaxies they host. Under the\nassumption that galaxies are related to haloes via their characteristic\nrotation velocities, the necessary Delta is ~600. This Delta corresponds to an\naverage halo radius and mass which are ~60% and ~75%, respectively, of the\nvirial values (i.e., for Delta = 200). We refer to this radius as the radius of\nbaryonic collapse R_BC, since if specific angular momentum is conserved\nperfectly, baryons would come from within it. It is not likely a simple step\nfunction due to the complex gastrophysics involved, therefore we regard it as\nan effective radius. In summary, the difference between the predicted initial\nand the observed final specific angular momentum of galaxies, which is\nconventionally attributed solely to angular momentum loss, can more naturally\nbe explained by a preference for collapse of baryons within R_BC, with possibly\nsome later angular momentum transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 20:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Assuming radio power is a proxy for jet power, we\ncan say that the jet is continuously present in the hard state and undetectable\n(and therefore weaker) in the soft state. Since the different accretion states\nare also generally assumed to be associated with different disc geometries --\nthe hard state with a hot, thick flow, and the soft state with a cold, thin\ndisc -- we investigate the possibility that these two phenomena are linked;\ni.e., that the difference in disc geometry is the cause of the difference in\nobserved jet power. We do this by comparing various measures of jet power in\nnumerical simulations of accretion discs of differing temperatures and\nthicknesses. We perform these simulations using the general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic code Cosmos++ and a newly added cooling function, which\nallows us to regulate the disc scale height H/r at different radii. We find no\napparent correlation between the disc scale height and jet power whenever we\nnormalize the latter by the mass accretion history of each simulation. We\nattribute this result to the role that the \"corona\" plays in confining and\naccelerating the jet (our corona may also be considered a failed MHD \"wind\").\nThe properties of the corona do not vary significantly from one simulation to\nanother, even though the scale heights of the discs vary by up to a factor of\nfour. If this holds true in nature, then it suggests that the correlation\nbetween spectral state and jet power must be attributable to some other\nproperty, possibly the topology of the magnetic field. Alternatively, it could\nbe that the corona disappears altogether in the soft state, which would be\nconsistent with observations, but has so far not been seen in simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 20:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 14:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\npresented self-consistent macroscopic theory of this process employs\nthermodynamics (classical, statistical and linear non-equilibrium),\nhydrodynamics and interfacial kinetics. As a result of thermodynamic study of\nthe problem, the work of formation of a bubble is obtained and parameters of\nthe critical bubble are determined. The variables V (the bubble volume), \\rho\n(the vapor density), and T (the vapor temperature) are shown to be natural for\nthe given task. An algorithm of writing the equations of motion of a bubble in\nthe space {V, \\rho, T} - equations for V, \\rho, and T - is offered. This\nalgorithm ensures symmetry of the matrix of kinetic coefficients. The equation\nfor written on the basis of this algorithm is shown to represent the first law\nof thermodynamics for a bubble. The negative eigenvalue of the motion equations\nwhich alongside with the work of the critical bubble formation determines the\nstationary nucleation rate of bubbles is obtained. Various kinetic limits are\nconsidered. One of the kinetic constraints leads to the fact that the\nnucleation cannot occur in the whole metastable region; it occurs only in some\nsubregion of the latter. Zeldovich theory of cavitation is shown to be a\nlimiting case of the theory presented. The limiting effects of various kinetic\nprocesses on the nucleation rate of bubbles are shown analytically. These are\nthe inertial motion of a liquid as well as the processes of particles exchange\nand heat exchange between a bubble and surrounding liquid.

We\nfit GRAMS models to ~30,000 Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Red Supergiant\n(RSG) stars in the LMC, using 12 bands of photometry from the optical to the\nmid-infrared. Our published dataset consists of thousands of evolved stars with\nindividually determined evolutionary parameters such as luminosity and\nmass-loss rate. The GRAMS grid has a greater than 80% accuracy rate\ndiscriminating between Oxygen- and Carbon-rich chemistry. The global dust\ninjection rate to the interstellar medium (ISM) of the LMC from RSGs and AGB\nstars is on the order of 1.5x10^(-5) solar masses/yr, equivalent to a total\nmass injection rate (including the gas) into the ISM of ~5x10^(-3) solar\nmasses/yr. Carbon stars inject two and a half times as much dust into the ISM\nas do O-rich AGB stars, but the same amount of mass.

This theory reduces to thermal pure gauge theory as m->infinity and to\ncircle-compactified (non-thermal) supersymmetric gluodynamics in the limit\nm->0. In the m-L plane, there is a line of center symmetry changing phase\ntransitions. In the limit m->infinity, this transition takes place at\nL_c=1/T_c, where T_c is the critical temperature of the deconfinement\ntransition in pure Yang-Mills theory. We show that near m=0, the critical\ncompactification scale L_c can be computed using semi-classical methods and\nthat the transition is of second order. This suggests that the deconfining\nphase transition in pure Yang-Mills theory is continuously connected to a\ntransition that can be studied at weak coupling. The center symmetry changing\nphase transition arises from the competition of perturbative contributions and\nmonopole-instantons that destabilize the center, and topological molecules\n(neutral bions) that stabilize the center. The contribution of molecules can be\ncomputed using supersymmetry in the limit m=0, and via the\nBogomolnyi--Zinn-Justin (BZJ) prescription in the non-supersymmetric gauge\ntheory.

We explain why the non-cancellation\nis required for consistency with holomorphy and supersymmetry and perform an\nexplicit calculation of the one-loop determinant ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 May 2012 23:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 16:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

On the other hand, the quantum state space calls for a\nnon-local description of multi-particle states. This article uses a\nbehavioristic approach to argue, that an observer in a universe like this has\nto rely on local interactions to learn about its properties and behavior. Such\nan observer is fundamentally restricted in his ability to understand and\nstructurally reconstruct the individual local physical universe. We argue, that\nthis reconstruction based on dynamically available information is the defining\nprocess of observation in quantum theory. The observer-centric view of the\nglobal quantum dynamics is shown to be non-unitary and non-linear in general,\neven if the universe itself evolves unitarily. Interactions with massless free\nparticles are found to have great influence on observation, because of their\nspecial role in the light-cone structure of an Einstein-local universe. For a\nspecific scattering process with a photon of unknown state, the observed\noutcome can be subjectively random and follow the Born statistic, while the\noutput state is really determined by the photon polarization.

It is\nimportant to study satellite formation in circumplanetary disks, which is often\nviewed as analogous to formation of rocky planets in protoplanetary disks. We\ninvestigated satellite formation from satellitesimals around giant planets\nthrough N-body simulations that include gravitational interactions with a\ncircumplanetary gas disk. Our main aim is to reproduce the observable\nproperties of the Galilean satellites around Jupiter through numerical\nsimulations, as previous N-body simulations have not explained the origin of\nthe resonant configuration. We performed accretion simulations based on the\nwork of Sasaki et al. (2010), in which an inner cavity is added to the model of\nCanup & Ward (2002, 2006). We found that several satellites are formed and\ncaptured in mutual mean motion resonances outside the disk inner edge and are\nstable after rapid disk gas dissipation, which explains the characteristics of\nthe Galilean satellites. In addition, owing to the existence of the disk edge,\na radial compositional gradient of the Galilean satellites can also be\nreproduced. An additional objective of this study is to discuss orbital\nproperties of formed satellites for a wide range of conditions by considering\nlarge uncertainties in model parameters. Through numerical experiments and\nsemianalytical arguments, we determined that if the inner edge of a disk is\nintroduced, a Galilean-like configuration in which several satellites are\ncaptured into a 2:1 resonance outside the disk inner cavity is almost\nuniversal. In fact, such a configuration is produced even for a massive disk\nand rapid type I migration. This result implies the inevitability of a Galilean\nsatellite formation in addition to providing theoretical predictions for\nextrasolar satellites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 01:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Poincare-Hopf tells\nthat for any injective function f on V the sum of i(f,x) is X(G). We also know\nthat averaging the indices E[i(f,x)] over all functions gives curvature K(x).\n  We explore here the situation when G is geometric of dimension d: that is if\neach unit sphere S(x) is geometric of dimension d-1 and that X(S(x))=0 for even\nd and X(S(x))=2 for odd d. The dimension of G is inductively defined as the\naverage of 1+dim(S(x)) over all S(x) assuming the empty graph has dimension -1.\n  We prove that any odd dimensional geometric graph G has zero curvature. This\nis done with the help of an index formula j(f,x) = 1-X(S(x))/2-X(B(f,x))/2,\nwhere j(x)=[i(f,x)+i(-f,x)]/2. The graph B(f,x) is the discrete level surface\n{y | f(y) = f(x)} intersected with S(x). It is a subgraph of the line graph of\nG and geometric if G is geometric.\n  The index formula simplifies for geometric graphs: for even d it is j(f,x) =\n1-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is a (d-2)-dimensional graph.

At large\nelongations from the Sun, the white-light brightness depends on both the local\nelectron density and the efficiency of the Thomson-scattering process. To\nquantify the effects of the Thomson-scattering geometry, we study an\ninterplanetary shock using forward magnetohydrodynamic simulation and synthetic\nwhite-light imaging. Identifiable as an inclined streak of enhanced brightness\nin a time-elongation map, the travelling shock can be readily imaged by an\nobserver located within a wide range of longitudes in the ecliptic. Different\nparts of the shock front contribute to the imaged brightness pattern viewed by\nobservers at different longitudes. Moreover, even for an observer located at a\nfixed longitude, a different part of the shock front will contribute to the\nimaged brightness at any given time. The observed brightness within each\nimaging pixel results from a weighted integral along its corresponding\nray-path. It is possible to infer the longitudinal location of the shock from\nthe brightness pattern in an optical sky map, based on the east-west asymmetry\nin its brightness and degree of polarization. Therefore, measurement of the\ninterplanetary polarized brightness could significantly reduce the ambiguity in\nperforming three-dimensional reconstruction of local electron density from\nwhite-light imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 08:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-16"}

The well-sampled data set on SN\n2009kn offers the possibility to test these models, in the case of both SN\n2009kn and SN 1994W.

The correspondence between\ninfinitary term rewriting and term graph rewriting has been studied to some\nextent. However, this endeavour is impaired by the lack of an appropriate\ncounterpart of infinitary rewriting on the side of term graphs. We aim to fill\nthis gap by devising two modes of convergence based on a partial order\nrespectively a metric on term graphs. The thus obtained structures generalise\ncorresponding modes of convergence that are usually studied in infinitary term\nrewriting. We argue that this yields a common framework in which both term\nrewriting and term graph rewriting can be studied. In order to substantiate our\nclaim, we compare convergence on term graphs and on terms. In particular, we\nshow that the modes of convergence on term graphs are conservative extensions\nof the corresponding modes of convergence on terms and are preserved under\nunravelling term graphs to terms.

This is done by implementing\na model independent and bias-free reconstruction of the various scales and\ndistances that characterize the data, like the luminosity $d_L(z)$ and the\nangular diameter distance $d_A(z)$ in the SnIa and BAO data, respectively, or\nthe dependence with redshift of the matter density $\\om_m(a)$ in the growth\nrate data, $f\\sigma_8(z)$. These quantities can then be used to reconstruct the\nexpansion history of the Universe, and the resulting Dark Energy (DE) equation\nof state $w(z)$ in the context of FRW models, or the mass radial function\n$\\om_M(r)$ in LTB models. In this way, the reconstruction is completely\nindependent of our prior bias. Furthermore, we use this method to test the\nEtherington relation, ie the well-known relation between the luminosity and the\nangular diameter distance, $\\eta \\equiv \\frac{d_L(z)}{(1+z)^2 d_A(z)}$, which\nis equal to 1 in metric theories of gravity. We find that the present data seem\nto suggest a 3-$\\sigma$ deviation from one at redshifts $z\\sim 0.5$.

To date, the properties of the bump\nhave been examined in only two GRB afterglows (GRB 070802 and GRB 080607). In\nthis work we analyse in detail the detections of the 2175 extinction bump in\nthe optical spectra of the two further GRB afterglows: GRB 080605 and 080805.\nWe gather all available optical/NIR photometric, spectroscopic and X-ray data\nto construct multi-epoch SEDs for both GRB afterglows. We fit the SEDs with the\nFitzpatrick & Massa (1990) model with a single or broken PL. We also fit a\nsample of 38 GRB afterglows, known to prefer a SMC-type extinction curve, with\nthe same model. We find that the SEDs of GRB 080605 and GRB 080805 at two\nepochs are fit well with a single PL with a derived extinction of A_V =\n0.52(+0.13 -0.16) and 0.50 (+0.13 -0.10), and 2.1(+0.7-0.6) and 1.5+/-0.2\nrespectively. While the slope of the extinction curve of GRB 080805 is not\nwell-constrained, the extinction curve of GRB 080605 has an unusual very steep\nfar-UV rise together with the 2175 bump. Such an extinction curve has\npreviously been found in only a small handful of sightlines in the MW. One\npossible explanation of such an extinction curve may be dust arising from two\ndifferent regions with two separate grain populations, however we cannot\ndistinguish the origin of the curve. We finally compare the four 2175 bump\nsightlines to the larger GRB afterglow sample and to Local Group sightlines. We\nfind that while the width and central positions of the bumps are consistent\nwith what is observed in the Local Group, the relative strength of the detected\nbump (A_bump) for GRB afterglows is weaker for a given A_V than for almost any\nLocal Group sightline. Such dilution of the bump strength may offer tentative\nsupport to a dual dust-population scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 11:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-18"}

The reason is that stellar winds have\nbeen found to be clumped, which results in the reduction of unclumped empirical\nmass-loss rates. Most stellar evolution models employ theoretical mass-loss\nrates which are already reduced by a moderate factor of ~2-3 compared to\nnon-corrected empirical rates. A key question is whether these reduced rates\nare of the correct order of magnitude, or if they should be reduced even\nfurther, which would mean that the alternative of eruptive mass loss becomes\nnecessary. Here we introduce the transition mass-loss rate (dM/dt)_trans\nbetween O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Its novelty is that it is model\nindependent. All that is required is postulating the spectroscopic transition\npoint in a given data-set, and determining the stellar luminosity, which is far\nless model dependent than the mass-loss rate. The transition mass-loss rate is\nsubsequently used to calibrate stellar wind strength by its application to the\nOf/WNh stars in the Arches cluster. Good agreement is found with two\nalternative modelling/theoretical results, suggesting that the rates provided\nby current theoretical models are of the right order of magnitude in the\n~50Msun mass range. Our results do not confirm the specific need for eruptive\nmass loss as Luminous Blue Variables, and current stellar evolution modelling\nfor Galactic massive stars seems sound. Mass loss through alternative\nmechanisms might still become necessary at lower masses, and/or metallicities,\nand the quantification of alternative mass loss is desirable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 11:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The expectation values of the radial (real) fields are in fact to be\ninterpreted as the density of empty or singly occupied sites. Whereas the\nradial representation of the Barnes slave bosons has been investigated before,\na setup for the functional integral of radial bosonic fields in the more\nphysical Kotliar-Ruckenstein representation has not been accomplished to date.\nWe implement a path integral procedure with suitable renormalization factors\nfor a strongly correlated two-site model which allows to control the formal\nsteps in the intricate evaluation, as the results for the partition function\nand the expectation values are known from exact diagonalization for such a\nminimal single impurity Anderson model. The partition function is shown to be a\ntrace over a product of matrices local in time and therefore can be calculated\nanalytically.

The thermal emission of the debris was\nmodelled and coupled to a time-dependent description of their expansion after\nthe outburst. The analysis was performed in the Fourier plane. Visibilities\nwere computed for the two observing dates and compared to the data to measure\ntheir velocity and mass. Optical data and 250-GHz continuum measurements\npublished in the literature were used to further constrain the dust kinematics\nand size distribution. Two distinct dust components in terms of kinematic\nproperties are identified in the data.

Enmeshed queries are continuous, but\nnew queries (and not data) answer older queries; the variable group size also\nmakes enmeshed queries different from entangled queries, publish-subscribe\nsystems, and dating services.\n  We show that even offline group coordination using enmeshed queries is\nNP-hard.

This\nconstruction was also used very efficiently in a powerful aerial target\ntracking algorithm by Mujica et al.\\cite{Mujica99,Mujica2000}. In the last\ndecade, this tool was proposed as an elegant and efficient alternative\nframework to the Optical Flow (OF), the Block Matching (BM) or the phase\ndifference, for the study of motion estimation in image sequences.\nNevertheless, the aperture selectivity of the 2D+T Morlet wavelet presents some\ndifficulties. Here we propose to replace the 2D Morlet wavelet by a\nGaussian-Conical (GC) wavelet for the spatial part of the spatio-temporal\nwavelet, since the GC wavelet has a better aperture selectivity and allows a\nvery simple adjustment of the aperture. Therefore we build a new, highly\ndirectional, speed-tuned wavelet called Gaussian-Conical-Morlet (GCM) wavelet.\nLike the speed-tuned 2D+T Morlet, the new wavelet presents very good\ncharacteristics in motion estimation and tracking, namely long temporal\ndependence, robustness to noise and to occlusions, and supersedes the OF\n(Optical Flow) and BM (Block Matching) techniques. However, for aperture\nselectivity, directional speed-capture and spectral recognition and tracking,\nGCM easily outperforms Morlet. This paper describes the GCM construction,\nutilization and aperture performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 14:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-12"}

Using generalized Taylor dispersion theory, we develop a\npopulation-level swimming-advection-diffusion model for suspensions of\nmicro-organisms in a vertical pipe flow. In particular, a combination of\ngravitational and viscous torques acting on individual cells can affect their\nswimming behaviour, which is termed gyrotaxis. This typically leads to local\ncell drift and diffusion in a suspension of cells. In a flow in a pipe, small\namounts of radial drift across streamlines can have a major impact on the\neffective axial drift and diffusion of the cells. We present a Galerkin method\nto calculate the local mean swimming velocity and diffusion tensor based on\nlocal shear for arbitrary flow rates. This method is validated with asymptotic\nresults obtained in the limits of weak and strong shear. We solve the resultant\nswimming-advection-diffusion equation using numerical methods for the case of\nimposed Poiseuille flow and investigate how the flow modifies the dispersion of\nactive swimmers from that of passive scalars. We establish that generalized\nTaylor dispersion theory predicts an enhancement of gyrotactic focussing in\npipe flow with increasing shear strength, in contrast to earlier models. We\nalso show that biased swimming cells may behave very differently to passive\ntracers, drifting axially at up to twice the rate and diffusing much less.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 15:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-28"}

While the simple\n\"{\\tau}-parametrization\" of the reionization process and, in particular, of its\nimprints on the CMB anisotropy likely represents a sufficiently accurate\nmodelling for the interpretation of current CMB data, a great attention has\nbeen recently posed on the accurate computation of the reionization signatures\nin the CMB for a large variety of astrophysical scenarios and physical\nprocesses.

We have implemented a modified version of CAMB, the Cosmological\nBoltzmann code for computing the angular power spectrum (APS) of the\nanisotropies of the CMB, to introduce the hydrogen and helium ionization\nfractions predicted in astrophysical and phenomenological reionization\nhistories, beyond the simple {\\tau}-parametrization.

The\nfeedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of cloud-dispersal generated by\nthe jet-ISM interactions, is sensitive to the maximum size of clouds in the\nfractal cloud distribution but not to their volume filling factor. Feedback\nceases to be efficient for Eddington ratios P_jet/L_edd<10^-4, although systems\nwith large cloud complexes ~50 pc require jets of Eddington ratio in excess of\n10^-2 to disperse the clouds appreciably. Based on measurements of the bubble\nexpansion rates in our simulations we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions\nresulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations without a\nmulti-phase treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume filling\nfactor of warm phase material is less than 0.1 and the cloud complexes are\nsmaller than ~25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the dense embedded clouds\nis provided by the ram pressure of the high velocity flow through the porous\nchannels of the warm phase, flow that has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase\ngas it has swept up, and is additionally mass-loaded by ablated cloud material.\nThis mechanism transfers 10% to 40% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas,\naccelerating it within 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match those observed in\na range of high and low redshift radio galaxies hosting powerful radio jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 00:36:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 13:09:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 02:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this\npaper, we present the Gaussian beam method for the Dirac equation. With the\nhelp of an eigenvalue decomposition, the Gaussian beams can be independently\nevolved along each eigenspace and summed to construct an approximate solution\nof the Dirac equation. Moreover, the proposed Eulerian Gaussian beam keeps the\nadvantages of constructing the Hessian matrices by simply using level set\nfunctions' derivatives. Finally, several numerical examples show the efficiency\nand accuracy of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 11:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-04"}
