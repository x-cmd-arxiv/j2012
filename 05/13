When the population\nhas group structure, as is often found in social networks, players in\nexperiments are considered to show behavior that deviates from existing\ntheoretical models of indirect reciprocity. First, players often show ingroup\nfavoritism (i.e., cooperation only within the group) rather than full\ncooperation (i.e., cooperation within and across groups), even though the\nlatter is Pareto efficient. Second, in general, humans approximate outgroup\nmembers' personal characteristics, presumably including the reputation used for\nindirect reciprocity, by a single value attached to the group. Humans use such\na stereotypic approximation, a phenomenon known as outgroup homogeneity in\nsocial psychology. I propose a model of indirect reciprocity in populations\nwith group structure to examine the possibility of ingroup favoritism and full\ncooperation. In accordance with outgroup homogeneity, I assume that players\napproximate outgroup members' personal reputations by a single reputation value\nattached to the group. I show that ingroup favoritism and full cooperation are\nstable under different social norms (i.e., rules for assigning reputations)\nsuch that they do not coexist in a single model. If players are forced to\nconsistently use the same social norm for assessing different types of\ninteractions (i.e., ingroup versus outgroup interactions), only full\ncooperation survives. The discovered mechanism is distinct from any form of\ngroup selection. The results also suggest potential methods for reducing\ningroup bias to shift the equilibrium from ingroup favoritism to full\ncooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 May 2012 03:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 22:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}

It is necessary\nto understand how such biases affect algal dispersion in natural and industrial\nflows, especially in view of growing interest in algal photobioreactors.\nMotivated by this, we here study the dispersion of gyrotactic algae in laminar\nand turbulent channel flows using direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the\nanalytical swimming dispersion theory of Bees and Croze (2010). Time-resolved\ndispersion measures are evaluated as functions of the Peclet and Reynolds\nnumbers in upwelling and downwelling flows. For laminar flows, DNS results are\ncompared with theory using competing descriptions of biased swimming cells in\nshear flow. Excellent agreement is found for predictions that employ\ngeneralized-Taylor-dispersion. The results highlight peculiarities of\ngyrotactic swimmer dispersion relative to passive tracers. In laminar\ndownwelling flow the cell distribution drifts in excess of the mean flow,\nincreasing in magnitude with Peclet number. The cell effective axial\ndiffusivity increases and decreases with Peclet number (for tracers it merely\nincreases).

Although the\ncharges are distributed heterogeneously on the surface, most of the theoretical\nmodels treat them as homogeneous. For overall non-neutral surfaces, the\nassumption of surface charge homogeneity is rather reasonable, since the\nleading terms of two such interacting surfaces depend on the non-zero average\ncharge. However, for overall neutral surfaces, the nature of the surface charge\ndistribution is crucial in determining the inter-surface interaction. In the\npresent work we study the interaction between two charged surfaces across an\naqueous solution for several charge distributions. The analysis is preformed\nwithin the framework of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann theory. For periodic\ncharge distributions the interaction is found to be repulsive at small\nseparations, unless the two surface distributions are completely out-of-phase\nwith respect to each other. For quenched random charge distributions we find\nthat due to the presence of the ionic solution in between the surfaces, the\ninter-surface repulsion dominates over the attraction in the linear regime of\nthe Poisson-Boltzmann theory.

This process occurs in the\nradiation-pressure dominated early Universe, when the primordial perturbations\nexcite standing sound waves on entering the sound horizon. Photons from\ndifferent phases of the sound waves, having different temperatures, diffuse\nthrough the electron-baryon plasma and mix together. This diffusion, with the\nlength defined by Thomson scattering, dissipates sound waves and creates\nspectral distortions in the CMB. Of the total dissipated energy, 2/3 raises the\naverage temperature of the blackbody part of spectrum, while 1/3 creates a\ndistortion of y-type. It is well known that at redshifts 10^5< z< 2x10^6,\ncomptonization rapidly transforms y-distortions into a Bose-Einstein spectrum.\nThe chemical potential of the Bose-Einstein spectrum is again 1/3 the value we\nwould get if all the dissipated energy was injected into a blackbody spectrum\nbut no extra photons were added. We study the mixing of blackbody spectra,\nemphasizing the thermodynamic point of view, and identifying spectral\ndistortions with entropy creation. This allows us to obtain the main results\nconnected with the dissipation of sound waves in the early Universe in a very\nsimple way.
