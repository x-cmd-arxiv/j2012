The equations of general\nrelativistic hydrodynamics are solved using high resolution shock capturing\nmethods. In this treatment we consider the ultrarelativistic limit wherein one\nmay neglect the baryon rest mass density. This approximation is valid in the\nregime where the internal energy of the system dominates over the rest mass\nenergy contribution from the baryons. The parameters of interest in this study\nare the adiabatic constant $\\Gamma$, and the asymptotic speed of the fluid,\n$v_\\infty$. We perform our simulations in three different regimes, subsonic,\nmarginally supersonic, and supersonic, but the primary focus of this study is\nthe parameter regime in which the flow is supersonic, that is when $v_\\infty\n\\ge c_{s}^{\\infty}$. As expected from previous studies the supersonic regimes\nreveal interesting dynamics, but even more interesting is the presence of a bow\nshock in marginally supersonic systems. A range of parameter values were\ninvestigated to attempt to capture possible deviations from steady state\nsolutions, none were found. To show the steady state behaviour of each of the\nflows studied we calculate the energy accretion rates on the Schwarzschild\nradius. Additionally, we also find that the accretion flows are dependent on\nthe location of the computational boundary, that if the computational boundary\nis located too close to the black hole the calculated flow profiles are marred\nwith numerical artifacts.

Large warps\nenhance memory coalescing significantly but also increase branch divergence.\nThis leaves designers with two choices: use a small warps and invest in finding\nnew solutions to enhance coalescing or use large warps and address branch\ndivergence employing effective control-flow solutions. In this work our goal is\nto investigate the answer to this question. We analyze warp size impact on\nmemory coalescing and branch divergence.

Through\nquorum sensing, each bacterium performs sensing the medium and communicating it\nto others via molecular communication. As a result, bacteria can orchestrate\nand act collectively and perform tasks impossible otherwise. In this paper, we\nconsider a population of bacteria as a single node in a network. In our version\nof biological communication networks, such a node would communicate with one\nanother via molecular signals. As a first step toward such networks, this paper\nfocuses on the study of the transfer of information to the population (i.e.,\nthe node) by stimulating it with a concentration of special type of a molecules\nsignal. These molecules trigger a chain of processes inside each bacteria that\nresults in a final output in the form of light or fluorescence. Each stage in\nthe process adds noise to the signal carried to the next stage. Our objective\nis to measure (compute) the maximum amount of information that we can transfer\nto the node. This can be viewed as the collective sensing capacity of the node.\nThe molecular concentration, which carries the information, is the input to the\nnode, which should be estimated by observing the produced light as the output\nof the node (i.e., the entire population of bacteria forming the node). We\nfocus on the noise caused by the random process of trapping molecules at the\nreceptors as well as the variation of outputs of different bacteria in the\nnode. The capacity variation with the number of bacteria in the node and the\nnumber of receptors per bacteria is obtained. Finally, we investigated the\ncollective sensing capability of the node when a specific form of molecular\nsignaling concentration is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 17:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-23"}

In bulk polycrystalline\nform, Ti3SiC2 has a virtually zero Seebeck coefficient over a wide temperature\nrange. In contrast, we find that the in-plane (basal ab) Seebeck coefficient of\nTi3SiC2, measured on single-crystal films has a substantial and positive value\nof 4-6 muV/K.

They dominate the interface between the chromosphere and\ncorona and may provide significant mass and energy to the corona. We use\nhigh-quality observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope to establish\nthat so-called type II spicules are characterized by the simultaneous action of\nthree different types of motion: 1. field-aligned flows of order 50-100 km/s,\n2. swaying motions of order 15-20 km/s, and 3. torsional motions of order 25-30\nkm/s. The first two modes have been studied in detail before, but not the\ntorsional motions. Our analysis of many near-limb and off-limb spectra and\nnarrow-band images yields strong evidence that most, if not all, type-II\nspicules undergo large torsional modulation and that these motions, like\nspicule swaying, represent Alfvenic waves propagating outward at several\nhundred km/s. The combined action of the different motions explains the similar\nmorphology of spicule bushes in the outer red and blue wings of chromospheric\nlines, and needs to be taken into account when interpreting Doppler motions to\nderive estimates for field-aligned flows in spicules and determining the\nAlfvenic wave energy in the solar atmosphere. Our results also suggest that\nlarge torsional motion is an ingredient in the production of type-II spicules\nand that spicules play an important role in the transport of helicity through\nthe solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 19:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The PAMELA experiment\nis a satellite-borne apparatus which allows different cosmic ray species to be\nidentified over background. Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton flux and\nthe antiproton-to-proton flux ratio from 1.5 GeV to 180 GeV are presented in\nthis thesis. Compared to previous experiments, PAMELA extends the energy range\nof antiproton measurements and provides significantly higher statistics. The\nderived antiproton flux and antiproton-to-proton flux ratio are consistent with\nprevious measurements and generally considered to be produced as secondary\nproducts when cosmic ray protons and helium nuclei interact with the\ninterstellar medium.\n  To constrain cosmic ray acceleration and propagation models, the antiproton\ndata measured by PAMELA were further used together with the proton spectrum\nreported by PAMELA, as well as the B/C data provided by other experiments.\nStatistical tools were interfaced with the cosmic ray propagation package\nGALPROP to perform the constraining analyses.

We explore general properties of circumbinary disks by reformulating\nstandard equations for the viscous disk evolution in terms of the viscous\nangular momentum flux F_J. In steady state F_J is a linear function of the\nspecific angular momentum, which is a generalization of (but is not equivalent\nto) the standard constant \\dot M disk solution. If the torque produced by the\ncentral binary is effective at stopping gas inflow and opening a gap (or\ncavity) in the disk, then the inner part of the circumbinary disk can be\napproximated as a constant F_J disk. We compute properties of such disks in\ndifferent physical regimes relevant for SMBH binaries and use these results to\nunderstand the gas-assisted evolution of SMBH pairs starting at separations\n10^{-4}-10^{-2} pc. We find the following. (1) Pile-up of matter at the inner\nedge of the disk leads to continuous growth of the torque acting on the binary\nand can considerably accelerate its orbital evolution compared to the\ngravitational wave-driven decay. (2) Torque on the binary is determined\nnon-locally and does not in general reflect the disk properties in the vicinity\nof the binary. (3) Binary evolution depends on the past history of the disk\nevolution.

We use a global\nclimate model to simulate the thermal phase variations of Earth-analogs and\ntest whether these data could distinguish between planets with different heat\nstorage and heat transport characteristics. In particular, we consider a\ntemperate climate with polar ice caps (like modern Earth), and a snowball state\nwhere the oceans are globally covered in ice. We first quantitatively study the\nperiodic radiative forcing from, and climatic response to, rotation, obliquity,\nand eccentricity. Orbital eccentricity and seasonal changes in albedo cause\nvariations in the global-mean absorbed flux. The responses of the two climates\nto these global seasons indicate that the temperate planet has 3 times the bulk\nheat capacity of the snowball planet due to the presence of liquid water\noceans. The temperate obliquity seasons are weaker than one would expect based\non thermal inertia alone; this is due to cross-equatorial oceanic and\natmospheric energy transport. Thermal inertia and cross-equatorial heat\ntransport have qualitatively different effects on obliquity seasons, insofar as\nheat transport tends to reduce seasonal amplitude without inducing a phase lag.\nFor an Earth-like planet, however, this effect is masked by the mixing of\nsignals from low thermal inertia regions (sea ice and land) with that from high\nthermal inertia regions (oceans), which also produces a damped response with\nsmall phase lag. We then simulate thermal lightcurves as they would appear to a\nhigh-contrast imaging mission (TPF-I/Darwin) and consider the inverse problem\nof estimating thermal inertia based solely on time-resolved photometry.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 14:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However,\nsmaller particles are difficult to filter by a planet-induced gap due to 1)\ndust diffusion, and 2) a high gas accretion velocity at the gap edge. An\nanalytic model is also derived to understand what size particles can be\nfiltered by the gap edge. Finally, with our updated understanding of dust\nfiltration, we have computed Monte-Carlo radiative transfer models with\nvariable dust size distributions to generate the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of disks with gaps. By comparing with transitional disk observations\n(e.g. GM Aur), we have found that dust filtration alone has difficulties to\ndeplete small particles sufficiently to explain the near-IR deficit of\ntransitional disks, except under some extreme circumstances. The scenario of\ngap opening by multiple planets studied previously suffers the same difficulty.\nOne possible solution is by invoking both dust filtration and dust growth in\nthe inner disk. In this scenario, a planet induced gap filters large dust\nparticles in the disk, and the remaining small dust particles passing to the\ninner disk can grow efficiently without replenishment from fragmentation of\nlarge grains. Predictions for ALMA have also been made based on all these\nscenarios.

The lack of high precision radial\nvelocity (RV) data stresses the need for precise light curve analysis and\ngathering further RV data. By using available photometric and RV data, we\nperform a blend analysis, compute more accurate system parameters, confine the\nplanetary mass and attempt to cast light on the observed transit anomalies. We\ncombine the original HATNet observations and various followup data to jointly\nanalyze the signal content and extract the transit component and use our RV\ndata to aid the global parameter determination. The blend analysis of the\ncombination of multicolor light curves yields the first independent\nconfirmation of the planetary nature of WASP-33b. We clearly identify three\nfrequency components in the 15-21 1/day regime with amplitudes 7-5 mmag. These\nfrequencies correspond to the delta Scuti-type pulsation of the host star. None\nof these pulsation frequencies or their low-order linear combinations are in\nclose resonance with the orbital frequency. We show that these pulsation\ncomponents explain some but not all of the observed transit anomalies. The\ngrand-averaged transit light curve shows that there is a ~1.5 mmag brightening\nshortly after the planet passes the mid-transit phase. Although the duration\nand amplitude of this brightening varies, it is visible even through the direct\ninspections of the individual transit events (some 40-60% of the followup light\ncurves show this phenomenon). We suggest that the most likely explanation of\nthis feature is the presence of a well-populated spot belt which is highly\ninclined to the orbital plane. This geometry is consistent with the inference\nfrom the spectroscopic anomalies. Finally, we constrain the planetary mass to\nM_p=3.27+/-0.73 M_J by using our RV data collected by the TRES spectrograph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 21:07:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 22:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-15"}

The color of the other vertices is\nunobserved. Typically, the unknown total number of red vertices is small. The\nvertex nomination problem is to nominate one of the unobserved vertices as\nbeing red. The edge set of the graph is a subset of the set of unordered pairs\nof vertices. Suppose that each edge is also colored green or red and this is\nobserved for all edges. The context statistic of a vertex is defined as the\nnumber of observed red vertices connected to it, and its content statistic is\nthe number of red edges incident to it. Assuming that these statistics are\nindependent between vertices and that red edges are more likely between red\nvertices, Coppersmith and Priebe (2012) proposed a likelihood model based on\nthese statistics. Here, we formulate a Bayesian model using the proposed\nlikelihood together with prior distributions chosen for the unknown parameters\nand unobserved vertex colors. From the resulting posterior distribution, the\nnominated vertex is the one with the highest posterior probability of being\nred. Inference is conducted using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm, and\nperformance is illustrated by a simulation study. Results show that (i) the\nBayesian model performs significantly better than chance; (ii) the probability\nof correct nomination increases with increasing posterior probability that the\nnominated vertex is red; and (iii) the Bayesian model either matches or\nperforms better than the method in Coppersmith and Priebe.

Stationary\ndistributions of such models give useful information on the steady state\nperformance of the corresponding stochastic networks and thus it is important\nto develop reliable and efficient algorithms for numerical computation of such\ndistributions. In this work we propose and analyze a Monte-Carlo scheme based\non an Euler type discretization of the reflected stochastic differential\nequation using a single sequence of time discretization steps which decrease to\nzero as time approaches infinity. Appropriately weighted empirical measures\nconstructed from the simulated discretized reflected diffusion are proposed as\napproximations for the invariant probability measure of the true diffusion\nmodel. Almost sure consistency results are established that in particular show\nthat weighted averages of polynomially growing continuous functionals evaluated\non the discretized simulated system converge a.s. to the corresponding\nintegrals with respect to the invariant measure.

Our approach can be applied to non-linear dynamics as well by using\ntheir first-order Taylor approximations.

However, our rest-frame optical spectrum from MOIRCS\nshows strong [OIII] emission from the narrow-line region (NLR) suggesting that,\nat variance with the BLR, NLR gas is not metal-rich. In order to reconcile\nthese contradictory results, there may be two alternative possibilities; (1)\nthe strong nitrogen lines from the BLR are simply due to a very high relative\nabundance of nitrogen rather than to a very high BLR metallicity, or (2) the\nBLR metallicity is not representative of the metallicity of the host galaxy,\nbetter traced by the NLR. In either case, the strong broad nitrogen lines in\nthe UV spectrum are not indication of a chemically enriched host galaxy.

In this paper, their gamma-ray luminosity and\nspectral features are explained in the framework of synchrotron radiation from\nparticles located in the stripe of the pulsar wind. Apart from radiative\nlosses, particles are also subject to a constant re-acceleration and reheating\nfor instance by a magnetic reconnection induced electric field.

At\nslightly higher hole-density, nanoscale regions exhibiting pseudogap spectra\nand 180\\degree-rotational (C2v) symmetry form unidirectional clusters within\nthe C4v-symmetric matrix. Thus, hole-doping proceeds by the appearance of\nnanoscale clusters of localized holes within which the broken-symmetry\npseudogap state is stabilized.

Using data obtained with the WIRCam\nnear-infrared imager of the CFHT, we selected the AGB stars in the JHKs\ncolor-magnitude diagrams, and separated the C stars from M-giant stars in the\nJHKs color-color diagram. We identified 1,550 C stars in NGC 205 with a mean\nabsolute magnitude of M_Ks = -7.49 \\pm 0.54, and colors of (J - Ks) = 1.81 \\pm\n0.41 and (H - Ks) = 0.76 \\pm 0.24. The ratio of C stars to M-giant stars was\nestimated to be 0.15 \\pm 0.01 in NGC 205, and the local C/M ratios for the\nsouthern region are somewhat lower than those for the northern region. The (J -\nKs) color distributions of AGB stars contain the main peak of the M-giant stars\nand the red tail of the C stars. A comparison of the theoretical isochrone\nmodels with the observed color distribution indicates that most of the bright\nM-giant stars in NGC 205 were formed at log(t_yr) \\sim 9.0-9.7. The logarithmic\nslope of the M_Ks luminosity function for M-giant stars was estimated to be\n0.84 \\pm 0.01, which is comparable with dwarf elliptical galaxies NGC 147 and\nNGC 185. Furthermore, we found that the logarithmic slopes of the M_Ks\nluminosity function for C and M-giant stars are different to places, implying a\ndifferent star formation history within NGC 205.

In classical spin systems, it\nis known that the equilibrium free energy is obtained by minimizing the free\nenergy functional over the coarse-grained magnetization. Here we show that it\nis also true for quantum spin systems. From this observation, it is found that\nwhen the canonical ensemble and the microcanonical ensemble are not equivalent\nin some parameter region, it is not necessarily justified to replace the actual\nlong-range interaction by the infinite-range interaction (Curie-Weiss type\ninteraction). On the other hand, in the parameter region where the two\nensembles are equivalent, this replacement is always justified.

Many\nsimulations of gravitational collapse of a cold gas cloud followed by the\nformation of a protostellar core use a grey treatment of radiative transfer\ncoupled to the hydrodynamics. However, dust opacities which dominate extinction\nshow large variations as a function of frequency. In this paper, we used\nfrequency-dependent radiative transfer to investigate the influence of the\nopacity variations on the properties of Larson's first core. We used a\nmultigroup M1 moment model in a 1D radiation hydrodynamics code to simulate the\nspherically symmetric collapse of a 1 solar mass cloud core. Monochromatic dust\nopacities for five different temperature ranges were used to compute Planck and\nRosseland means inside each frequency group. The results are very consistent\nwith previous studies and only small differences were observed between the grey\nand multigroup simulations. For a same central density, the multigroup\nsimulations tend to produce first cores with a slightly higher radius and\ncentral temperature. We also performed simulations of the collapse of a 10 and\n0.1 solar mass cloud, which showed the properties of the first core to be\nindependent of the initial cloud mass, with again no major differences between\ngrey and multigroup models. For Larson's first collapse, where temperatures\nremain below 2000 K, the vast majority of the radiation energy lies in the IR\nregime and the system is optically thick. In this regime, the grey\napproximation does a good job reproducing the correct opacities, as long as\nthere are no large opacity variations on scales much smaller than the width of\nthe Planck function. The multigroup method is however expected to yield more\nimportant differences in the later stages of the collapse when high energy (UV\nand X-ray) radiation is present and matter and radiation are strongly\ndecoupled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 10:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

For such a system, the time stamps at which water drops separate\nfrom the faucet can be directly observed in real experiments, and the time\nseries of intervals \\tau_n between drop separations becomes a subject of\nanalysis. Even if the mass m_n of a drop at the onset of the n-th separation,\nwhich cannot be observed directly, exhibits perfectly deterministic dynamics,\nit sometimes fails to obtain important information from time series of \\tau_n.\nThis is because the return plot \\tau_n-1 vs. \\tau_n may become a multi-valued\nfunction, i.e., not a deterministic dynamical system. In this paper, we propose\na method to construct a nonlinear coordinate which provides a \"surrogate\" of\nthe internal state m_n from the time series of \\tau_n. Here, a key of the\nproposed approach is to use ISOMAP, which is a well-known method of manifold\nlearning.

Furthermore, we also analyze data\nobtained from real dripping faucet experiments which also provides promising\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 10:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Benefiting from these new developments, earth\nscientists try to recover the reflectance spectra of macroscopic materials\n(e.g., water, grass, mineral types...) present in an observed scene and to\nestimate their respective proportions in each mixed pixel of the acquired\nimage. This task is usually referred to as spectral mixture analysis or\nspectral unmixing (SU). SU aims at decomposing the measured pixel spectrum into\na collection of constituent spectra, called endmembers, and a set of\ncorresponding fractions (abundances) that indicate the proportion of each\nendmember present in the pixel. Similarly, when processing spectrum-images,\nmicroscopists usually try to map elemental, physical and chemical state\ninformation of a given material. This paper reports how a SU algorithm\ndedicated to remote sensing hyperspectral images can be successfully applied to\nanalyze spectrum-image resulting from electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS).\nSU generally overcomes standard limitations inherent to other multivariate\nstatistical analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or\nindependent component analysis (ICA), that have been previously used to analyze\nEELS maps. Indeed, ICA and PCA may perform poorly for linear spectral mixture\nanalysis due to the strong dependence between the abundances of the different\nmaterials.

An analysis of data\nrecorded by the ATLAS detector in 2010 in proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 33.4/pb is\nperformed, searching for supersymmetric final states containing jets and\nmissing transverse energy and no electrons or muons (zero-lepton channel). No\nexcess over the Standard Model background expectation is observed. Using the\nCLs and PLR methods, exclusion limits are set in two different supergravity\nmodels. These considerably extend the excluded parameter ranges from earlier\nexperiments.\n  The rates and efficiencies of triggers based on combined signatures with jets\nplus missing transverse energy in ATLAS are studied, which are the primary\ntriggers for the search for Supersymmetry in the zero-lepton channel. For the\nmeasurement of the efficiencies in data collected in 2010 and 2011, the\nbootstrap method is applied. Different sample triggers based on jets and\nmissing transverse energy are compared and their efficiencies are measured. A\nreweighting approach is used to correct for the bias from the propagation of\nthe uncertainties in the bootstrap method.\n  A universal model is developed to describe the contribution of fake missing\ntransverse energy from resolution effects to the rates of missing transverse\nenergy triggers as function of the level of in-time pile-up, i.e. the number of\nconcurrent proton-proton interactions. The input parameters are tuned to the\nproperties of the ATLAS trigger system, and the model predictions are compared\nto measurements of trigger rates in ATLAS. Good agreement is found for low\nthresholds for which the rates are dominated by resolution effects, whereas the\nrates for higher thresholds are underestimated due to additional sources of\nfake and real missing transverse energy, which are not incorporated in the\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 18:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-24"}

Some works have included\nnonparametric approaches while some have considered parametric structural\nmodels for complete as well as censored data sets; see Meeker et al. (1992),\nAntoniadis and Gr\\'egoire (1999), Rai and Singh (2003), Bezandry et al. (2005),\nBrunel and Comte (2008), and Mahapatra et al. (2012). Depending on the shapes\nof the hazard rate, efficiencies differ markedly across proposed estimators.\nThis situation is remarkable especially when different estimation techniques\nare utilized for unknown parameters of underlying distributions in parametric\napproaches. That is, estimated hazard rate (and also reliability) at a specific\ntime point t as functions of these estimators leads to inconsistent coverage\nprobabilities as distributional convergence of hazard rate estimator may not be\nat the desired rate for certain sample sizes.\n  This manuscript focuses on the estimation of monotone hazard rate when the\ndistribution of concern is of location-scale type. A very simple and efficient\napproximation of hazard rate for a complete sample is introduced as a function\nof order statistics, which allows a fast convergence to the asymptotic\ndistribution while achieving highly accurate coverage probabilities for\nconfidence intervals (CI). Efficiency of the method is demonstrated on\nsimulation studies by considering a number of location-scale distributions\nhaving various hazard shapes. We also consider the case of censored samples by\nincorporating the predicted future order statistics into the picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 14:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-24"}

The mission orbits of the 3 spacecraft forming a nearly equilateral\ntriangular array are chosen to be near the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L3, L4 and\nL5. The 3 spacecraft range interferometrically with one another with arm length\nabout 260 million kilometers.

Spatially resolved 2D maps of the properties of the ionized gas\nand the stellar populations were derived. Five of the observed galaxies have an\nongoing star formation rate of 1-5 M_sun/yr and mean stellar population ages ~5\nGyr. The sixth galaxy shows no star formation and has an about 12 Gyr old\nstellar population. All galaxies have stellar masses larger than 2E+10 M_sun\nand metallicities above solar. Four galaxies show negative radial metallicity\ngradients of the ionized gas up to -0.058 dex/kpc and one has nearly uniform\nmetallicity with a possible shallow positive slope. The stellar components show\nshallower negative metallicity gradients up to -0.03 dex/kpc. We find no clear\ncorrelation between the properties of the galaxy and those of the supernovae,\nwhich may be because of the small ranges spanned by the galaxy parameters.\nHowever, we note that the Hubble residuals are on average positive while\nnegative Hubble residuals are expected for SNe Ia in massive hosts such as the\ngalaxies in our sample. In conclusion, IFU spectroscopy on 4-m telescopes is a\nviable technique for studying host galaxies of nearby SNe Ia. It allows one to\ncorrelate the supernova properties with the properties of their host galaxies\nat the projected positions of the supernovae. Our current sample of six\ngalaxies is too small to draw conclusions about the SN Ia progenitors or\ncorrelations with the galaxy properties, but the ongoing CALIFA IFU survey will\nprovide a solid basis to exploit this technique more and improve our\nunderstanding of SNe Ia as cosmological standard candles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 14:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 13:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 May 2012 08:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\nground state in KA2 is of the form $\\bar{\\cal M}^{n+4}=\\bar{\\cal\nC}^{n+1}\\times\\IR^3$, where the static (averaged-out over scales ${\\rm L}>>{\\rm\nL_o}$) $\\bar{\\cal C}^{n+1}$ carries {\\em effective torsion} as relic of the\ndeeper vacuum dynamics at Planck scale. For the simplest non-trivial\nimplementation of KA2, the Bianchi IX subclass of SU(2)-invariant ${\\cal\nB}^4_{\\rm IX}$ provides the $\\bar{\\cal C}^5=\\bar{\\cal B}^4_{\\rm M}\\times S^1$,\nwith the $S^1$ coming from 'augmentability', a complement to compactification.\nThe classical action involves (i) the gravitational and EW sectors in elegant\n{\\em hierarchy}, (ii) the {\\em higgsless} emergence and full calculability of\nthe EW gauge bosons masses and (iii) gravity as a necessarily effective field,\nhence non-quantizable. A conjectured ${\\cal C}^{n+1}$ with $n\\leq 7$ (to adjoin\nthe strong interaction) toward a standard model 2, might also offer novel\nperspectives for supergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 May 2012 09:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}
