It is clear, that gene expression patterns cannot explain the\ndevelopment of the precise geometry of an organism and its parts in space.\nHere, we suggest a set of postulates and possible approaches for discovering\nthe correspondence between molecular biological information and its realization\nin a given geometry of an organism in space-time. First, we suggest that the\ngeometry of the organism and its parts is coded by a molecular code located on\nthe cell surfaces in such a way that, with each cell, there can be associated a\ncorresponding matrix, containing this code. As a particular model, we propose\ncoding by several types of oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates. Second,\nwe provide a notion of cell event, and suggest a description of development as\na tree of cell events, where under cell event we understand the changing of\ncell state, e.g. the processes of cell division, cell growth/death, shift or\ndifferentiation. Next we suggest describing these cell motion laws using the\nnotion of a \"morphogenetic field\", meaning by the field an object in an \"event\nspace\" over a \"cell space\", which govern the transformation of the coded\nbiological information into an instructive signal for a cell event for a given\ncell, depending on the position of a cell in the developing embryo. The matrix\non a cell surface will be changed after each cell event according to the\nrule(s) dictated by the morphogenetic field of an organism.

Given a search problem with a hidden\ninput, we are asked to find a valid solution, to find which we can propose\ncandidate solutions (trials), and use observed violations (errors), to prepare\nfuture proposals. In accordance with our motivating applications, we consider\nthe fairly broad class of constraint satisfaction problems, and assume that\nerrors are signaled by a verification oracle in the format of the index of a\nviolated constraint (with the content of the constraint still hidden).\n  Our discoveries are summarized as follows. On one hand, despite the seemingly\nvery little information provided by the verification oracle, efficient\nalgorithms do exist for a number of important problems. For the Nash, Core,\nStable Matching, and SAT problems, the unknown-input versions are as hard as\nthe corresponding known-input versions, up to a factor of polynomial.

The exact origin of these particles remains currently unknown. We\nestimate the contribution to the annihilation signal of positrons generated in\nthe decay of radioactive 26Al, 56Ni and 44Ti. We adapted the GALPROP\npropagation code to simulate the transport and annihilation of radioactivity\npositrons in a model of our Galaxy. Using plausible source spatial\ndistributions, we explored several possible propagation scenarios to account\nfor the large uncertainties on the transport of ~1MeV positrons in the\ninterstellar medium. We then compared the predicted intensity distributions to\nthe INTEGRAL/SPI observations. We obtain similar intensity distributions with\nsmall bulge-to-disk ratios, even for extreme large-scale transport\nprescriptions. At least half of the positrons annihilate close to their\nsources, even when they are allowed to travel far away. In the high-diffusion,\nballistic case, up to 40% of them escape the Galaxy. In proportion, this\naffects bulge positrons more than disk positrons because they are injected\nfurther off the plane in a tenuous medium, while disk positrons are mostly\ninjected in the dense molecular ring. The predicted intensity distributions are\nfully consistent with the observed longitudinally-extended disk-like emission,\nbut the transport scenario cannot be strongly constrained by the current data.\nNucleosynthesis positrons alone cannot account for the observed annihilation\nemission in the frame of our model. An additional component is needed to\nexplain the strong bulge contribution, and the latter is very likely\nconcentrated in the central regions if positrons have initial energies in the\n100keV-1MeV range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 09:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

One promising\nsolution, femtocell technology, has been rapidly developed and deployed over\nthe past few years. One of the biggest challenges for femtocell deployment is\nlack of a clear business model. This paper investigates the economic incentive\nfor the cellular operator (also called macrocell operator) to enable femtocell\nservice by leasing spectrum resource to an independent femtocell operator. On\nthe one hand, femtocell services can increase communication service quality and\nthus increase the efficiency of the spectrum resource.

We model the\ninteractions between a macrocell operator, a femtocell operator, and users as a\nthree-stage dynamic game, and derive the equilibrium pricing and capacity\nallocation decisions. We show that when spectrum resources are very limited,\nthe macrocell operator has incentive to lease spectrum to femtocell operators,\nas femtocell service can provide access to more users and efficiently increase\nthe coverage. However, when the total spectrum resource is large, femtocell\nservice offers significant competition to macrocell service. Macrocell operator\nthus has less incentive to enable femtocell service.

To connect the\nlow and high z regimes, we present observations of the Lya line of six\n0.6<z<1.7 HI 21cm absorbers. The dataset is complemented by both VLBA\nobservations (to derive the absorber covering factor, f), and optical echelle\nspectra from which metal abundances are determined. Our dataset therefore not\nonly offers the largest statistical study of HI 21cm absorbers to date, and\nbridges the redshift desert, but is also the first to use a fully f-corrected\ndataset to look for metallicity-based trends. In agreement with trends found in\nGalactic sightlines, we find that the lowest N(HI) absorbers tend to be\ndominated by warm gas. In the DLA regime, spin temperatures show a wider range\nof values than Galactic data, as may be expected in a heterogenous galactic\npopulation. However, we find that low metallicity DLAs are dominated by small\ncold gas fractions and only absorbers with relatively high metallicities\nexhibit significant fractions of cold gas.

The second paper introduced,\nthrough a limiting process, the notion of generic cohomology, as an\nintermediary between finite Chevalley group and algebraic group cohomology. The\npresent paper shows that, for irreducible modules as coefficients, the limits\ncan be eliminated in all but finitely many cases. These exceptional cases\ndepend only on the root system and cohomological degree. In fact, we show that,\nfor sufficiently large r, depending only on the root system and m, and not on\nthe prime p or the irreducible module L, there are isomorphisms H^m(G(p^r),L)\n-> H^m(G(p^r),L') -> H^m_gen(G,L') -> H^m(G,L'), where the subscript \"gen\"\nrefers to generic cohomology and L' is a constructibly determined irreducible\n\"shift\" of the (arbitrary) irreducible module L for the finite Chevalley group\nG(p^r). By a famous theorem of Steinberg, both L and L' extend to irreducible\nmodules for the ambient algebraic group G with p^r-restricted highest weights.\nThis leads to the notion of a module or weight being \"shifted m-generic,\" and\nthus to the title of this paper. Our approach is based on questions raised by\nthe third author in [Stea], which we answer here in the cohomology cases. We\nobtain many additional results, often with formulations in the more general\ncontext of Ext^m_G(q) with irreducible coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 11:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

Over the\nyears, the $N^2$ nature of the direct force calculation has proved a barrier\nfor extending the particle number. Following an early introduction of force\npolynomials and individual time-steps, the calculation cost was first reduced\nby the introduction of a neighbour scheme. After a decade of GRAPE computers\nwhich speeded up the force calculation further, we are now in the era of GPUs\nwhere relatively small hardware systems are highly cost-effective. A\nsignificant gain in efficiency is achieved by employing the GPU to obtain the\nso-called regular force which typically involves some 99 percent of the\nparticles, while the remaining local forces are evaluated on the host. However,\nthe latter operation is performed up to 20 times more frequently and may still\naccount for a significant cost. This effort is reduced by parallel SSE/AVX\nprocedures where each interaction term is calculated using mainly single\nprecision. We also discuss further strategies connected with coordinate and\nvelocity prediction required by the integration scheme.

From this,\none can then hopefully utilize the proposed technique for shape analysis,\nregistration, as well as other related computer graphics tasks. More\nimportantly, given that we seek to establish a one-to-one correspondence of an\ninput volume to that of a solid cube, our algorithm can naturally generate a\nquality hexahedral mesh as an output. In addition, we constrain the mapping\nitself to be volume preserving allowing for the possibility of further mesh\nsimplification. We demonstrate our method both qualitatively and quantitatively\non various 3D solid models\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 15:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

To fit into the academic workflow non-linear reading, bookmarking,\ncommenting, extracting text or the integration of non-textual elements must be\nsupported. A group of social science students were questioned about their\nexperiences with electronic publications for study purposes. This same group\nexecuted several text-related tasks with the digitized material presented to\nthem in two different file formats on four different e-readers. Their\nperformances were subsequently evaluated by means of frequency analyses in\ndetail. Findings - e-Publications have made advances in the academic world;\nhowever e-readers do not yet fit seamlessly into the established chain of\nscholarly text-processing focusing on how readers use material during and after\nreading. Our tests revealed major deficiencies in these techniques. With a\nsmall number of participants (n=26) qualitative insights can be obtained, not\nrepresentative results. Further testing with participants from various\ndisciplines and of varying academic status is required to arrive at more\nbroadly applicable results. Practical implications - Our test results help to\noptimize file conversion routines for scholarly texts. We evaluated our data on\nthe basis of descriptive statistics and abstained from any statistical\nsignificance test. The usability test of e-readers in a scientific context\naligns with both studies on the prevalence of e-books in the sciences and\ntechnical test reports of portable reading devices. Still, it takes a\ndistinctive angle in focusing on the characteristics and procedures of textual\nwork in the social sciences and measures the usability of e-readers and\nfile-features against these standards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 15:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

The SU(6) is broken down to the Standard Model gauge groups in two\nsteps by an orbifold projection (or Wilson line), followed by a Wilson line.\nThe Higgs doublets of the low energy electroweak theory come from a chiral\nadjoint of SU(6). We thus have gauge-Higgs unification. The three families of\nthe Standard Model can either be located in the 6D bulk or at 4D N=1\nsupersymmetric fixed points.\n  We calculate the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of states arising as a result of the\norbifolding. We also calculate the threshold corrections to the coupling\nconstants due to this tower of states at the lowest compactification scale. We\nstudy the regions of parameter space of this model where the threshold\ncorrections are consistent with low energy physics. We find that the couplings\nreceive only logarithmic corrections at all scales. This feature can be\nattributed to the large N=2 6D SUSY of the underlying model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 May 2012 15:41:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 23:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 21:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
