Complex\nappearance of the Fourier phase lags related to QPOs is one of the most\npuzzling observational effects in accreting black holes. In this Letter we show\nthat QPO properties, including phase lags, can be explained in a framework of a\nsimple scenario, where the oscillating media provides a feedback on the\nemerging spectrum. We demonstrate that the QPO waveform is presented by the\nproduct of a perturbation and a time delayed response factors, where the\nresponse is energy dependent. The essential property of this effect is its\nnon-linear and multiplicative nature. Our multiplicative reverberation model\nsuccessfully describes the QPO components in energy dependent power spectra as\nwell as the appearance of the phase lags between signal in different energy\nbands. We apply our model to QPOs observed by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in BH\ncandidate XTE J1550-564. We briefly discuss the implications of the observed\nenergy dependence of the QPO reverberation times and amplitudes to the nature\nof the power law spectral component and its variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 16:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Combined with\nthe spherical harmonic transform, this approach leads to a sampling theorem on\nthe ball and a novel three-dimensional decomposition which we call the\nFourier-Laguerre transform.

The two\nclasses are comprised of: (1) The weak jet sources, corresponding to FR I radio\ngalaxies, having a decelerating or spine-sheath jet with velocity gradients,\nand (2) The strong jet sources, having fast, collimated jets, and typically\ndisplaying strong emission lines. The dichotomy in the \\nu_peak-L_peak plane\ncan be understood as a `broken power sequence' in which jets exist on one\nbranch or the other based on the particular accretion mode. We suggest that the\nintrinsic kinetic power (as measured by low-frequency, isotropic radio\nemission), the orientation, and the accretion rate of the SMBH system are the\nthe fundamental axes needed for unification of radio-loud AGN by studying a\nwell-characterized sample of several hundred Fermi-detected jets.

This goes against widespread simulation practices of\nevolutionary games, where players frequently consider changing their strategy\neven though their payoffs may be marginally different than those of the other\nplayers. Inspired by this observation, we introduce an aspiration-based\nwin-stay-lose-learn strategy updating rule into the spatial prisoner's dilemma\ngame. The rule is simple and intuitive, foreseeing strategy changes only by\ndissatisfied players, who then attempt to adopt the strategy of one of their\nnearest neighbors, while the strategies of satisfied players are not subject to\nchange. We find that the proposed win-stay-lose-learn rule promotes the\nevolution of cooperation, and it does so very robustly and independently of the\ninitial conditions. In fact, we show that even a minute initial fraction of\ncooperators may be sufficient to eventually secure a highly cooperative final\nstate. In addition to extensive simulation results that support our\nconclusions, we also present results obtained by means of the pair\napproximation of the studied game.

We demonstrate that\nconsistency is key for both validating the models and probing the underlying\nphysics.

We show that the unusual\nlight curve decline can be understood with the same physics as has been used to\nunderstand the Delta-m15 relation for normal SNe Ia. The decline relation can\nbe explained by a combination of the temperature dependence of the opacity and\nexcess or deficit of the peak luminosity, alpha, measured relative to the\ninstantaneous rate of radiative decay energy generation. What differentiates SN\n2001ay from normal SNe Ia is a higher explosion energy which leads to a shift\nof the Ni56 distribution towards higher velocity and alpha < 1.

We define a class of SN\n2001ay-like SNe Ia, which will show an anti-Phillips relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 20:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In particular, we examine the\nimpact of various system parameters and of the main workload characteristics.\nWe show that a window-based measurement scheme can be fairly accurate in\npractice, as long as its window duration has been appropriately configured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 20:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-07"}

In the last few years, the rate of progress in spatial data collection\nwas higher, than in management and analysis of data. Infrastructures allow the\naccumulated data to be available to large groups of users, and infrastructure\nof analysis allows the data to be effectively used for such tasks as municipal\nplanning, science research, etc. Moreover, free access to the information\nresources and instruments of analysis will serve as an additional impulse to\ndevelopment of application models in corresponding areas of expertise. The goal\nof this paper is to indicate possible solutions to the client-side problems of\nspatial data analysis in distributed environments, using the developing\napplication for data analysis as an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 00:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-07"}

Allowing the full freedom in the effective masses in\nboth models leads to constraints of 30<~J<~31.5 MeV, 35<~L<~60 MeV,\n-330<~K_tau<~-216 MeV for the RMF model as a whole and 30<~J<~33 MeV, 28<~L<~65\nMeV, -420<~K_tau<~-325 MeV for the SHF model as a whole. Notably, given PNM\nconstraints, these results place RMF and SHF models as a whole at odds with\nsome constraints on K_tau inferred from giant monopole resonance and neutron\nskin experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 03:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 20:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

The model is an attempt to evade\nthe coincidence and cosmological constant problems of the standard model\n($\\Lambda$CDM) and also to connect the early and late time accelerating stages\nof the Universe. Our space-time emerges from a pure initial de Sitter stage\nthereby providing a natural solution to the horizon problem. Subsequently, due\nto an instability provoked by the production of massless particles, the\nUniverse evolves smoothly to the standard radiation dominated era thereby\nending the production of radiation as required by the conformal invariance.\nNext, the radiation becomes sub-dominant with the Universe entering in the cold\ndark matter dominated era. Finally, the negative pressure associated with the\ncreation of cold dark matter (CCDM model) particles accelerates the expansion\nand drives the Universe to a final de Sitter stage. The late time cosmic\nexpansion history of the CCDM model is exactly like in the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, however, there is no dark energy. This complete scenario is\nfully determined by two extreme energy densities, or equivalently, the\nassociated de Sitter Hubble scales connected by $\\rho_I/\\rho_f=(H_I/H_f)^{2}\n\\sim 10^{122}$, a result that has no correlation with the cosmological constant\nproblem.

The\noutburst amplitude was 4.6 magnitudes and it lasted at least 10 days, with a\nmaximum brightness of magnitude 14.3. We determined the mean superhump period\nfrom our first 5 nights of observations as Psh = 0.06728(21) d. However\nanalysis of the O-C residuals showed a dramatic evolution in Psh during the\noutburst. During the first part of the plateau phase the period increased with\ndPsh/dt = +2.67(15) x 10-4. There was then an abrupt change following which the\nperiod decreased with dPsh/dt = -2.08(9)x 10-4.

Also, a\nmodel to be studied for addressing such an idea could possibly provide us some\nnew consequences about the interactions of particles as well as their internal\nstructures. Motivated mainly by this idea, in this work, we consider a\nq-deformed Fermi gas model whose statistical properties enable effectively us\nto study interpolating statistics. Starting with a generalized Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution function, we derive several thermostatistical functions of a gas\nof these deformed fermions in the thermodynamical limit. We study the high\ntemperature behavior of the system by analyzing the effects of q-deformation on\nthe most important thermostatistical characteristics of the system such as the\nentropy, specific heat, and equation of state. It is shown that such a deformed\nfermion model in two and three spatial dimensions exhibits the interpolating\nstatistics in a specific interval of the model deformation parameter 0 < q < 1.\nIn particular, for two and three spatial dimensions, it is found from the\nbehavior of the third virial coefficient of the model that the deformation\nparameter q interpolates completely between attractive and repulsive systems,\nincluding the free boson and fermion cases. From the results obtained in this\nwork, we conclude that such a model could provide much physical insight into\nsome interacting theories of fermions, and could be useful to further study the\nparticle systems with intermediate statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 11:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-07"}

Our parent sample consists of 3757 face-on disk\ngalaxies with redshifts between 0.01 and 0.05, selected from the seventh Data\nRelease of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. 1555 galaxies with bars are identified\nusing position angle and ellipticity profiles of the $i$-band light. We compare\nthe ratio of the specific star formation rate measured in the 1-3 kpc central\nregion of the galaxy to that measured for the whole galaxy. Galaxies with\nstrong bars have centrally enhanced star formation; the degree of enhancement\ndepends primarily on the ellipticity of the bar, and not on the size of the bar\nor on the mass or structure of the host galaxy. The fraction of galaxies with\nstrong bars is highest at stellar masses greater than $3 \\times 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$, stellar surface densities less than $3 \\times 10^8 M_{\\odot}$ and\nconcentration indices less than 2.5. In this region of parameter space,\ngalaxies with strong bars either have enhanced central star formation rates, or\nstar formation that is {\\em suppressed} compared to the mean. This suggests\nthat bars may play a role in the eventual quenching of star formation in\ngalaxies. Only 50% of galaxies with strongly concentrated star formation have\nstrong bars, indicating that other processes such as galaxy interactions also\ninduce central star-bursts. We also find that the ratio of the size of the bar\nto that of the disk depends mainly on the colour of the galaxy, suggesting that\nthe growth and destruction of bars are regulated by gas accretion, as suggested\nby simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 12:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

Local HAEs\nhave lower stellar mass and lower ultraviolet (UV) luminosity than z~4 HAEs,\nyet the Halpha-to-UV luminosity ratio as well as their specific star-formation\nrate is consistent with that of z~4 HAEs indicating that they are scaled down\nversions of high-z star-forming galaxies. Compared to the previously studied\nlocal analogs of z~2 Lyman break galaxies selected using rest-frame UV, local\nHAEs show similar UV luminosity surface density, weaker Dn(4000) breaks, lower\nmetallicity and lower stellar mass. This supports the idea that local HAEs are\nless evolved galaxies than the traditional Lyman break analogs. We are not able\nto constrain if the star-formation history in local HAEs is powered by mergers\nor by cosmological cold flow accretion.

We show that\nthe 2:1 resonance occurs the most frequently. Among other resonances, the 3:1\nresonance is the second most common, and furthermore both 3:2 and 5:3\nresonances occur more often than the 4:1 resonance. Moreover, the resonances in\nthe coplanar CR3BP are classified based on the behaviour of the orbits.

We study the impact on the maximum\npossible neutron-star mass of an \"exotic\" core consisting of non-nucleonic\nmatter. For this purpose, we study the occurrence of a first-order phase\ntransition in nucleonic matter. Given the current lack of knowledge of\nnon-nucleonic matter, we consider the stiffest possible equation of state\nsubject only to the constraints of causality and thermodynamic stability. The\ncase of a hadron-quark phase transition is discussed separately. The purely\nnucleonic matter is described using a set of unified equations of state that\nhave been recently developed to permit a consistent treatment of both\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. We then compute the mass-radius relation\nof cold nonaccreting neutron stars with and without exotic cores from the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. We find that even if there is a\nsignificant softening of the equation of state associated with the actual\ntransition to an exotic phase, there can still be a stiffening at higher\ndensities closer to the center of the star that is sufficient to increase the\nmaximum possible mass. However with quarks the maximum neutron-star mass is\nalways reduced by assuming that the sound speed is limited by $c/\\sqrt{3}$ as\nsuggested by QCD calculations. In particular, by invoking such a phase\ntransition, it becomes possible to support PSR J1614$-$2230 with a nucleonic\nequation of state that is soft enough to be compatible with the kaon and pion\nproduction in heavy-ion collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 15:30:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 13:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-25"}

While most approaches use heuristics, biology suggests that\nthere must exist an unsupervised method to construct such filters\nautomatically. Besides the extraction of environmental states, the filters have\nto represent them in a fashion that support modern reinforcement algorithms.\nMany popular algorithms use a linear architecture, so one should aim at filters\nthat have good approximation properties in combination with linear functions.\nThis thesis wants to propose the unsupervised method slow feature analysis\n(SFA) for this task. Presented with a random sequence of sensor readings, SFA\nlearns a set of filters. With growing model complexity and training examples,\nthe filters converge against trigonometric polynomial functions. These are\nknown to possess excellent approximation capabilities and should therfore\nsupport the reinforcement algorithms well. We evaluate this claim on a robot.\nThe task is to learn a navigational control in a simple environment using the\nleast square policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm. The only accessible sensor is a\nhead mounted video camera, but without meaningful filtering, video images are\nnot suited as LSPI input. We will show that filters learned by SFA, based on a\nrandom walk video of the robot, allow the learned control to navigate\nsuccessfully in ca. 80% of the test trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 May 2012 15:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-07"}

Selection is\nbased on UV, optical and IR photometry from existing large-area surveys and\nproper motions from the Southern Proper Motion 4 catalog (SPM4). The spatial\ndistribution of these young star candidates shows: 1) a well-populated SMC wing\nwhich continues westward with two branches partially surrounding the SMC, 2) a\nrather narrow path from the SMC wing eastward toward the LMC which is offset by\n1 to 2 deg. from the high-density H I ridge in the Bridge, 3) a well-populated\nperiphery of the LMC dominated by clumps of stars at the ends of the LMC bar\nand 4) a few scattered candidates in the MS and two overdensities in the LA\nregions above and below the Galactic plane. Additionally, a proper-motion\nanalysis is made of a radial-velocity selected sample of red giants and\nsupergiants in the LMC, previously shown to be a kinematically and chemically\ndistinct subgroup, most likely captured from the SMC. SPM4 proper motions of\nthese stars also indicate they are distinct from the LMC population.

Assuming each resonator is coupled with a two-level system\nvia a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, we calculate the many-body steady state\nbehavior of the system under coherent pumping and dissipation. We propose and\nanalyze the many-body phases using experimentally accessible quantities such as\nthe total excitation number, the emitted photon spectra and photon coherence\nfunctions for different parameter regimes. In parallel, we also compare and\ncontrast the expected behavior of this system assuming the local nonlinearity\nin the cavities is generated by a generic Kerr effect rather than a\nJaynes-Cummings interaction. We find that the behavior of the experimentally\naccessible observables produced by the two models differs for realistic regimes\nof interactions even when the corresponding nonlinearities are of similar\nstrength. We analyze in detail the extra features available in the\nJaynes-Cummings-Hubbard (JCH) model originating from the mixed nature of the\nexcitations and investigate the regimes where the Kerr approximation would\nfaithfully match the JCH physics. We find that the latter is true for values of\nthe light-matter coupling and losses beyond the reach of current technology.\nThroughout the study we operate in the weak pumping, fully quantum mechanical\nregime where approaches such as mean field theory fail, and instead use a\ncombination of quantum trajectories and the time evolving block decimation\nalgorithm to compute the relevant steady state observables.
