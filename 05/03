The observed\nfield contains: five protoplanetary discs (also known as proplyds), the\nhigh-velocity jet HH 514 and a bowshock. Spatial distribution maps are obtained\nfor different emission line fluxes, the c(H{\\beta}) coefficient, electron\ndensities and temperatures, ionic abundances of different ions from\ncollisionally excited lines (CELs), C2+ and O2+ abundances from recombination\nlines (RLs) and the abundance discrepancy factor of O2+, ADF(O2+). We find that\ncollisional de-excitation has a major influence on the line fluxes in the\nproplyds. If this is not properly accounted for then physical conditions\ndeduced from commonly used line ratios will be in error, leading to unreliable\nchemical abundances for these objects.

A detailed analysis of 177-341 spectra reveals the presence\nof high-density gas (3.8\\times10^5 cm^-3) in contrast to the typical values\nobserved in the background gas of the nebula (3800 cm^-3). We also explore how\nthe background subtraction could be affected by the possible opacity of the\nproplyd.

It is thus a\nlong-standing scientific dream to measure the dynamics of two bound correlated\nelectrons in the quantum regime. Quantum wave packets were previously observed\nfor single-active electrons on their natural attosecond timescales. However, at\nleast two active electrons and a nucleus are required to address the quantum\nthree-body problem. This situation is realized in the helium atom, but direct\ntime-resolved observation of two-electron wave-packet motion remained an\nunaccomplished challenge. Here, we measure a 1.2-femtosecond quantum beating\namong low-lying doubly-excited states in helium to evidence a correlated\ntwo-electron wave packet. Our experimental method combines attosecond\ntransient-absorption spectroscopy at unprecedented high spectral resolution (20\nmeV near 60 eV) with an intensity-tuneable visible laser field to couple the\nquantum states from the perturbative to the strong-coupling regime. This\nmulti-dimensional transient-coupling scheme reveals an inversion of the\ncharacteristic Fano line shapes for a range of doubly-excited states. Employing\nFano-type autoionization as a natural quantum interferometer, a dynamical phase\nshift by laser coupling to the N=2 continuum is postulated and experimentally\nquantified. This phase maps a transition from effectively\nsingle-active-electron to two-electron dynamics as the electron-electron\ninteraction increases in lower-lying quantum states. In the future, such\nexperiments will provide benchmark data for testing dynamical few-body quantum\ntheory. They will boost our understanding of chemically and biologically\nimportant metastable electronic transition states and their dynamics on\nattosecond time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 May 2012 18:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-03"}

For a subset of 302 galaxies at 1.5<z<2.6, we\nperform a comparison of star formation rates (SFRs) determined from SED\nmodeling (SFRs[SED]) and those calculated from deep Keck UV and Spitzer/MIPS 24\nmicron imaging (SFRs[IR+UV]). Exponentially declining SFHs yield SFRs[SED] that\nare 5-10x lower on average than SFRs[IR+UV], indicating that declining SFHs may\nnot be accurate for typical galaxies at z>2. The SFRs of z~2-3 galaxies are\ndirectly proportional to their stellar masses M*, with unity slope---a result\nthat is confirmed with Spitzer/IRAC stacks of 1179 UV-faint (R>25.5)\ngalaxies---for M*>5e8 Msun and SFRs >2 Msun/yr. We interpret this result in the\ncontext of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of the\nSFR-M* relation. The average specific SFRs at z~2-3 are similar within a factor\nof two to those measured at z>4, implying an average SFH where SFRs increase\nwith time. A consequence of these rising SFHs is that (a) a substantial\nfraction of UV-bright z~2-3 galaxies had faint sub-L* progenitors at z>4; and\n(b) gas masses must increase with time from z=7 to 2, over which time the net\ncold gas accretion rate---as inferred from the specific SFR and the\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation---is ~2-3x larger than the SFR . However, if we\nevolve to higher redshift the SFHs and masses of the halos that are expected to\nhost L* galaxies at z~2, we find that <10% of the baryons accreted onto typical\nhalos at z>4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. These\nresults highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at early\ncosmic times when galaxies were first assembling.

The existence of the $f_{\\rm NL}$ increases the signal of the\ncross-correlation at large scales and the amplification does not depend on the\nreionization parameters in our reionization model.

Adopting the topological diagram approach, we\nstudy flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking effects in the weak decay tree amplitudes\nof singly Cabibbo-suppressed $D\\to PP$ decays. The symmetry breaking in the\ncolor-allowed and color-suppressed amplitudes is estimated with the help of the\nfactorization ansatz, while that in the $W$-exchange amplitude is done by\nfitting to related branching fraction data. We find that the $W$-exchange\namplitudes stay in the second quadrant relative to the color-allowed tree\namplitude, albeit there are two possibilities for one type of $W$-exchange\namplitude. The weak decay penguin amplitudes, on the other hand, are evaluated\nwithin the framework of QCD factorization.

The\npredictions of branching fractions are generally improved from those in the\nSU(3) limit.

However, they describe a mechanism for this problem, for any number of\nplayers, that is an epsilon-Nash equilibrium, in that no player can gain more\nthan epsilon utility by deviating from it. Unfortunately, the Kol and Naor\nmechanism, and, to the best of our knowledge, all previous mechanisms for this\nproblem require each agent to send O(n) messages in expectation, where n is the\nnumber of agents.

Moreover, the latency of this mechanism is O(log n) in\nexpectation, compared to O(n) expected latency for the Kol and Naor result. Our\nsecond result is a mechanism for a relaxed variant of rational m-out-of-n\nsecret sharing where m = Theta(n). It requires each processor to send O(log n)\nbits and has O(log n) latency.

Of the 36 nearby galaxies examined, 21 had sufficiently\ngood data to search for globular cluster hosts. None of the 21 supernovae have\na definite globular cluster counterpart, although there are some ambiguous\ncases.

Even\nif all of the ambiguous cases are considered as having a globular cluster\ncounterpart, the upper bound for the enhancement rate is 82 at the 95%\nconfidence level, excluding an enhancement rate of 200. Barring unforeseen\nselection effects, we conclude that globular clusters are not responsible for\nproducing a significant fraction of the SN Ia events in early-type galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 00:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We show that $n \\geq 0$ is required by the recent cosmic accelerated\nexpansion of universe. In the early universe dominated by the constituent with\nconstant equation of state $w_m$, we have $w_{de}\\simeq -1-\\frac{2n}{3}$ for $n\n\\geq 0$ and $m<0$, and $w_{de}\\simeq-\\frac23(n-m)+w_m$ for $n > m \\geq 0$. The\nmodels with $n > m \\geq 0$ become single-parameter models like the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel due to the analytic feature $\\Omega_{de}\\simeq\n\\frac{d^2}4(2m+3w_m+3)^2a^{2(n-m)}$ at radiation- and matter-dominated epoch.\nWhereas the cases $n=m\\geq 0$ should be abandoned as the dark energy cannot\ndominate the universe forever and there might be too large fraction of dark\nenergy in early universe, and the cases $m> n \\geq 0$ are forbidden by the\nself-consistent requirement $\\Omega_{de}\\ll1 $ in the early universe. Thus a\ndetailed study on the single-parameter models corresponding to cases $n >m \\geq\n0$ is carried out by using recent observations. The best-fit analysis indicates\nthat the conformal-age-like models with $n=m+1$, i.e. $L\\propto\\frac1{Ha}$ in\nearly universe, are more favored and also the models with smaller $n$ for the\ngiven $n-m$ are found to fit the observations better. The equation of state of\nthe dark energy in models with $n=m+1 >0$ transits from $w_{de}<-1$ during\ninflation to $w_{de}>-1$ in radiation- and matter-dominated epoch, and then\nback to $w_{de}<-1$ eventually.

Yet practical receiver\ndesigns impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical\ncircuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode\nthe carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a\ngeneral receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits\nthe received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and\ninformation decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time\nswitching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS)\nare investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of\nOPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures,\nnamely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The\nintegrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated\nreceiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for\nthe two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E)\nregion. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different\nrate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into\naccount, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the\nideal case when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is\noptimal for both receivers. In addition, we study the performance for the two\ntypes of receivers under a realistic system setup that employs practical\nmodulation. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal practical\nreceiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer\n(SWIPT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 05:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 01:56:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 02:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-09"}

Taking GPS traces of human\nwalks from the real world, we find that there exist two known phenomena. One is\npublic hotspot, the other is personal hotspot. Motivated by this observation,\nwe present Hoten (hotspot and entropy), a novel routing metric to improve\nrouting performance in DTNs.

To overcome\nthat overly restrictive stability constraint on the time-step, yet without\nresorting to implicit methods, explicit local time-stepping schemes (LTS) are\npresented here for transient wave equations either with or without damping. In\nthe undamped case, leap-frog based LTS methods lead to high-order explicit LTS\nschemes, which conserve the energy. In the damped case, when energy is no\nlonger conserved, Adams-Bashforth based LTS methods also lead to explicit LTS\nschemes of arbitrarily high accuracy.

The parameter region, where this nonmagnetic phase exists,\nincreases with decreasing of lambda. For the ferromagnetic case (J1 < 0) we\nhave the trivial ferromagnetic ground state at small J2/|J1|. By increasing of\nJ2 this classical phase gives way for a semi-classical plaquette phase, where\nthe plaquette block spins of length s=2 are antiferromagnetically long-range\nordered. Further increasing of J2 then yields collinear striped\nantiferromagnetic long-range order for lambda \\gtrsim 0.38, but a nonmagnetic\nquantum paramagnetic phase lambda \\lesssim 0.38.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 11:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

(For our\npurposes it is irrelevant if the automata has initial or final states.) Our\ndeparture point is the study of the transition semigroup associated to the\nautomaton, taking advantage of the enormous and very deep progresses made\nduring the last decades on the theory of permutation groups, their geometry and\ntheir combinatorial structure.\n  Let $X$ be a finite set. We say that a primitive group $G$ on $X$ is {\\em\nsynchronizing} if $G$ together with any non-invertible map on $X$ generates a\nconstant map. It is known (by some recent results proved by P. M. Neumann) that\nfor some primitive groups $G$ and for some singular transformations $t$ of\nuniform kernel (that is, all blocks have the same number of elements), the\nsemigroup $< G,t>$ does not generate a constant map. Therefore the following\nconcept is very natural: a primitive group $G$ on $X$ is said to be {\\em almost\nsynchronizing} if $G$ together with any map of non-uniform kernel generates a\nconstant map. In this paper we use two different methods to provide several\ninfinite families of groups that are not synchronizing, but are almost\nsynchronizing. The paper ends with a number of problems on synchronization\nlikely to attract the attention of experts in computer science, combinatorics\nand geometry, groups and semigroups, linear algebra and matrix theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 11:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-04"}

The solar eruptions are very intense involving\nX-class flares and extreme CME speeds (average ~2000 km/s). The active regions\nin which the GLE events originate are generally large: 1290 msh (median 1010\nmsh) compared to 934 msh (median: 790 msh) for SEP-producing active regions.\nThe initial acceleration of GLE-associated CMEs is much larger (by a factor of\n2) than that of ordinary CMEs (2.3 km/s2 vs.1 km/s2). The GLE particle release\nis delayed with respect to the onset of all electromagnetic signatures of the\neruptions: type II bursts, low frequency type III bursts, soft X-ray flares and\nCMEs. The presence of metric type II radio bursts some 17 min (median: 16 min;\nrange: 3 to 48 min) before the GLE onset indicates shock formation well before\nthe particle release. The release of GLE particles occurs when the CMEs reach\nan average height of ~3.09 Rs for well-connected events. For poorly connected\nevents, the average CME height at GLE particle release is ~66% larger (mean:\n5.18 Rs). The longitudinal dependence is consistent with shock accelerations\nbecause the shocks from poorly connected events need to expand more to cross\nthe field lines connecting to an Earth observer. The CME height at metric type\nII burst onset is in the narrow range 1.29 to 1.8 Rs, with A mean of 1.53 Rs.\nThe CME heights at metric type II burst onset and GLE particle release\ncorrespond to the minimum and maximum in the Alfven speed profile. The CME\nheights at GLE particle release are in good agreement with those obtained from\nthe velocity dispersion analysis (Reames, 2009a,b) including the source\nlongitude dependence.

We propose a new coded modulation paradigm: error-correction outer\ncode with space-only but time-varying precoder (as inner code). We refer to the\nlatter as Ergodic Mutual Information (EMI) code. The EMI code achieves the\nmaximal multiplexing gain and full diversity is proved in terms of the outage\nprobability. Contrary to most of the literature, our work is not based on the\nelegant but difficult classical algebraic MIMO theory. Instead, the relation\nbetween MIMO and parallel channels is exploited. The theoretical proof of full\ndiversity is corroborated by means of numerical simulations for many MIMO\nscenarios, in terms of outage probability and word error rate of LDPC coded\nsystems. The full-diversity and full-rate at low detection complexity comes at\na price of a small coding gain loss for outer coding rates close to one, but\nthis loss vanishes with decreasing coding rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 12:55:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 18:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}

The approaches proposed\nhere can be readily extended to quantify fingerprints of electoral fraud in any\nother problematic elections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 15:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 09:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-18"}

In order to convert the\nexpansion speed to radial speed (which is important for space weather\napplications) one can use an empirical relationship between the two that\nassumes an average width for all CMEs. If we have the width information from\nquadrature observations, we can confirm the relationship between expansion and\nradial speeds derived by Gopalswamy et al. (2009a). The STEREO spacecraft were\nin qudrature with SOHO (STEREO-A ahead of Earth by 87o and STEREO-B 94o behind\nEarth) on 2011 February 15, when a fast Earth-directed CME occurred. The CME\nwas observed as a halo by the Large-Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)\non board SOHO. The sky-plane speed was measured by SOHO/LASCO as the expansion\nspeed, while the radial speed was measured by STEREO-A and STEREO-B. In\naddition, STEREO-A and STEREO-B images provided the width of the CME, which is\nunknown from Earth view. From the SOHO and STEREO measurements, we confirm the\nrelationship between the expansion speed (Vexp) and radial speed (Vrad) derived\npreviously from geometrical considerations (Gopalswamy et al. 2009a): Vrad =\n1/2 (1 + cot w)Vexp, where w is the half width of the CME. STEREO-B images of\nthe CME, we found that CME had a full width of 76o, so w = 38o. This gives the\nrelation as Vrad = 1.14 Vexp. From LASCO observations, we measured Vexp = 897\nkm/s, so we get the radial speed as 1023 km/s. Direct measurement of radial\nspeed yields 945 km/s (STEREO-A) and 1058 km/s (STEREO-B). These numbers are\ndifferent only by 7.6% and 3.4% (for STEREO-A and STEREO-B, respectively) from\nthe computed value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 May 2012 15:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-04"}
