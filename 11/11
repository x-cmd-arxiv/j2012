The information accumulated time-by-time and included in\nthe GO is encoded in the definition of terms and in the setting up of semantic\nrelations amongst terms. This approach might be usefully complemented by a\nbottom-up approach based on the knowledge of relationships amongst genes. To\nthis end, we investigate the Gene Ontology from a complex network perspective.\nWe consider the semantic network of terms naturally associated with the\nsemantic relationships provided by the Gene Ontology consortium and a\ngene-based weighted network in which the nodes are the terms and a link between\nany two terms is set up whenever genes are annotated in both terms. One aim of\nthe present paper is to understand whether the semantic and the gene-based\nnetwork share the same structural properties or not. We then consider network\ncommunities. The identification of communities in the SVNs network can\ntherefore be the basis of a simple protocol aiming at fully exploiting the\npossible relationships amongst terms, thus improving the knowledge of the\nsemantic structure of GO. This is also important from a biomedical point of\nview, as it might reveal how genes over-expressed in a certain term also affect\nother biological functions not directly linked by the GO semantics. As a\nby-product, we present a simple methodology that allows to have a first glance\ninsight about the biological characterization of groups of GO terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2012 20:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

We try to identify resonances which are expected\nto occur when a mean-field dynamo excites waves of quasi-stationary magnetic\nfield in two distinct spherical layers. We isolate some features that can be\nassociated with resonances in the profiles of energy or frequency plotted\nversus a dynamo governing parameter. Rather unexpectedly however the resonances\nin spherical dynamos take a much less spectacular form than resonances in many\nmore familiar branches of physics. In particular, we find that the magnitudes\nof resonant phenomena are much smaller than seem detectable by astronomical\nobservations, and plausibly any related effects in laboratory dynamo\nexperiments (which of course are not in gravitating spheres!) are also small.\nWe discuss specific features relevant to resonant phenomena in spherical\ndynamos, and find parametric resonance to be the most pronounced type of\nresonance phenomena. Resonance conditions for these dynamo wave resonances are\nrather different from those for more conventional branches of physics. We\nsuggest that the relative insignificance of the phenomenon in this case is\nbecause the phenomena of excitation and propagation of the activity waves are\nnot well-separated from each other and this, together with the nonlinear nature\nof more-or-less realistic dynamos, suppress the resonances and makes them much\nless pronounced than resonant effects, for example in optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2012 12:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This paper reports research\nthat identifies and explores key issues to enhance the diffusion of online\nretailing in Saudi Arabia. Despite the fact that Saudi Arabia has the largest\nand fastest growth of ICT marketplaces in the Arab region, e-commerce\nactivities are not progressing at the same speed. Only very few Saudi\ncompanies, mostly medium and large companies from the manufacturing sector, are\ninvolved in e-commerce implementation. Based on qualitative data collected by\nconducting interviews with 16 retailers and 16 potential customers in Saudi\nArabia, 7 key drivers to online retailing diffusion in Saudi Arabia are\nidentified. These key drivers are government support, providing trustworthy and\nsecure online payments options, provision of individual house mailboxes,\nproviding high speed Internet connection at low cost, providing educational\nprograms, the success of bricks-and-clicks model, and competitive prices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2012 12:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-13"}
