Using the quasi-linear approximation, we numerically simulated the\npropagation of a beam of accelerated electrons from the solar corona to the\nchromosphere, including the self-consistent response of the inhomogeneous\nbackground plasma in the form of Langmuir waves. We calculated the X-ray\nspectrum from these simulations using the bremsstrahlung cross-section and\nfitted the footpoint spectrum using the collisional \"thick-target\" model, a\nstandard approach adopted in observational studies. We find that the\ninteraction of the Langmuir waves with the background electron density gradient\nshifts the waves to a higher phase velocity where they then resonate with\nhigher velocity electrons. The consequence is that some of the electrons are\nshifted to higher energies, producing more high-energy X-rays than expected if\nthe density inhomogeneity is not considered. We find that the level of energy\ngain is strongly dependent on the initial electron beam density at higher\nenergy and the magnitude of the density gradient in the background plasma. The\nmost significant gains are for steep (soft) spectra that initially had few\nelectrons at higher energies. If the X-ray spectrum of the simulated footpoint\nemission are fitted with the standard \"thick-target\" model (as is routinely\ndone with RHESSI observations) some simulation scenarios produce more than an\norder-of-magnitude overestimate of the number of electrons $>50$keV in the\nsource coronal distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 16:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 16:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In a wireless setting, when a slow fading channel enters a\ndeep fade, the corresponding communication system faces the threat of\nsuccessive decoding failures at the destination. Under such circumstances,\nrapidly getting out of deep fades becomes a priority. Recent advances in fast\nreconfigurable antennas provide new means to alter the statistical profile of\nfading channels and thereby reduce the probability of prolonged fades. Fast\nreconfigurable antennas are therefore poised to improve overall performance,\nespecially for delay-sensitive traffic in slow-fading environments. This\npotential for enhanced performance motivates this study of the temporal\nbehavior of point-to-point communication systems with reconfigurable antennas.\nSpecifically, agile wireless communication schemes over erasure channels are\nanalyzed; situations where using reconfigurable antennas yield substantial\nperformance gains in terms of throughput and average delay are identified.\nScenarios where only partial state information is available at the receiver are\nalso examined, naturally leading to partially observable decision processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 16:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 17:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

By introducing a weak gravitational field into the de Sitter\nspacetime, we find the net force now can be splited into two parts, one is the\ngravitational force due to the induced effective mass between the two plates,\nthe other one is generated by the metric structure of de Sitter spacetime.

Here we describe\nthe detection with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) on the Swift satellite of nine\nwhite dwarf symbiotics that were not previously known to be X-ray sources and\none that had previously been detected as a supersoft X-ray source. The nine new\nX-ray detections were the result of a survey of 41 symbiotic stars, and they\nincrease the number of symbiotic stars known to be X-ray sources by\napproximately 30%. The Swift/XRT telescope detected all of the new X-ray\nsources at energies greater than 2 keV. Their X-ray spectra are consistent with\nthermal emission and fall naturally into three distinct groups. The first group\ncontains those sources with a single, highly absorbed hard component that we\nidentify as probably coming from an accretion-disk boundary layer. The second\ngroup is composed of those sources with a single, soft X-ray spectral component\nthat probably originates in a region where low-velocity shocks produce X-ray\nemission, i.e., a colliding-wind region.\n  The third group consists of those sources with both hard and soft X-ray\nspectral components. We also find that unlike in the optical, where rapid,\nstochastic brightness variations from the accretion disk typically are not\nseen, detectable UV flickering is a common property of symbiotic stars.\nSupporting our physical interpretation of the two X-ray spectral components,\nsimultaneous Swift UV photometry shows that symbiotic stars with harder X-ray\nemission tend to have stronger UV flickering, which is usually associated with\naccretion through a disk.

This sample provides a unique opportunity to\ninvestigate the occurrence of long-term stellar activity cycles for low-mass\nstars. In this paper, we examine the stellar activity of our targets as\nreflected in the H-alpha feature. We have identified periodic signals for 6\nstars, with periods ranging from days to more than 10 years, and find long-term\ntrends for 7 others. Stellar cycles with P > 1 year are present for at least 5%\nof our targets. Additionally, we present an analysis of the time-averaged\nactivity levels of our sample, and search for correlations with other stellar\nproperties. In particular, we find that more massive, earlier type (M0-M2)\nstars tend to be more active than later type dwarfs. Furthermore,\nhigh-metallicity stars tend to be more active at a given stellar mass. We also\nevaluate H-alpha variability as a tracer of activity-induced radial velocity\n(RV) variation. For the M dwarf GJ 1170, H-alpha variation reveals stellar\nactivity patterns matching those seen in the RVs, mimicking the signal of a\ngiant planet, and we find evidence that the previously identified stellar\nactivity cycle of GJ 581 may be responsible for the recently retracted planet f\n(Vogt et al. 2012) in that system. In general, though, we find that H-alpha is\nnot frequently correlated with RV at the precision (typically 6-7 m/s) of our\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 20:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

For stop pairs directly\nproduced from QCD, the visible final-state particles are identical to those of\ntop quark pair production, giving very similar kinematics but often with much\nsmaller rates. The situation is exacerbated for compressed spectra with m(stop)\n~ m(top) + m(LSP), as well as for lighter stops which can suffer from low\nacceptance efficiencies. In this note, we explore the power of a direct stop\nsearch using dileptonic mT2, similar to the one recently performed by ATLAS,\nbut more optimized to cover these difficult regions of the (m(stop),m(LSP))\nplane.

Consequently, ACAD is a true broadband solution to the\nproblem of high-contrast imaging with segmented and/or on-axis apertures. We\nfinally show that once the non-linear solution is found, fine tuning with\nlinear methods used in wavefront control can be applied to further contrast by\nanother order of magnitude.

Here, we give\nevidence that it is computationally hard to decide the answer to this question,\neven if one has access to the power of quantum computation.

By exploiting Knill's\nefficient encoding of a matrix description of a state into a description of a\ncircuit to generate the state, we can show that our promise problem is NP-hard\nwith respect to Cook reductions. Thus, the quantum separability problem (as\nphrased above) constitutes the first nontrivial promise problem decidable by a\ntwo-message quantum interactive proof system while being hard for both NP and\nQSZK.

When a single parameter is set to\nzero, the system consists of two uncoupled Fisher-KPP equations which give rise\nto traveling fronts propagating with the unique, minimal KPP speed. When the\ncoupling parameter is nonzero various behaviors can be observed. Anomalous\nspreading occurs when one component of the system spreads at a speed\nsignificantly faster in the coupled system than it does in isolation, while the\nspeed of the second component remains unchanged. We study these anomalous\nspreading speeds and show that they arise due to poles of the pointwise Green's\nfunction corresponding to the linearizion about the unstable homogeneous state.\nThese poles lead to anomalous spreading in the linearized system and come in\ntwo varieties -- one that persists and leads to anomalous spreading for the\nnonlinear system and one that does not.

Another class of symbiotic systems are those in which the WD is\nextremely luminous and it seems likely that quiescent nuclear burning is\nongoing on the accreting WD. A fundamental question is the secular evolution of\nthe WD. Do the repeated outbursts or quiescent burning in these accreting\nsystems cause the WD to gain or lose mass? If it is gaining mass, can it\neventually reach the Chandrasekhar Limit and become a supernova (a SN Ia if it\ncan hide the hydrogen and helium in the system)? In order to better understand\nthese systems, we have begun a new study of the evolution of Thermonuclear\nRunaways (TNRs) in the accreted envelopes of WDs using a variety of initial WD\nmasses, luminosities and mass accretion rates. We use our 1-D hydro code, NOVA,\nwhich includes the new convective algorithm of Arnett, Meakin and Young, the\nHix and Thielemann nuclear reaction solver, the Iliadis reaction rate library,\nthe Timmes equation of state, and the OPAL opacities.

The main new aspect consists however in\naccounting for charge exchange and ionization of neutral hydrogen, which\nprofoundly change the structure of the shock, as discussed in our previous\nwork. This important dynamical effect of neutrals is mainly associated to the\nso-called neutral return flux, namely the return of hot neutrals from the\ndownstream region to the upstream, where they deposit energy and momentum\nthrough charge exchange and ionization.

Here we analyze the effect of globular cluster\nformation on the observed rest-frame UV luminosity functions (LFs) and UV\ncontinuum slopes of high redshift galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields. We\nfind that the majority of present day globular clusters have formed during two\ndistinct epochs: at redshifts z ~ 2-3 and at redshifts z>~6. The birth of\nproto-GC systems produce the steep, faint-end slopes of the galaxy LFs, and\nbecause the brightness of proto-GCs fades 5 Myrs after their formation, their\nblue colors are in excellent agreement with observations.\n  Our results suggest that: i) the bulk of the old globular cluster population\nwith estimated ages >~12 Gyr (about 50% of the total population), formed in the\nrelatively massive dwarf galaxies at redshifts z>~6; ii) proto-GC formation was\nan important mode of star formation in those dwarf galaxies, and likely\ndominated the reionization process. Another consequence of this scenario is\nthat some of the most massive Milky Way satellites may be faint and yet\nundiscovered because tidal stripping of a dominant GC population precedes\nsignificant stripping of the dark matter halos of these satellites.

On\ninfinite graphs a Gibbs distribution is defined as a suitable limit with the\ncorrect conditional probabilities. In the infinite setting we are interested in\ndetermining when this limit is unique and when there is phase coexistence,\ni.e., existence of multiple Gibbs states. On finite graphs we are interested in\ndetermining the mixing time of local Markov chains.\n  On Z^2 it is conjectured that these problems are related and that both\nundergo a phase transition at some critical point lambda_c approx 3.79. For\nphase coexistence, much of the work to date has focused on the regime of\nuniqueness, with the best result being recent work of Restrepo et al. showing\nthat there is a unique Gibbs state for all lambda < 2.3882. Here we give the\nfirst non-trivial result in the other direction, showing that there are\nmultiple Gibbs states for all lambda > 5.3646. Our proof adds two significant\ninnovations to the standard Peierls argument. First, building on the idea of\nfault lines introduced by Randall, we construct an event that distinguishes two\nboundary conditions and always has long contours associated with it, obviating\nthe need to accurately enumerate short contours. Second, we obtain vastly\nimproved bounds on the number of contours by relating them to a new class of\nself-avoiding walks on an oriented version of Z^2.\n  We extend our characterization of fault lines to show that local Markov\nchains will mix slowly when lambda > 5.3646 on lattice regions with periodic\n(toroidal) boundary conditions and when lambda > 7.1031 with non-periodic\n(free) boundary conditions. The arguments here rely on a careful analysis that\nrelates contours to taxi walks and represent a sevenfold improvement to the\npreviously best known values of \\lambda.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 02:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

We investigate the ability of the second-order\npost-Newtonian TaylorF2 hexagonal template placement metric to construct an\neffectual template bank, if the template waveforms used are effective one body\nwaveforms tuned to numerical relativity (EOBNRv2). We find that by combining\nthe existing TaylorF2 placement metric with EOBNRv2 waveforms, we can construct\nan effectual search for BBHs with component masses in the range 3 Msolar <=\nm_1, m_2 <= 25 Msolar.

Based on the Virialization assumption and\nthe empirical relation about $R_{BLR}$, one strong negative correlation of line\nparameters of the double-peaked broad lines should be expected for 3C390.3,\nsuch as the negative correlation confirmed for the mapped broad line object\nNGC5548.

In the context of the\nproposed theoretical accretion disk model for double-peaked emitters, the\nunexpected positive correlation can be naturally explained, due to different\ntime delays for inner parts and outer parts of disk-like BLR of 3C390.3.\nMoreover, the Virialization assumption is checked and found to be still\navailable for 3C390.3. However, time-varying size of the BLR of 3C390.3 can not\nbe expected by the empirical relation $R_{BLR}\\propto L^{\\sim0.5}$, the\ncontinuum emission strengthening leads to the size of BLR decreasing (not\nincreasing) in different moments for 3C390.3.

In addition, surveys\nhave non-trivial geometries, which make the interpretation of the observations\neven trickier, but the uncertainty can nevertheless be worked out within the\nGaussian approximation. With the recent realization that Gaussian treatments of\nthe power spectrum lead to biased error bars about the dilation of the baryonic\nacoustic oscillation scale, efforts are being directed towards developing\nnon-Gaussian analyses, mainly from N-body simulations so far. Unfortunately,\nthere is currently no way to tell how the non-Gaussian features observed in the\nsimulations compare to those of the real Universe, and it is generally hard to\ntell at what level of accuracy the N-body simulations can model complicated\nnon-linear effects such as mode coupling and galaxy bias.

The energy-saving\nconcept studied in this paper is the adaptation of a base station's (BS's)\ntransmit power levels and coverage area according to channel conditions and\ntraffic load. The traffic load in cellular networks exhibits significant\nfluctuations in both space and time, which can be exploited, through cell range\nadaptation, for energy saving. In this paper, we design short- and long-term BS\npower control (STPC and LTPC respectively) policies for the OFDMA-based\ndownlink of a single-cell system, where bandwidth is dynamically and equally\nshared among a random number of mobile users (MUs). STPC is a function of all\nMUs' channel gains that maintains the required user-level quality of service\n(QoS), while LTPC (including BS on-off control) is a function of traffic\ndensity that minimizes the long-term energy consumption at the BS under a\nminimum throughput constraint. We first develop a power scaling law that\nrelates the (short-term) average transmit power at BS with the given cell range\nand MU density. Based on this result, we derive the optimal (long-term)\ntransmit adaptation policy by considering a joint range adaptation and LTPC\nproblem. By identifying the fact that energy saving at BS essentially comes\nfrom two major energy saving mechanisms (ESMs), i.e. range adaptation and BS\non-off power control, we propose low-complexity suboptimal schemes with various\ncombinations of the two ESMs to investigate their impacts on system energy\nconsumption. It is shown that when the network throughput is low, BS on-off\npower control is the most effective ESM, while when the network throughput is\nhigher, range adaptation becomes more effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 08:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 10:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2013 13:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

It is obvious\nthat vehicles are distributed non-homogeneously along a road segment due to\ntraffic controls and speed limits at different portions of the road. The common\nassumption of homogeneous node distribution in the network in most of the\nprevious work in mobile ad-hoc networks thus appears to be inappropriate in\nVANETs. In light of the inadequacy, we present in this paper an original\nmethodology to study the performance of VANETs with practical vehicle\ndistribution in urban environment. Specifically, we introduce the stochastic\ntraffic model to characterize the general vehicular traffic flow as well as the\nrandomness of individual vehicles, from which we can acquire the mean dynamics\nand the probability distribution of vehicular density. As illustrative\nexamples, we demonstrate how the density knowledge from the stochastic traffic\nmodel can be utilized to derive the throughput and progress performance of\nthree routing strategies in different channel access protocols. We confirm the\naccuracy of the analytical results through extensive simulations. Our results\ndemonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology on modeling protocol\nperformance, and shed insight into the performance analysis of other\ntransmission protocols and network configurations in vehicular networks.\nFurthermore, we illustrate that the optimal transmission probability for\noptimized network performance can be obtained as a function of the location\nspace from our results. Such information can be computed by road-side nodes and\nthen broadcasted to road users for optimized multi-hop packet transmission in\nthe communication network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 09:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}

The time\nrequired to reduce the visible albedo of samples to ~ 0.05 is ~ 1 Myr. Since\nboth these timescales are much less than the average collisional lifetime of\nasteroids larger than several kilometers in size, numerous low-albedo asteroids\nhaving reddish spectra with subdued absorption bands should be observed instead\nof an S-type dominated population.

This allows direct comparisons of performance of the new functional\nrelative to the standard one.

For this model, we show that\ncyclotron line modeling erroneously leads to describing part of the exponential\ncutoff and the continuum variability, and not the cyclotron lines. When the\nX-ray continuum is modeled with a simple exponentially cutoff power law\nmodified by a Gaussian emission feature around 10keV, the correlation between\nthe line energy and the flux vanishes and the line parameters remain virtually\nconstant over the outburst. We therefore conclude that the previously reported\nanti-correlation is an artifact of the assumptions adopted in the modeling of\nthe continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 13:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Imaging polarimetry\noffers a way to decrease the contrast between the unpolarized starlight and the\nlight that has become linearly polarized after scattering by circumstellar\nmaterial. This material can be the dust and debris found in circumstellar\ndisks, but also the atmosphere or surface of an exoplanet. We present the\ndesign, calibration approach, polarimetric performance and sample observation\nresults of the Extreme Polarimeter, an imaging polarimeter for the study of\ncircumstellar environments in scattered light at visible wavelengths. The\npolarimeter uses the beam-exchange technique, in which the two orthogonal\npolarization states are imaged simultaneously and a polarization modulator\nswaps the polarization states of the two beams before the next image is taken.\nThe instrument currently operates without the aid of Adaptive Optics. To reduce\nthe effects of atmospheric seeing on the polarimetry, the images are taken at a\nframe rate of 35 fps, and large numbers of frames are combined to obtain the\npolarization images. Four successful observing runs have been performed using\nthis instrument at the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, targeting\nyoung stars with protoplanetary disks as well as evolved stars surrounded by\ndusty envelopes. In terms of fractional polarization, the instrument\nsensitivity is better than 10^-4. The contrast achieved between the central\nstar and the circumstellar source is of the order 10^-6.

Upon cooling in zero magnetic field through the ferromagnetic\ntransition, the dramatic drop in the linear resistivity at the upper transition\n$T_{c_1}$ coincides with the onset of nonlinearity, and upon further cooling is\nfollowed by a pronounced peak in $V_{3 \\omega}$ at the lower transition\n$T_{c_2}$.

It is believed that, by its very\nvirtue, transactional memory must ensure that all committed transactions\nconstitute a serial execution respecting the real-time order. In contrast,\naborted or incomplete transactions should not \"take effect.\" But what does \"not\ntaking effect\" mean exactly?\n  It seems natural to expect that aborted or incomplete transactions do not\nappear in the global serial execution, and, thus, no committed transaction can\nbe affected by them. We investigate another, less obvious, feature of \"not\ntaking effect\" called non-interference: aborted or incomplete transactions\nshould not force any other transaction to abort. In the strongest form of\nnon-interference that we explore in this paper, by removing a subset of aborted\nor incomplete transactions from the history, we should not be able to turn an\naborted transaction into a committed one without violating the correctness\ncriterion.\n  We show that non-interference is, in a strict sense, not implementable with\nrespect to the popular criterion of opacity that requires all transactions (be\nthey committed, aborted or incomplete) to witness the same global serial\nexecution. In contrast, when we only require local correctness,\nnon-interference is implementable. Informally, a correctness criterion is local\nif it only requires that every transaction can be serialized along with (a\nsubset of) the transactions committed before its last event (aborted or\nincomplete transactions ignored). We give a few examples of local correctness\nproperties, including the recently proposed criterion of virtual world\nconsistency, and present a simple though efficient implementation that\nsatisfies non-interference and local opacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 14:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 22:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2013 12:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 13:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2013 12:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

As in networks from real applications, coupled cell networks can\nrepresent inhomogeneous networks where different types of cells interact with\neach other in different ways, which can be represented graphically by different\nsymbols, or abstractly by equivalence relations.\n  Various synchronous behaviors, from full synchrony to partial synchrony, can\nbe observed for a given network. Patterns of synchrony, which do not depend on\nspecific dynamics of the network, but only on the network structure, are\nassociated with a special type of partition of cells, termed balanced\nequivalence relations. Algorithms in Aldis (2008) and Belykh and Hasler (2011)\nfind the unique pattern of synchrony with the least clusters. In this paper, we\ncompute the set of all possible patterns of synchrony and show their hierarchy\nstructure as a complete lattice.\n  We represent the network structure of a given coupled cell network by a\nsymbolic adjacency matrix encoding the different coupling types. We show that\nbalanced equivalence relations can be determined by a matrix computation on the\nadjacency matrix which forms a block structure for each balanced equivalence\nrelation. This leads to a computer algorithm to search for all possible\nbalanced equivalence relations. Our computer program outputs the balanced\nequivalence relations, quotient matrices, and a complete lattice for user\nspecified coupled cell networks. Finding the balanced equivalence relations of\nany network of up to 15 nodes is tractable, but for larger networks this\ndepends on the pattern of synchrony with least clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 15:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-07"}

Whilst CCPs can have major operational positives, we argue that CCPs\nhave many of the business characteristics of Rating Agencies, and face similar\nbusiness pressures. Thus we see a risk that prices from CCPs may develop the\ncharacteristics attributed to ratings from Rating Agency pre-crisis. Business\nover-reliance on ratings of questionable accuracy is seen as a cause of the\nfinancial crisis. We see the potential for same situation to be repeated with\nprices from CCPs.
