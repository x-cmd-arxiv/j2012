Perturbations can be applied to each trajectory independently (white\nnoise) or simultaneously to all trajectories (random map). We compare these two\nscenarios by generalizing the theory of open chaotic systems and introducing a\ntime-dependent conditionally-map-invariant measure. For the same perturbation\nstrength we show that the escape rate of the random map is always larger than\nthat of the noisy map. In random maps we show that the escape rate $\\kappa$ and\ndimensions $D$ of the relevant fractal sets often depend nonmonotonically on\nthe intensity of the random perturbation. We discuss the accuracy (bias) and\nprecision (variance) of finite-size estimators of $\\kappa$ and $D$, and show\nthat the improvement of the precision of the estimations with the number of\ntrajectories $N$ is extremely slow ($\\propto 1/\\ln N$).

A few protocols have been\nproposed for frequency allocation in such networks, however they do not address\nthe problem end-to-end. In this paper, we present a general formulation of the\nchannel selection problem taking into account the performance of both\nmesh-access and mesh-backhaul. Moreover, we propose ARACHNE, a routing-aware\nchannel selection protocol for wireless mesh networks. ARACHNE is distributed\nin nature, and motivated by our measurements on a wireless testbed. The main\nnovelty of our protocol comes from adopting a metric that captures the\nend-to-end link loads across different routes in the network. ARACHNE\nprioritizes the assignment of low-interference channels to links that (a) need\nto serve high-load aggregate traffic and/or (b) already suffer significant\nlevels of contention and interference. Our protocol takes into account the\nnumber of potential interfaces (radios) per device, and allocates these\ninterfaces in a manner that efficiently utilizes the available channel\ncapacity. We evaluate ARACHNE through extensive, tracedriven simulations and we\nshow that approaches the optimal channel selection.

We calculated more than 3000 stellar tracks and\nisochrones, with updated solar mixture, by changing the following physical\ninputs within their current range of uncertainty: 1H(p,nu e+)2H,\n14N(p,gamma)15O, and triple-alpha reaction rates, radiative and conductive\nopacities, neutrino energy losses, and microscopic diffusion velocities. We\nperformed a systematic variation on a fixed grid, in a way to obtain a full\ncrossing of the perturbed input values. The effect of the variations of the\nchosen physical inputs on relevant stellar evolutionary features, such as the\nturn-off luminosity, the central hydrogen exhaustion time, the red-giant branch\n(RGB) tip luminosity, the helium core mass, and the ZAHB luminosity in the RR\nLyrae region are statistically analyzed.

The expected isomeric lifetime is $\\tau=$\n3-5 hours, leading to an extremely sharp relative linewidth of Delta E/E ~\n10^-20, 5-6 orders of magnitude smaller than typical atomic relative\nlinewidths. For an adequately chosen electronic state the frequency of the\nnuclear ground-state transition will be independent from influences of external\nfields in the framework of the linear Zeeman and quadratic Stark effect,\nrendering 229mTh a candidate for a reference of an optical clock with very high\naccuracy.

Here we describe a sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery approach\ncalled Doppler focusing which addresses all of these problems: it performs low\nrate sampling and digital processing, imposes no restrictions on the\ntransmitter, and uses a CS dictionary with size which does not increase with\nincreasing number of pulses P. Furthermore, in the presence of noise, Doppler\nfocusing enjoys an SNR increase which scales linearly with P, obtaining good\ndetection performance even at SNRs as low as -25dB. The recovery is based on\nthe Xampling framework, which allows reducing the number of samples needed to\naccurately represent the signal, directly in the analog-to-digital conversion\nprocess. After sampling, the entire digital recovery process is performed on\nthe low rate samples without having to return to the Nyquist rate.

The algorithm mimics the principles of bat sonar in finding\nits targets. The algorithm introduces three search approaches. The first search\napproach considers a single sonar unit (SSU) with a fixed beam length and a\nsingle starting point. In this approach, although the results converge toward\nthe optimum fitness, it is not guaranteed to find the global optimum solution\nespecially for complex problems; it is satisfied with finding 'acceptably good'\nsolutions to these problems. The second approach considers multisonar units\n(MSU) working in parallel in the same state space. Each unit has its own\nstarting point and tries to find the optimum solution. In this approach the\nprobability that the algorithm converges toward the optimum solution is\nsignificantly increased. It is found that this approach is suitable for complex\nfunctions and for problems of wide state space. In the third approach, a single\nsonar unit with a moment (SSM) is used in order to handle the problem of\nconvergence toward a local optimum rather than a global optimum. The momentum\nterm is added to the length of the transmitted beams. This will give the chance\nto find the best fitness in a wider range within the state space. In this paper\na comparison between the proposed algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) has been\nmade. It showed that both of the algorithms can catch approximately the optimum\nsolutions for all of the testbed functions except for the function that has a\nlocal minimum, in which the proposed algorithm's result is much better than\nthat of the GA algorithm.

With this\ndefinition of clustering, we show the existence of a size threshold of (\\ln\nn)^{1/2} for the existence of clusters in the CGA model. For all \\epsilon>0,\na.a.s. clusters larger than (\\ln n)^{1/2-\\epsilon} exist, whereas a.a.s.\nclusters larger than (\\ln n)^{1/2+\\epsilon} do not exist. Moreover, we show a\nsize bound on the existence of small, constant-size clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 00:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

The APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL) is the\nfirst systematic survey of the inner Galactic plane in the sub-millimetre. The\nobservations were carried out with the Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA), an\narray of 295 bolometers observing at 870 microns (345 GHz). Aims. Here we\npresent a first version of the compact source catalogue extracted from this\nsurvey. This catalogue provides an unbiased database of dusty clumps in the\ninner Galaxy. Methods. The construction of this catalogue was made using the\nsource extraction routine SExtractor. We have cross-associated the obtained\nsources with the IRAS and MSX catalogues, in order to constrain their nature.\nResults. We have detected 6639 compact sources in the range from 330 < l < 21\ndegrees and |b| < 1.5 degrees. The catalogue has a 99% completeness for sources\nwith a peak flux above 6 sigma, which corresponds to a flux density of ~0.4\nJy/beam. The parameters extracted for sources with peak fluxes below the 6\nsigma completeness threshold should be used with caution. Tests on simulated\ndata find the uncertainty in the flux measurement to be ~12%, however, in more\ncomplex regions the flux values can be overestimated by a factor of 2 due to\nthe additional background emission. Using a search radius of 30\" we found that\n40% of ATLASGAL compact sources are associated with an IRAS or MSX point\nsource, but, ~50% are found to be associated with MSX 21 microns fluxes above\nthe local background level, which is probably a lower limit to the actual\nnumber of sources associated with star formation. Conclusions. Although\ninfrared emission is found towards the majority of the clumps detected, this\ncatalogue is still likely to include a significant number of clumps that are\ndevoid of star formation activity and therefore excellent candidates for\nobjects in the coldest, earliest stages of (high-mass) star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 01:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Using the classic\nfluid dynamic solution for flow around a circular cylinder with an MHD\ncorrection, the compression of the prominence material can be estimated.

One possibility is that a substantial\nfraction of the Galaxy's baryons are embedded within an extended,\nmillion-degree hot halo, an idea supported indirectly by observations of warm\ngas clouds in the halo and gas-free dwarf spheroidal satellites. X-ray\nobservations have established that hot gas does exist in our Galaxy beyond the\nlocal hot bubble; however, it may be distributed in a hot disk configuration.\nMoreover, recent investigations into the X-ray constraints have suggested that\nany Galactic corona must be insignificant.

Because of the spin-orbit coupling, rich spin-orbital\ncoupled textures can exist both in momentum and in real space. For three\ndimensional topological insulators in the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family, topological\nsurface states with p$_z$ orbitals have a left-handed spin texture for the\nupper Dirac cone and a right-handed spin texture for the lower Dirac cone. In\nthis work, we predict a new form of the spin-orbital texture associated with\nthe p$_x$ and p$_y$ orbitals.

The calculations are performed within a factorization\napproximation, in which the full production amplitude is written as a product\nof the amplitudes for the $K^- + p \\to K^+ + \\Xi^-$ and $\\Xi^- + p \\to H$\nprocesses. The $K^+\\Xi^-$ production vertex is described by excitation,\npropagation and decay of $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma$ resonance states in the initial\ncollision of a $K^-$ meson with a target proton in the incident channel. The\nparameters of the resonance vertices are taken to be the same as those\ndetermined previously by describing the available data on total and\ndifferential cross sections for the $p(K^-, K^+)\\Xi^-$ reaction within a\nsimilar model. The $\\Xi^- + p \\to H$ fusion process is treated within a quark\nmodel where the $H$ dibaryon is considered as a stable particle. For the $K^+$\nmeson angle fixed at 0$^o$, the $H$ production cross-section is found to be\nabout 2.9 $\\mu b/sr$ for $H$ mass just below the $\\Lambda \\Lambda$ threshold at\na $K^-$ beam momentum of 1.67 GeV/c. This is an order of magnitude larger than\nthe value for this quantity reported earlier in calculations performed on a\n$^3$He target using a different model for the cascade hyperon production. We\nhave also calculated the beam momentum dependence of the $H$ production cross\nsection and the energy spectrum of the emitted $K^+$ meson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 07:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 12:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}

First, we quantify the length scale\nof the dynamic heterogeneities utilizing the four-point correlation function.\nThe growth of the dynamic length scale with decreasing temperature is\ncharacterized by various scaling relations that are analogous to the critical\nphenomena. We also examine how the growth of the length scale depends upon the\nmodel employed. Second, the four-point correlation function is extended to a\nthree-time correlation function to characterize the temporal structures of the\ndynamic heterogeneities based on our previous studies. We provide comprehensive\nnumerical results obtained from the three-time correlation function for the\nabove models. From these calculations, we examine the time scale of the dynamic\nheterogeneities and determine the associated lifetime in a consistent and\nsystematic way. Our results indicate that the lifetime of the dynamical\nheterogeneities becomes much longer than the alpha relaxation time determined\nfrom a two-point correlation function in fragile liquids. The decoupling\nbetween the two time scales is remarkable, particularly in supercooled states,\nand the time scales differ by more than an order of magnitude in a more fragile\nliquid.

The part of the\nstrain energy which involves the shear phenomenon is expressed in function of\nthe warping functions and their derivatives. The variational calculus leads to\na differential system of equations which warping functions must verify. Solving\nthis system requires the choice of values for the (global) shear strains and\ntheir derivatives. A particular choice, which is justified for cross-ply\nlaminates, leads to excellent results. For single layer isotropic and\northotropic plates, an analytical expression of the warping functions is given.\nThey involve hyperbolic trigonometric functions. They differ from the z - 4/3z3\nReddy's formula which has been found to be a limit of present warping functions\nfor isotropic and moderately thick plates. When the h/L and/or the G13/E1\nratios significantly differ from those of isotropic and moderately thick\nplates, a difference between present warping functions and Reddy's formula can\nbe observed, even for the isotropic single layer plate. Finite element\nsimulations agree perfectly with the present warping functions in these cases.\nFor multilayer cross-ply configurations, the warping functions are determined\nusing a semi-analytical procedure. They have been compared to results of 3D\nfinite element simulations. They are in excellent agreement. For angle-ply\nlaminates, the above process gives warping functions that seem to have relevant\nshapes, even if the choice for global shear values cannot be justified in this\ncase. No finite element comparison has been presented at this time because it\nis difficult to propose boundary conditions and prescribed load that permit to\nisolate the shear phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 07:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

The analysis of 12 galaxy clusters with excellent\ntotal masses shows a tight correlation between the stellar mass, or stellar\nfraction, and total mass within r500 with negligible intrinsic scatter: the 90%\nupper limit is 0.06 dex, the posterior mean is 0.027 dex.

Three-quarters of the studied clusters have lgM\n<~14 Msol, which is advantageous from a cosmological perspective because these\nclusters are far more abundant than more massive clusters.

It should be stressed that this follows directly form\nthe quantum HJ equation without any axiomatic assumption concerning the\nstandard formulation of quantum mechanics. This provides a stringent connection\nbetween the quantum HJ equation and the Copenhagen interpretation. Together\nwith tunneling and the energy quantization theorem for confining potentials,\nformulated in the framework of quantum HJ equation, it leads to the main\nfeatures of the axioms of quantum mechanics from a unique geometrical\nprinciple. Similarly to the case of the classical HJ equation, this fixes its\nquantum analog by requiring that there exist point transformations, rather than\ncanonical ones, leading to the trivial hamiltonian. This is equivalent to a\nbasic cocycle condition on the states. Such a cocycle condition can be\nimplemented on compact spaces, so that continuous energy spectra are allowed\nonly as a limiting case. Remarkably, a compact space would also imply that the\nDirac and von Neumann formulations of quantum mechanics essentially coincide.\nWe suggest that there is a definition of time parameterisation leading to\ntrajectories in the context of the quantum HJ equation having the probabilistic\ninterpretation of the Copenhagen School.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 09:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2013 15:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

We measured the sky-projected obliquity lambda = 24 (+17/-9) degrees,\nindicating that WASP-52b orbits in the same direction as its host star is\nrotating and that this prograde orbit is slightly misaligned with the stellar\nequator. These four new planetary systems increase our statistics on hot\njupiters, and provide new targets for follow-up studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 10:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The imaginary part of the potential\nLove number of the body, which is directly related to the rates of energy and\nangular momentum exchange in the tidal interaction and to the rate of\ndissipation of energy, may have a complicated dependence on the tidal\nfrequency. However, a certain frequency-average of this quantity is independent\nof the dissipative properties of the fluid and can be determined by means of an\nimpulse calculation. The result is a strongly increasing function of the size\nof the core when the tidal potential is a sectoral harmonic, especially when\nthe body is not strongly centrally condensed.

Predictions for the peak-to-total and peak-to-background ratios are\ngiven at 1.3 MeV for the addback mode of operation. The application of the\nformalism to clover germanium detector is discussed in two separate papers (R.\nKshetri, JINST 2012 7 P07008; ibid., P08015). Using the basic approach\ndeveloped in those papers, for the first time we present a procedure for\ncalculating the peak-to-total ratio of the cluster detector for gamma-energies\nup to 8 MeV. Results are shown for both bare and suppressed detectors as well\nas for the single crystal and addback modes of operation.

The CO line\nshows a skewed profile with very broad and asymmetric wings detected out to\nvelocities of -600 km/s and +800 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity.\nThe PdBI maps reveal the existence of two prominent structures of blueshifted\nCO emission.

For the evolutionary analysis of the sources we\nused the millimeter continuum emission from Beltran et al (2006) and the\ninfrared emission from the MSX Point Source Catalogue. We detect centimeter\ncontinuum emission in 88% of the observed fields with a typical rms noise level\nof 0.45mJy/beam. Most of the fields show a single radio continuum source, while\nin 20% of them we identify multiple components. A total of 214 centimeter\ncontinuum sources have been identified, likely tracing optically thin HII\nregions, with physical parameters typical of both extended and compact HII\nregions. Water maser emission was detected in 41% of the regions, resulting in\na total of 85 distinct components. The low angular (20arcsec) and spectral\n(14km/s) resolutions do not allow a proper analysis of the water maser\nemission, but suffice to investigate its association with the continuum\nsources. We have also studied the detection rate of HII regions in the two\ntypes of IRAS sources defined by Palla et (1991) on the basis of the IRAS\ncolours: High and Low. No significant differences are found, with large\ndetection rates (>90%) for both High and Low sources. We classify the\nmillimeter and infrared sources in our fields in three evolutionary stages\nfollowing the scheme presented by ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 12:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The systematic investigation reveals that\npolymer swelling is maximal if both monomer-monomer and monomer-cosolute\ninteractions are weakly attractive. In the most swollen state the cosolute\ndensity inside the coil is remarkably bulk-like and homogenous. Highly\nattractive monomer-cosolute interactions, however, are found to induce a\ncollapse of the chain which, in contrast to the collapsed case induced by\npurely repulsive cosolvents, exhibits a considerably enhanced cosolute density\nwithin the globule. Thus, collapsed states, although appearing similar on a\nfirst glance, may result from very different mechanisms with distinct final\nstructural and thermodynamics properties. Two theoretical models, one based on\nan effective one-component description where the cosolutes have been integrated\nout, and a fully two-component Flory -- de Gennes like model, support the\nsimulation findings above and serve for interpretation. In particular, the\npicture is supported that collapse in highly attractive cosolvents is driven by\ncrosslinking-like bridging effects, while the ratio of attraction width to\ncosolute size plays a critical role behind this mechanism. Only if\npolymer-cosolute interactions are not too short-ranged swelling effects should\nbe observable.

In the noise-free setting we derive a general expression on the\nnumber of measurements needed to ensure that a unique solution can be found in\na stable way, that depends on the set T through a natural complexity parameter.\nThis parameter can be computed explicitly for many sets T of interest. For\nexample, for k-sparse inputs we show that O(k\\log(n/k)) measurements are\nneeded, and when x can be any vector in R^n, O(n) measurements suffice.

The process has been monitored by\nfollowing the behavior of the adsorption isotherms for different values of\nlateral interaction energy/temperature. The numerical data were compared with\nmean-field analytical predictions and exact functions for noninteracting and 1D\nsystems. The obtained results revealed the existence of three adsorption\nregimes in temperature. (1) At high temperatures, above the critical one\ncharacterizing the IN transition at full coverage Tc(\\theta=1), the particles\nare distributed at random on the surface and the adlayer behaves as a\nnoninteracting 2D system. (2) At very low temperatures, the asymmetric monomers\nadsorb forming chains over almost the entire range of coverage, and the\nadsorption process behaves as a 1D problem. (3) In the intermediate regime, the\nsystem exhibits a mixed regime and the filling of the lattice proceeds\naccording to two different processes. In the first stage, the monomers adsorb\nisotropically on the lattice until the IN transition occurs in the system and,\nfrom this point, particles adsorb forming chains so that the adlayer behaves as\na 1D fluid. The two adsorption processes are present in the adsorption\nisotherms, and a marked singularity can be observed that separates both\nregimes. Thus, the adsorption isotherms appear as sensitive quantities with\nrespect to the IN phase transition, allowing us (i) to reproduce the phase\ndiagram of the system for square lattices and (ii) to obtain an accurate\ndetermination of the phase diagram for triangular lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 15:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

Since then, these ideas have been\noperationalized further and applied. Particularly relevant have been the\nrecourse to extended peer review, to be intended as internal, across\ndisciplines, as well as external, between practitioners and stakeholders, and\nthe use of a new approach to qualify quantities: NUSAP (Numeral, Unit, Spread,\nAssessment, Pedigree). Here we describe how sensitivity analysis, mandated by\nexisting guidelines as a good practice to use in conjunction to mathematical\nmodelling, needs to be transformed and adapted to ensure quality in the\ntreatment of uncertainty of science for policy. We thus provide seven rules to\nextend the use of sensitivity analysis (or how to apportion uncertainty in\nmodel based inference among input factors) in a process of sensitivity auditing\nof models used in a policy context. Each rule will be illustrated by examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 18:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

For this purpose, we use the\nsquared sound speed $v_s^2$ whose sign determines the stability of the model.\nWe explore the stability of this model in the presence/absence of interaction\nbetween dark energy and dark matter in both flat and non-flat geometry. In all\ncases we find almost a same result. Based on the square sound speed analysis,\ndue to the existence of a free parameter in this model, the model is\ntheoretically capable to lead a dark energy dominated stable universe. However,\nobservational constraints rule out such a chance. In conclusion, we find\nevidences that the generalized ghost dark energy might can not lead to a stable\nuniverse favored by observations at the present time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 17:09:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 02:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
