From the\nenergetic point of view, supernova remnants (SNRs) remain the most plausible\nsources of CRs up to rigidity ? 10^6-10^7 GV. This confidence somehow resulted\nin the construction of a paradigm, the so-called SNR paradigm: CRs are\naccelerated through diffusive shock acceleration in SNRs and propagate\ndiffusively in the Galaxy in an energy dependent way. Qualitative confirmation\nof the SNR acceleration scenario has recently been provided by gamma ray and\nX-ray observations. Diffusive propagation in the Galaxy is probed\nobservationally through measurement of the secondary to primary nuclei flux\nratios (such as B/C). There are however some weak points in the paradigm, which\nsuggest that we are probably missing some physical ingredients in our models.\nThe theory of diffusive shock acceleration at SNR shocks predicts spectra of\naccelerated particles which are systematically too hard compared with the ones\ninferred from gamma ray observations. Moreover, hard injection spectra\nindirectly imply a steep energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient in the\nGalaxy, which in turn leads to anisotropy larger than the observed one.\nMoreover recent measurements of the flux of nuclei suggest that the spectra\nhave a break at rigidity ? 200 GV, which does not sit well with the common\nwisdom in acceleration and propagation.

Comparing the radio emission to the shock properties implies that\napproximately 0.2% of the dissipated shock kinetic energy goes into\naccelerating relativistic electrons. This is an order of magnitude smaller than\nthe efficiency of shock acceleration in many Galactic supernova remnants, which\nmay be due to the lower Mach numbers of cluster merger shocks.

Several high-quality\ntime series of disc-centre, quiet-Sun observations from the Sunrise\nballoon-borne solar telescope, with spatial resolution of around 100 km on the\nsolar surface, have been analysed to study the dynamics of BPs observed in the\nCa II H passband and their dependence on the photospheric vector magnetogram\nsignal. Parameters such as horizontal velocity, diameter, intensity and\nlifetime histograms of the isolated internetwork and magnetic Ca II H BPs were\ndetermined. Mean values were found to be 2.2 km/s, 0.2 arcsec (150 km), 1.48\naverage Ca II H quiet-Sun and 673 sec, respectively. Interestingly, the\nbrightness and the horizontal velocity of BPs are anti-correlated. Large\nexcursions (pulses) in horizontal velocity, up to 15 km/s, are present in the\ntrajectories of most BPs. These could excite kink waves travelling into the\nchromosphere and possibly the corona, which we estimate to carry an energy flux\nof 310 W/m^2, sufficient to heat the upper layers, although only marginally.\nThe stable observing conditions of Sunrise and our technique for identifying\nand tracking BPs have allowed us to determine reliable parameters of these\nfeatures in the internetwork. Thus we find, e.g., that they are considerably\nlonger lived than previously thought. The large velocities are also reliable,\nand may excite kink waves. Although these wave are (marginally) energetic\nenough to heat the quiet corona, we expect a large additional contribution from\nlarger magnetic elements populating the network and partly also the\ninternetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 19:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

We have combined the Herschel results with ground-based,\nSpitzer, and WISE observations to construct spectral energy distributions for\nall of the targets. For the two dwarf novae in the sample, SS Cyg and U Gem, we\nfind that their infrared luminosities are completely dominated by their\nsecondary stars. For the two highly magnetic \"polars\" in our survey, AM Her and\nEF Eri, we find that their mid-infrared excesses, previously attributed to\ncircumbinary dust emission, can be fully explained by cyclotron emission. The\nWISE light curves for both sources show large, orbitally modulated variations\nthat are identically phased to their near-IR light curves. We propose that\nsignificant emission from the lowest cyclotron harmonics (n </= 3) is present\nin EF Eri and AM Her. Previously, such emission would have been presumed to be\noptically thick, and not provide significant orbitally modulated flux. This\nsuggests that the accretion onto polars is more complicated than assumed in the\nsimple models developed for these two sources. We develop a model for the\nnear-/mid-IR light curves for WZ Sge with an L2 donor star that shows that the\nellipsoidal variations from its secondary star are detected. We conclude that\nnone of the targets surveyed have dusty circumbinary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 19:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In particular, we investigate the\nmagnetospheric ejections (MEs) due to the expansion and reconnection of the\nfield lines connecting the star with the disk. Our aim is to study the\ndynamical properties of the outflows and evaluate their impact on the angular\nmomentum evolution of young protostars. Our models are based on axisymmetric\ntime-dependent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of the\ndipolar magnetosphere of a rotating protostar with a viscous and resistive\ndisk, using alpha prescriptions for the transport coefficients. Our simulations\nare designed in order to model: the accretion process and the formation of\naccretion funnels; the periodic inflation/reconnection of the magnetosphere and\nthe associated MEs; the stellar wind. Similarly to a magnetic slingshot, MEs\ncan be powered by the rotation of both the disk and the star so that they can\nefficiently remove angular momentum from both. Depending on the accretion rate,\nMEs can extract a relevant fraction of the accretion torque and, together with\na weak but non-negligible stellar wind torque, can balance the spin-up due to\naccretion. When the disk truncation approaches the corotation radius, the\nsystem enters a \"propeller\" regime, where the torques exerted by the disk and\nthe MEs can even balance the spin-up due to the stellar contraction. The MEs\nspin-down efficiency can be compared to other scenarios, such as the Ghosh &\nLamb, X-wind or stellar wind models. Nevertheless, for all scenarios, an\nefficient spin-down torque requires a rather strong dipolar component, which\nhas been seldom observed in classical T Tauri stars. A better analysis of the\ntorques acting on the protostar must take into account non-axisymmetric and\nmultipolar magnetic components consistent with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 19:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Studying the variability in\nthese BALs allows us to further our understanding of the structure, evolution,\nand basic physical properties of the outflows. This is the third paper in a\nseries on a monitoring programme of 24 luminous BAL quasars at redshifts 1.2 <\nz < 2.9. We focus here on the time-scales of variability in CIV 1549A BALs in\nour full multi-epoch sample, which covers time-scales from 0.02-8.7 yr in the\nquasar rest-frame. Our sample contains up to 13 epochs of data per quasar, with\nan average of 7 epochs per quasar.

Observed variations in only portions\nof BAL troughs or in lines that are optically thick suggest that at least some\nof these changes are caused by clouds (or some type of outflow substructures)\nmoving across our lines of sight. In this crossing cloud scenario, the\nvariability times constrain both the crossing speeds and the absorber\nlocations. Typical variability times of order ~1 year indicate crossing speeds\nof a few thousand km/s and radial distances near ~1 pc from the central black\nhole.

It is well known that if two metrics $g_0$, $g_1$ of positive scalar\ncurvature on a closed compact manifold $M$ are psc-isotopic, then they are\npsc-concordant: i.e., there exists a metric $\\bar{g}$ of positive scalar\ncurvature on the cylinder $M\\times I$ which extends the metrics $g_0$ on\n$M\\times {0}$ and $g_1$ on $M\\times {1}$ and is a product metric near the\nboundary.

The derivative of a higher-order function $f$ that\nreturns a function $g$ will be a function $f'$ that returns a function\n$\\bar{g}$ that performs a derivative calculation.

We have\nspatially resolved a debris disk around the remarkable M3-type star GJ581\nhosting multiple planets using deep PACS images at 70, 100 and 160 microns as\npart of the DEBRIS Program on the Herschel Space Observatory. This is the\nsecond spatially resolved debris disk found around an M-type star, after the\none surrounding the young star AU Mic (12 Myr).

We fit an axisymmetric model\nof the disk to the three PACS images and found that the best fit model is for a\ndisk extending radially from 25+/-12 AU to more than 60 AU.

There has been a long-standing controversy in the tree\nphysiology literature over precisely what mechanism drives sap exudation, and\nwe aim to cast light on this issue. Our model is based on the work of Milburn\nand O'Malley [Can. J. Bot., 62(10):2101-2106, 1984] who hypothesized that\nelevated sap pressures derive from compressed gas that is trapped within\ncertain wood cells and subsequently released when frozen sap thaws in the\nspring.

We derive a system of differential-algebraic equations based on\nconservation principles that is used to test the validity of the\nMilburn-O'Malley hypothesis and also to determine the extent to which osmosis\nis required.

In this formulation, the wavefront sensor\nmeasurements provide a means to jointly estimate the static speckle and the\nplanetary signal. The ability to estimate planetary intensities in as little as\nfew seconds has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of exoplanet\nsearch surveys. Unlike currently used methods, in which increasing the\nobservation time beyond a certain threshold is useless, this method produces\nestimates whose error covariances decrease more quickly than inversely\nproportional to the observation time. This is due to the fact that the\nestimates of the quasi-static aberrations are informed by a new random (but\napproximately known) wavefront every millisecond. The method can be extended to\ninclude angular (due to diurnal field rotation) and spectral diversity.\nNumerical experiments are performed with wavefront data from the AEOS Adaptive\nOptics System sensing at 850 nm. These experiments assume a science camera\nwavelength $\\lambda$\\ of $1.1 \\, \\mu$, that the measured wavefronts are exact,\nand a Gaussian approximation of shot-noise.

Two-stage beamforming within stations can reduce SKA-low signal\nprocessing load and costs, but has not been previously explored for the\nirregular station layouts now favoured in radio astronomy arrays. This paper\nillustrates the effects of two-stage beamforming on sidelobes and effective\narea, for two representative station layouts (regular and irregular gridded\ntile on an irregular station). The performance is compared with a single-stage,\nirregular station. The inner sidelobe levels do not change significantly\nbetween layouts, but the more distant sidelobes are affected by the tile\nlayouts; regular tile creates diffuse, but regular, grating lobes. With very\nsparse arrays, the station effective area is similar between layouts. At lower\nfrequencies, the regular tile significantly reduces effective area, hence\nsensitivity. The effective area is highest for a two-stage irregular station,\nbut it requires a larger station extent than the other two layouts. Although\nthere are cost benefits for stations with two-stage beamforming, we conclude\nthat more accurate station modelling, and SKA-low configuration specifications,\nare required before design finalisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 04:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Below Curie temperature the system exhibit\nspin-glass like features such as irreversibility in the field cooled and zero\nfield cooled magnetization and frequency dependence in the peak of ac\nsusceptibility. The presence of a spin or cluster -glass like state is ruled\nout by the absence of field divergence in third harmonic of ac susceptibility\nand zero field cooled memory.

The major neutron source is\n13C(alpha, n)16O, which burns radiatively during the interpulse periods at\nabout 8 keV and produces a rather low neutron density (10^7 n/cm^3). The second\nneutron source 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg, partially activated during the convective\nthermal pulses when the energy reaches about 23 keV, gives rise to a small\nneutron exposure but a peaked neutron density (Nn(peak) > 10^11 n/cm^3). At\nmetallicities close to solar, it does not substantially change the final\ns-process abundances, but mainly affects the isotopic ratios near s-path\nbranchings sensitive to the neutron density. We examine the effect of the\npresent uncertainties of the two neutron sources operating in AGB stars, as\nwell as the competition with the 22Ne(alpha, gamma)26Mg reaction. The analysis\nis carried out on AGB the main-s process component (reproduced by an average\nbetween M(AGB; ini) = 1.5 and 3 Msun at half solar metallicity, see Arlandini\net al. 1999), using a set of updated nucleosynthesis models. Major effects are\nseen close to the branching points. In particular, 13C(alpha, n)16O mainly\naffects 86Kr and 87Rb owing to the branching at 85Kr, while small variations\nare shown for heavy isotopes by decreasing or increasing our adopted rate by a\nfactor of 2 - 3. By changing our 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg rate within a factor of 2,\na plausible reproduction of solar s-only isotopes is still obtained. We provide\na general overview of the major consequences of these variations on the s-path.\nA complete description of each branching will be presented in Bisterzo et al.,\nin preparation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 09:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-26"}

However, recent\nquantitative live cell imaging in this system has demonstrated that long-range\nmotility of motors and their endosomal cargo mainly occurs along extended\nantipolar microtubule bundles within the central part of the cell (herein\nreferred to as \"bipolar section\"). Dynein and kinesin-3 motors coordinate their\nactivity to move early endosomes (EEs) in a bidirectional fashion, with dynein\nmediating retrograde motility along the unipolar section near the cell poles,\nwhereas kinesin-3 is responsible for bidirectional motions along the antipolar\nsection. Here we extend our modelling approach to simulate bidirectional\nmotility along an antipolar microtubule bundle.

The\nbias depends on the scales used to estimate the shape, which may be used to\noptimise methods to reduce the bias. Here we develop a general approach to\nquantify the bias. Although applicable to any weak lensing survey, we focus on\nthe implications for the ESA Euclid mission.\n  Based on our study of synthetic galaxies we find that the bias is a few times\n10^-3 for a typical galaxy observed by Euclid.

This delay is due to the coupling of the higgs to the thermal\nbackground, which is formed by the Standard Model degrees of freedom created\nfrom the inflaton decay.

Formally, transforming the particles is justified by local\nfirst order expansions of the characteristic flow in phase space. In practice\nthe method amounts to using deformation matrices within the particle shape\nfunctions; these matrices are updated via local evaluations of the forward\nnumerical flow. Because it is necessary to periodically remap the particles on\na regular grid to avoid excessively deforming their shapes, the method can be\nseen as a development of Denavit's Forward Semi-Lagrangian (FSL) scheme [J.\nDenavit, J. Comp. Physics 9, 75 (1972)]. However, it has recently been\nestablished [M. Campos Pinto, \"Smooth particle methods without smoothing\",\narXiv:1112.1859 (2012)] that the underlying Linearly-Transformed Particle\nscheme converges for abstract transport problems, with no need to remap the\nparticles; deforming the particles can thus be seen as a way to significantly\nlower the remapping frequency needed in the FSL schemes, and hence the\nassociated numerical diffusion. To couple the method with electrostatic field\nsolvers, two specific charge deposition schemes are examined, and their\nperformance compared with that of the standard deposition method. Finally,\nnumerical 1d1v simulations involving benchmark test cases and halo formation in\nan initially mismatched thermal sheet beam demonstrate some advantages of our\nLTPIC scheme over the classical PIC and FSL methods. Benchmarked test cases\nalso indicate that, for numerical choices involving similar computational\neffort, the LTPIC method is capable of accuracy comparable to or exceeding that\nof state-of-the-art, high-resolution Vlasov schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 14:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 17:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-01"}

The\ndamping of the surface plasmon polariton originates from the resonant\nabsorption by the electrons (Landau damping), and the corresponding damping\nexhibits size-dependent oscillations and distinct temperature dependence\nwithout any scattering. The scattering influences the damping by introducing a\nbroadening and a shifting to the resonance. To demonstrate this, we investigate\nthe damping of the surface plasmon polariton in InAs nanowires in the presence\nof the electron-impurity, electron-phonon and electron-electron Coulomb\nscatterings. The main effect of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon\nscatterings is to introduce a broadening, whereas the electron-electron Coulomb\nscattering can not only cause a broadening, but also introduce a shifting to\nthe resonance. For InAs nanowires under investigation, the broadening due to\nthe electron-phonon scattering dominates. As a result, the scattering has a\npronounced influence on the damping of the surface plasmon polariton: The\nsize-dependent oscillations are smeared out and the temperature dependence is\nalso suppressed in the presence of the scattering. These results demonstrate\nthe the important role of the scattering on the surface plasmon polariton\ndamping in semiconductor nanowires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 15:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 03:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-11"}

Abundance ratios OH+/H2O+ of 1-2.5 are estimated in the nuclei\nof both sources. The inferred OH+ column and abundance relative to H nuclei are\n(0.5-1)x10^{16} cm-2 and \\sim2x10^{-8}, respectively.

Simple chemical models favor an ionization sequence\ndominated by H+ - O+ - OH+ - H2O+ - H3O+, and we also argue that the H+\nproduction is most likely dominated by X-ray/cosmic ray ionization. The full\nset of observations and models leads us to propose that the molecular ions\narise in a relatively low density (\\gtrsim10^4 cm-3) interclump medium, in\nwhich case the ionization rate per H nucleus (including secondary ionizations)\nis zeta>10^{-13} s-1, a lower limit that is severalx10^2 times the highest rate\nestimates for Galactic regions. In Arp 220, our lower limit for zeta is\ncompatible with estimates for the cosmic ray energy density inferred previously\nfrom the supernova rate and synchrotron radio emission, and also with the\nexpected ionization rate produced by X-rays. In NGC 4418, we argue that X-ray\nionization due to an AGN is responsible for the molecular ion production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 15:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

Such\nflows are Rayleigh stable, but must be turbulent in order to explain observed\ndata. Such a mismatch between the linear theory and observations/experiments is\nmore severe when any hydromagnetic/magnetohydrodynamic instability and then the\ncorresponding turbulence therein is ruled out. The present work explores the\neffect of stochastic noise on such hydrodynamic flows. We essentially\nconcentrate on a small section of such a flow which is nothing but a plane\nshear flow supplemented by the Coriolis effect. This also mimics a small\nsection of an astrophysical accretion disk. It is found that such\nstochastically driven flows exhibit large temporal and spatial correlations of\nperturbation velocities, and hence large energy dissipations of perturbation,\nwhich presumably generate instability. A range of angular velocity (\\Omega)\nprofiles of background flow, starting from that of constant specific angular\nmomentum (\\lambda = \\Omega r^2 ; r being the radial coordinate) to that of\nconstant circular velocity (v_\\phi = \\Omega r), is explored. However, all the\nbackground angular velocities exhibit identical growth and roughness exponents\nof perturbations, revealing a unique universality class for the stochastically\nforced hydrodynamics of rotating shear flows. This work, to the best of our\nknowledge, is the first attempt to understand origin of instability and\nturbulence in the three-dimensional Rayleigh stable rotating shear flows by\nintroducing additive noise to the underlying linearized governing equations.\nThis has important implications to resolve the turbulence problem in\nastrophysical hydrodynamic flows such as accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 07:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}
