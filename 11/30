Prior to the eruption, the\nfilament in the active region part splits into two layers: a lower layer and an\nelevated layer. The eruption occurs in several episodes. Around 14:12 UT, the\nlower layer of the active region filament breaks apart, one part ejects towards\nthe west, while the other part ejects towards the east, which leads to the\nexplosive eruption of the eastern quiescent filament. During the early rise\nphase, part of the quiescent filament sheet displays strong rolling motion\n(observed by STEREO$\\_$B) in the clockwise direction (views from east to west)\naround the filament axis. This rolling motion appears to start from the border\nof the active region, then propagates towards the east. AIA observes another\ntype of rotating motion: in some other parts of the erupting quiescent\nprominence the vertical threads turn horizontal, then turn upside down. The\nelevated active region filament does not erupt until 18:00 UT, when the\nerupting quiescent filament already reaches a very large height. We develop two\nsimplified three-dimensional models which qualitatively reproduce the observed\nrolling and rotating motions. The prominence in the models is assumed to\nconsist of a collection of discrete blobs that are tied to particular field\nlines of a helical flux rope. The observed rolling motion is reproduced by\ncontinuous twist injection into the flux rope in Model 1 from the active region\nside. Asymmetric reconnection induced by the asymmetric distribution of the\nmagnetic fields on the two sides of the filament may cause the observed rolling\nmotion. The rotating motion of the prominence threads observed by AIA is\nconsistent with the removal of the field line dips in Model 2 from the top down\nduring the eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 16:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Our study is based on spectroscopic\nobservations taken in the He I 1083.0 nm multiplet with the Tenerife Infrared\nPolarimeter attached to the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. We recorded a time\nsequence of spectra with 34 s cadence placing the slit of the spectrograph\nalmost parallel to the solar limb and crossing two feet of an intermediate\nsize, quiescent hedgerow prominence. The data show opposite Doppler shifts, +/-\n6 km/s, at the edges of the prominence feet. We argue that these shifts may be\ninterpreted as prominence plasma rotating counterclockwise around the vertical\naxis to the solar surface as viewed from above. The evolution of the prominence\nseen in EUV images taken with the Solar Dynamic Observatory provided us clues\nto interpret the results as swirling motions.

Over the past several decades, it has\nbeen recognised that this approach only determines the asymptotic stability of\nthe system, and neglects the possibility of transient perturbation growth\narising due to the nonnormality of the system. This observation motivated the\ndevelopment of a more powerful generalised stability theory (GST), which\nfocusses instead on the singular value decomposition of the linearised\npropagator of the system. While GST has had significant successes in\nunderstanding the stability of phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics, its\nmore widespread applicability has been hampered by the fact that computing the\nSVD requires both the tangent linear operator and its adjoint: deriving the\ntangent linear and adjoint models is usually a considerable challenge, and\nmanually embedding them inside an eigensolver is laborious. In this paper, we\npresent a framework for the automation of generalised stability theory, which\novercomes these difficulties. Given a compact high-level symbolic\nrepresentation of a finite element discretisation implemented in the FEniCS\nsystem, efficient C++ code is automatically generated to assemble the forward,\ntangent linear and adjoint models; these models are then used to calculate the\noptimally growing perturbations to the forward model, and their growth rates.\nBy automating the stability computations, we hope to make these powerful tools\na more routine part of computational analysis. The efficiency and generality of\nthe framework is demonstrated with applications drawn from geophysical fluid\ndynamics, phase separation and quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 17:15:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 20:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

Energetic\ncosmic neutrinos can interact inside the rock and produce leptons via a charged\ncurrent interaction. In the case of an incoming electron neutrino undergoing a\ncharged current interaction, the produced UHE electron will induce an\nunderground electromagnetic shower. At high energy (above 7.7 TeV in standard\nrock), such showers are subject to LPM (Landau, Pomeranchuk and Migdal)\nsuppression of the radiative processes cross sections (bremsstrahlung and pair\nproduction). The consequence of this suppression is that showers are elongated.\nThis effect will increase the detection probability of such events allowing\ndeeper showers to emerge with detectable energies. On the other hand, the\nphotonuclear processes which are usually neglected in electromagnetic showers\nwith respect to radiative processes, turn out to become dominant in the LPM\nregime and will reduce the shower length. In this work, we have performed a\ncomplete Monte Carlo study of an underground shower induced by UHE electrons by\ntaking into account both the LPM suppression and the photonuclear interaction.\nWe will discuss the effects of both of these processes on the shower length and\non the detectability of such events by ground arrays or fluorescence\ntelescopes.

We\ncharacterize points around which $T$ is not Lipschitz as those which can be\nreached from the origin by an optimal trajectory (of the reversed dynamics)\nwith vanishing minimized Hamiltonian.

Second, we consider a class of control-affine\n\\textit{planar} nonlinear systems satisfying a second order controllability\ncondition: we characterize the set $\\mathcal{S}$ in a neighborhood of the\norigin in a similar way and prove the $\\mathcal{H}^1$-rectifiability of\n$\\mathcal{S}$ and that $\\mathcal{H}^1(\\mathcal{S})>0$.

A finite\nDNP is built up due to a competition between hyperfine (HF) spin-flip\ntransitions and another inelastic escape mechanism from the triplets, which\nblock transport. We focus on the temperature dependence of the DNP for zero\nenergy-detuning (i.e. equal electrostatic energy of one electron in each dot\nand a singlet in the right dot). Our main result is the existence of a\ntransition temperature, below which the DNP is bistable, so a hysteretic\nleakage current versus external magnetic field B appears. This is studied in\ntwo cases: (i) Close to the crossing of the three triplet energy levels near\nB=0, where spin-blockade is lifted due to the inhomogeneity of the effective\nmagnetic field from the nuclei. (ii) At higher B-fields, where the two\nspin-polarized triplets simultaneously cross two different singlet energy\nlevels. We develop simplified models leading to different transition\ntemperatures T_TT and T_ST for the crossing of the triplet levels and the\nsinglet-triplet level crossings, respectively. We find T_TT analytically to be\ngiven solely by the HF couplings, whereas T_ST depends on various parameters\nand T_ST>T_TT. The key idea behind the existence of the transition temperatures\nat zero energy-detuning is the suppression of energy absorption compared to\nemission in the inelastic HF transitions. Finally, by comparing the rate\nequation results with Monte Carlo simulations, we discuss the importance of\nhaving both HF interaction and another escape mechanism from the triplets to\ninduce a finite DNP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 20:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2013 17:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-30"}

The lack of tidal features and multiple bulges, combine with\nthe need for an exceptionally massive (>10^11 Msun) cold gas reservoir, suggest\nthat this star formation is not the result of a merger of gas-rich galaxies.\nInstead, we propose that the high X-ray cooling rate of ~2700 Msun/yr is the\norigin of the cold gas reservoir. The combination of such a high cooling rate\nand the relatively weak radio source in the cluster core suggests that feedback\nhas been unable to halt cooling in this system, leading to this tremendous\nburst of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2013 18:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

To investigate this\nproposal, we compare the metallicity of the hosts of LGRBs, broad-lined Type Ic\n(Ic-bl) supernovae (SNe), and Type II SNe to each other and to the metallicity\ndistribution of star-forming galaxies using the SDSS to represent galaxies in\nthe local universe and the TKRS for galaxies at intermediate redshifts.\n  The differing metallicity distributions of the LGRB hosts and the star\nformation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicity\npreference of LGRBs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation between\nstar-formation and metallicity, but rather must be overwhelmingly due to the\nastrophysics of the LGRBs themselves. Three quarters of our LGRB sample are\nfound at metallicities below 12+log(O/H) < 8.6, while less than a tenth of\nlocal star-formation is at similarly low metallicities. However, our SN samples\nare statistically consistent with the metallicity distribution of the general\ngalaxy population.

In a suitable regime of parameters, the scalar\nfield can be treated as a probe field whose backreaction to both the metric and\nthe gauge field can be ignored.

We then turn on a time dependent source\nfor the order parameter which interpolates between constant values and crosses\nthe order-disorder critical point. In the critical region adiabaticity breaks\ndown, but for a small rate of change of the source $v$ there is a new small-$v$\nexpansion in fractional powers of $v$. The resulting critical dynamics is\ndominated by a zero mode of the bulk field. To lowest order in this small-$v$\nexpansion, the order parameter satisfies a time dependent Landau-Ginsburg\nequation which has $z=2$, but non-dissipative.

In this\npaper we discuss two physically meaningful regularisation procedures, one\ncorresponding to vanishing viscosity and another to weak noise limit.

In this paper, we derive the kinetic helicity density of the\nlinear MHD modes excited on top of a twisted large-scale magnetic field,\nestimate the corresponding turbulence helicity and take its effect on\nstochastic particle acceleration by the turbulence into consideration; in\nparticular, we compare this induced mean electric field with the electron and\nestimated effective ion Dreicer fields. We have discovered that this, so far\nmissing but highly important, ingredient of the turbulence at the flare site\ncan be responsible for the thermal-to-nonthermal energy partition in flares by\ncontrolling the process of particle extraction from the thermal pool and\nformation of the seed particle population to be then stochastically accelerated\nto higher energies. In addition, it is naturally consistent with such puzzling\nflare manifestations as spatial separation of electron and proton emission\nsites, electron beam formation, and enrichment of the accelerated particle\npopulation by $^3He$ and other rare ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 22:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We construct a wavelet estimator of $f$, derive minimax lower\nbounds for the $L^2$-risk when $f$ belongs to a Besov ball of mixed smoothness\nand demonstrate that the wavelet estimator is adaptive and asymptotically\nnear-optimal within a logarithmic factor, in a wide range of Besov balls. We\nprove in particular that choosing this type of mixed smoothness leads to rates\nof convergence which are free of the \"curse of dimensionality\" and, hence, are\nhigher than usual convergence rates when $r$ is large. The problem studied in\nthe paper is motivated by seismic inversion which can be reduced to solution of\nnoisy two-dimensional convolution equations that allow to draw inference on\nunderground layer structures along the chosen profiles. The common practice in\nseismology is to recover layer structures separately for each profile and then\nto combine the derived estimates into a two-dimensional function. By studying\nthe two-dimensional version of the model, we demonstrate that this strategy\nusually leads to estimators which are less accurate than the ones obtained as\ntwo-dimensional functional deconvolutions. Indeed, we show that unless the\nfunction $f$ is very smooth in the direction of the profiles, very spatially\ninhomogeneous along the other direction and the number of profiles is very\nlimited, the functional deconvolution solution has a much better precision\ncompared to a combination of $M$ solutions of separate convolution equations.

This involves recording all unphysical crossing events of a\nghost chain, and calculating the minimal uncrossing cost that would have been\nrequired to avoid such events. A depth-first tree search algorithm is applied\nto find minimal transformations to fold $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\alpha/\\beta$, and\nknotted proteins. In all cases, the extra uncrossing/non-crossing distance is a\nsmall fraction of the total distance travelled by a ghost chain. Different\nstructural classes may be distinguished by the amount of extra uncrossing\ndistance, and the effectiveness of such discrimination is compared with other\norder parameters. It was seen that non-crossing distance over chain length\nprovided the best discrimination between structural and kinetic classes. The\nscaling of non-crossing distance with chain length implies an inevitable\ncrossover to entanglement-dominated folding mechanisms for sufficiently long\nchains. We further quantify the minimal folding pathways by collecting the\nsequence of uncrossing moves, which generally involve leg, loop, and elbow-like\nuncrossing moves, and rendering the collection of these moves over the unfolded\nensemble as a multiple-transformation \"alignment\". The consensus minimal\npathway is constructed and shown schematically for representative cases of an\n$\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and knotted protein. An overlap parameter is defined between\npathways; we find that $\\alpha$ proteins have minimal overlap indicating\ndiverse folding pathways, knotted proteins are highly constrained to follow a\ndominant pathway, and $\\beta$ proteins are somewhere in between.

We have shown that, (1)\nthe TCDC is negative beyond a positive core and radius of the core shrinks as\nlattice spacing decreases, (2) as the volume decreases, the magnitude of the\ncontact term and the radius of the positive core decrease and the magnitude of\nthe negative peak increases resulting in the suppression of the topological\nsusceptibility as the volume decreases, (3) the contact term and radius of the\npositive core decrease with decreasing quark mass at a given lattice spacing\nand the negative peak increases with decreasing quark mass resulting in the\nsuppression of the topological susceptibility with decreasing quark mass, (4)\nincreasing levels of smearing suppresses the contact term and the negative peak\nkeeping the susceptibility intact and (5) both the contact term and the\nnegative peak diverge in nonintegrable fashion as lattice spacing decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 07:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-03"}

In\nthis paper, we algorithmically detect communities in social networks and image\ndata by optimizing multislice modularity. A key advantage of modularity\noptimization is that it does not require prior knowledge of the number or sizes\nof communities, and it is capable of finding network partitions that are\ncomposed of communities of different sizes. By optimizing multislice modularity\nand subsequently calculating diagnostics on the resulting network partitions,\nit is thereby possible to obtain information about network structure across\nmultiple system scales.

The first model tested is the\n`conventional' one, where it is assumed that coalescence as the formation of a\nsingle body of fluid occurs by an instant appearance of a liquid bridge\nsmoothly connecting the two drops, and the subsequent process is the evolution\nof this single body of fluid driven by capillary forces. The second model under\ninvestigation considers coalescence as a process where a section of the free\nsurface becomes trapped between the bulk phases as the drops are pressed\nagainst each other, and it is the gradual disappearance of this `internal\ninterface' that leads to the formation of a single body of fluid and the\nconventional model taking over.

Locomotion is driven by steady tangential deformation at the surface of\nthe body (so-called squirming motion).

Although they have been\ntheoretically shown to be unstable when considered separately, it is well known\nthat they form large assemblies in desert. Collisions of dunes have been\nproposed as a mechanism to redistribute sand between dunes and prevent the\nformation of heavily large dunes, resulting in a stabilizing effect in the\ncontext of a dense barchan field. Yet, no models are able to explain the\nspatial structures of dunes observed in deserts. Here, we use an agent-based\nmodel with elementary rules of sand redistribution during collisions to access\nthe full dynamics of very large barchan dune fields. Consequently, stationnary,\nout of equilibrium states emerge. Trigging the dune field density by a sand\nload/lost ratio, we show that large dune fields exhibit two assymtotic regimes:\na dilute regime, where sand dune nucleation is needed to maintain a dune field,\nand a dense regime, where dune collisions allow to stabilize the whole dune\nfield. In this dense regime, spatial structures form: the dune field is\nstructured in narrow corridors of dunes extending in the wind direction, as\nobserved in dense barchan deserts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 13:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

On a multi-antenna relay-assisted\nmulti-carrier interference channel, each user shares the frequency and spatial\nresources with all other users. When the receivers are not only interested in\ntheir own signals but also in eavesdropping other users' signals, the cross\ntalk on the frequency and spatial channels becomes information leakage. In this\npaper, we propose a novel secrecy rate enhancing relay strategy that utilizes\nboth frequency and spatial resources, termed as information leakage\nneutralization. To this end, the relay matrix is chosen such that the effective\nchannel from the transmitter to the colluding eavesdropper is equal to the\nnegative of the effective channel over the relay to the colluding eavesdropper\nand thus the information leakage to zero. Interestingly, the optimal relay\nmatrix in general is not block-diagonal which encourages users' encoding over\nthe frequency channels. We proposed two information leakage neutralization\nstrategies, namely efficient information leakage neutralization (EFFIN) and\noptimized information leakage neutralization (OPTIN). EFFIN provides a simple\nand efficient design of relay processing matrix and precoding matrices at the\ntransmitters in the scenario of limited power and computational resources.\nOPTIN, despite its higher complexity, provides a better sum secrecy rate\nperformance by optimizing the relay processing matrix and the precoding\nmatrices jointly.

The TeV emission\ndetectability is not correlated either with the spin-down power or with the\ncharacteristic age of their central pulsars, and it is an open problem what\ndetermines the detectability. To study this problem, we investigate spectral\nevolution of five young non-TeV PWNe, 3C58, G310.6-1.6, G292.0+1.8, G11.2-0.3\nand SNR B0540-69.3. We use a spectral evolution model which has been developed\nto be applied to young TeV PWNe in our previous works. TeV \\gamma-ray flux\nupper limits of non-TeV PWNe give upper or lower limits on parameters, such as\nthe age of the PWN and the fraction of the spin-down power going to the\nmagnetic energy injection (the fraction parameter). Combined with other\nindependent observational and theoretical studies, we can guess a plausible\nvalue of the parameters for each object. For 3C58, we prefer the parameters\nwith an age of 2.5 kyr old and the fraction parameter of 3.0x10^{-3}, although\nthe spectral modeling alone does not rule out a shorter age and a higher\nfraction parameter. The fraction parameter of 3.0x10^{-3} is also consistent\nfor other non-TeV PWNe and then the value is regarded as common to young PWNe\nincluding TeV PWNe. Moreover, we find that the intrinsic properties of the\ncentral pulsars are similar, 10^{48-50}erg for the initial rotational energy\nand 10^{42-44}erg for the magnetic energy (2x10^{12} - 3x10^{13}G for the\ndipole magnetic field strength at their surfaces). The TeV detectability is\ncorrelated with the total injected energy and the energy density of the\ninterstellar radiation field around PWNe. Except for G292.0+1.8, a broken\npower-law injection of the particles well reproduces the broadband emission\nfrom non-TeV PWNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 14:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 05:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This paper uses thermodynamic analysis of the\nenergy balance in the loss of dissipative electron scattering and the change in\nentropy of the conducting phase that occur in the phase transition between the\nnormal metal and the superconducting state to suggest that changes in electron\nGibbs free energy at T, from these sources are the basis for the temperature\ndependent energy gap. The critical magnetic field for a superconductor at\ntemperature, T, Hc(T) occurs when the energy of the magnetic field is equal to\nthe magnitude of the superconductor energy gap at T. When the superconductor\nenergy gap is occupied with the energy of the external magnetic field, the\nnormal metal conducting bands that became inaccessible at the superconductor -\nnormal conductor phase transition are once again available for conduction, and\nthe superconductor quenches.
