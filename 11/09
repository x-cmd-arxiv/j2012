A Pop III multiple system forms in each of the ten\nminihaloes, and the overall mass function is top-heavy compared to the\ncurrently observed initial mass function in the Milky Way. Using a sink\nparticle to represent each growing protostar, we examine the binary\ncharacteristics of the multiple systems, resolving orbits on scales as small as\n20 AU. We find a binary fraction of ~36%, with semi-major axes as large as 3000\nAU. The distribution of orbital periods is slightly peaked at < 900 yr, while\nthe distribution of mass ratios is relatively flat. Of all sink particles\nformed within the ten minihaloes, ~50% are lost to mergers with larger sinks,\nand ~50% of the remaining sinks are ejected from their star-forming disks. The\nlarge binary fraction may have important implications for Pop III evolution and\nnucleosynthesis, as well as the final fate of the first stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 16:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 May 2013 23:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

If the corresponding heavy gauge\nboson Z' mediates FCNC processes in the quark sector at tree-level, these new\nphysics contributions imply a pattern of deviations from SM expectations for\nFCNC processes depending only on Z' couplings to fermions and on its mass. This\nimplies stringent correlations between Delta F=2 and Delta F=1 observables\nwhich govern the landscape of the allowed parameter space for Z'-models.\nAnticipating the Flavour Precision Era (FPE) ahead of us we illustrate this by\nsearching for allowed oases in this landscape assuming significantly smaller\nuncertainties in CKM and hadronic parameters than presently available. To this\nend we analyze Delta F=2 observables in K^0-bar K^0 and B^0_{s,d}-bar B^0_{s,d}\nsystems and rare K and B decays including both left-handed and right-handed\nZ'-couplings to quarks in various combinations. We identify a number of\ncorrelations between various flavour observables that could test and\ndistinguish these different Z' scenarios.

Imposing the\nexisting flavour constraints, a rich pattern of deviations from the SM\nexpectations in B_{s,d} and K meson systems emerges provided M_Z'<3 TeV.

Several modern geometric tools (jet bundle\nformulation of partial differential equations (PDEs), the theory of symmetric\nhyperbolic PDE systems, covariant constructions of symplectic and Poisson\nstructures) and applies them to the construction of the phase space and the\nalgebra of observables of quasilinear classical field theories.

In this context, generalized versions of\nLCFT axioms become theorems of classical field theory, which includes a\ngeneralized Causality property.

Although\nevidence suggests that HFT contributes to the efficiency of markets, there are\nconcerns it also adds to market instability, especially during times of stress.\nCurrently, it is unclear how or why HFT produces these outcomes. In this paper,\nI use data from NASDAQ to show that HFT synchronizes prices in financial\nmarkets, making the values of related securities change contemporaneously. With\na model, I demonstrate how price synchronization leads to increased efficiency:\nprices are more accurate and transaction costs are reduced. During times of\nstress, however, localized errors quickly propagate through the financial\nsystem if safeguards are not in place. In addition, there is potential for HFT\nto enforce incorrect relationships between securities, making prices more (or\nless) correlated than economic fundamentals warrant. This research highlights\nan important role that HFT plays in markets and helps answer several puzzling\nquestions that previously seemed difficult to explain: why HFT is so prevalent,\nwhy HFT concentrates in certain securities and largely ignores others, and\nfinally, how HFT can lower transaction costs yet still make profits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 17:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-09"}

In standard cosmology, it is assumed that the universe\nis homogeneous, but this is not true at small scales (<200 Mpc). Since general\nrelativity, which is the basis of modern cosmology, is a non-linear theory, one\ncan expect some backreactions in the case of an inhomogeneous matter\ndistribution. Estimates of the magnitude of these backreactions (feedback)\nrange from insignificant to being perfectly able to explain the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe. In the end, the only way to be sure is to test\npredictions of inhomogeneous cosmological theories, such as timescape\ncosmology, against observational data. If these theories provide a valid\ndescription of the universe, one expects aside other effects, that there is a\ndependence of the Hubble parameter on the line of sight matter distribution.\nThe redshift of a galaxy, which is located at a certain distance, is expected\nto be smaller if the environment in the line of sight is mainly high density\n(clusters), rather than mainly low density environment (voids). Here we present\na test for this prediction using redshifts and fundamental plane distances of\nelliptical galaxies obtained from SDSS DR8 data. In order to get solid\nstatistics, which can handle the uncertainties in the distance estimate and the\nnatural scatter due to peculiar motions, one has to systematically study a very\nlarge number of galaxies. Therefore, the SDSS forms a perfect basis for testing\ntimescape cosmology and similar theories. The preliminary results of this\ncosmological test are shown in this contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 18:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-09"}

Emphasis is\nput on the distinction between stressors (the forces acting on the system) and\nstress (the internal reaction of the system to the stressors). This allows us\nto elaborate a classification of stress measures and of the possible responses\nto stressors. We emphasize the need for characterizing the goals of a given\nsystem, from which the process of resilience build-up can be defined.\nDistinguishing between exogenous versus endogenous sources of stress allows one\nto define the corresponding appropriate responses.

Radial velocity surveys have also revealed\nseveral Jupiter-mass planets with highly eccentric orbits. Measurements of the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect indicate some misaligned planetary systems. This\ndiversity could be induced by post-formation dynamical processes such as\nplanet-planet scattering, the Kozai effect, or secular chaos which brings\nplanets to the vicinity of their host stars. In this work, we propose a novel\nmechanism to form close-in super-Earths and Neptune-like planets through the\ntidal disruption of giant planets as a consequence of these dynamical\nprocesses. We model the core-envelope structure of giant planets with composite\npolytropes. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of close\nencounters between planets and their host stars, we find that the presence of a\ncore with a mass more than ten Earth masses can significantly increase the\nfraction of envelope which remains bound to it. After the encounter, planets\nwith cores are more likely to be retained by their host stars in contrast with\nprevious studies which suggested that coreless planets are often ejected. As a\nsubstantial fraction of their gaseous envelopes is preferentially lost while\nthe dense incompressible cores retain most of their original mass, the\nresulting metallicity of the surviving planets is increased. Our results\nsuggest that some gas giant planets can be effectively transformed into either\nsuper-Earths or Neptune-like planets after multiple close stellar passages.\nFinally, we analyze the orbits and structure of known planets and Kepler\ncandidates and find that our model is capable producing some of the\nshortest-period objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Since the carrier density is\napproximately equal to the dopant impurity density, the density dependent\ntransport shows qualitatively different behavior from that of the well-studied\n2D Si-MOSFETs where the carrier density is independent of the impurity density.\nWe find that the density dependent mobility of the Si:P system shows\nnon-monotonic behavior which is exactly opposite of the non-monotonicity\nobserved in Si-MOSFETs --- in the Si:P system the mobility first decreases with\nincreasing density and then it increases slowly with increasing density above a\ntypical density $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ (in contrast to Si MOSFETs where the\nmobility typically increases with density first and then slowly decreases at\nhigh density as surface roughness scattering dominates). In the low density\nlimit (or strong screening limit) mobility decreases inversely with increasing\ndensity, but in the high density limit (or weak screening limit) it slowly\nincreases due to the finite width effects of the 2D layer. In the intermediate\ndensity regime ($1/a < 2 k_F < q_{TF}$, where $a$, $k_F$, and $q_{TF}$ are the\nconfinement width of the $\\delta$-layer, Fermi wave vector, and Thomas-Fermi\nscreening wave vector, respectively) the density dependent mobility is\napproximately a constant at the minimum value. However, the calculated mean\nfree path increase monotonically with density. We also compare the transport\nscattering time relevant to the mobility and the single particle relaxation\ntime relevant the quantum level broadening, finding that the transport\nscattering time could be much larger than the single-particle scattering time\nunlike in Si MOSFETs where they are approximately equal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 21:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-21"}

Recent results [Lee, Lyng, & Vankova, Physica D 24\n(2012):1767--1781] suggest that, remarkably, these perturbations---interlaced\nas they are with the integrable structure of the equation---do not excite the\nacute modulational instabilities that are known to be present in the\nsemiclassical regime.

This imperfect\nsynchronization, observed in the beta frequency band, is believed to be related\nto the hypokinetic motor symptoms of the disorder. Our study explores potential\nmechanisms behind this intermittent synchrony. We study the response of a\nbursting pallidal neuron to different patterns of synaptic input from\nsubthalamic nucleus (STN) neuron. We show how external globus pallidus (GPe)\nneuron is sensitive to the phase of the input from the STN cell and can exhibit\nintermittent phase-locking with the input in the beta band. The temporal\nproperties of this intermittent phase-locking show similarities to the\nintermittent synchronization observed in experiments. We also study the\nsynchronization of GPe cells to synaptic input from the STN cell with\ndependence on the dopamine-modulated parameters. Dopamine also affects the\ncellular properties of neurons. We show how the changes in firing patterns of\nSTN neuron due to the lack of dopamine may lead to transition from a lower to a\nhigher coherent state, roughly matching the synchrony levels observed in basal\nganglia in normal and parkinsonian states. The intermittent nature of the\nneural beta band synchrony in Parkinson's disease is achieved in the model due\nto the interplay of the timing of STN input to pallidum and pallidal neuronal\ndynamics, resulting in sensitivity of pallidal output to the phase of the\narriving STN input. Thus the mechanism considered here (the change in firing\npattern of subthalamic neurons through the dopamine-induced change of membrane\nproperties) may be one of the potential mechanisms responsible for the\ngeneration of the intermittent synchronization observed in Parkinson's disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 21:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-11"}

The implications for the\nformation of exoplanetary systems, in particular the hot-Jupiter population,\nare also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 22:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A small subset of these\nevents have luminosities that evolve slowly and result in radiated energies of\naround 10^51 ergs or more. Therefore, they are likely examples of\n`pair-instability' or `pulsational pair-instability' supernovae with estimated\nprogenitor masses of 100 - 250 times that of the Sun. These events are\nexceedingly rare at low redshift, but are expected to be more common at high\nredshift because the mass distribution of the earliest stars was probably\nskewed to high values. Here we report the detection of two super-luminous\nsupernovae, at redshifts of 2.05 and 3.90, that have slowly evolving light\ncurves. We estimate the rate of events at redshifts of 2 and 4 to be\napproximately ten times higher than the rate at low redshift. The extreme\nluminosities of super-luminous supernovae extend the redshift limit for\nsupernova detection using present technology, previously 2.36, and provide a\nway of investigating the deaths of the first generation of stars to form after\nthe Big Bang.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 22:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-12"}

The discrepancy of an island is the absolute value of the number\nof red minus the number of blue points it contains. A convex partition of $S$\nis a partition of $S$ into islands with pairwise disjoint convex hulls. The\ndiscrepancy of a convex partition is the discrepancy of its island of minimum\ndiscrepancy.

The\nquasi-parallel photon-photon collision system (QPS) can provide chances to\nprobe the resonant production of these light dark fields and the induced decay\nby the coherent nature of laser fields simultaneously. By focusing\nhigh-intensity lasers with different colors in the vacuum, new colors emerge as\nthe signature of the interaction. Because four photons in the initial and final\nstates interplay via the dark field exchange, this process is analogous to\nfour-wave mixing in quantum optics, where the frequency sum and difference\namong the incident three waves generate the fourth wave with a new frequency\nvia the nonlinear property of crystals. The interaction rate of the four-wave\nmixing process has the cubic dependence on the intensity of each wave.\nTherefore, if high-intensity laser fields are given, the sensitivity to the\nweakly coupling of dark fields to photons rapidly increases over the wide mass\nrange below sub-eV. Based on the experimentally measurable photon energies and\nthe linear polarization states, we formulate the relation between the\naccessible mass-coupling domains and the high-intensity laser parameters, where\nthe effects of the finite spectrum width of pulse lasers are taken into\naccount.

In these applications, users can generate\nlocal opinions about the counterparts based on direct experiences, and these\nopinions can then be aggregated to build trust among unknown users. The\nmechanism to build new trust relationships based on existing ones is referred\nto as trust inference. State-of-the-art trust inference approaches employ the\ntransitivity property of trust by propagating trust along connected users. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel trust inference model (MaTrust) by exploring an\nequally important property of trust, i.e., the multi-aspect property. MaTrust\ndirectly characterizes multiple latent factors for each trustor and trustee\nfrom the locally-generated trust relationships. Furthermore, it can naturally\nincorporate prior knowledge as specified factors. These factors in turn serve\nas the basis to infer the unseen trustworthiness scores. Experimental\nevaluations on real data sets show that the proposed MaTrust significantly\noutperforms several benchmark trust inference models in both effectiveness and\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 04:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-12"}

Yet phasing unrelated individuals remains a challenging\nproblem. Incorporating available data from high throughput sequencing into\ntraditional statistical phasing approaches is a promising avenue to alleviate\nthese issues. We present a novel statistical method that expands on an existing\ngraphical haplotype reconstruction method (shapeIT) to incorporate phasing\ninformation from paired-end read data. The algorithm harnesses the haplotype\ngraph information estimated by shapeIT from genotypes across the population and\nrefines haplotype likelihoods for a given individual to be compatible with the\nsequencing data. Applying the method to HapMap individuals genotyped on the\nAffymetrix Axiom chip at 7,745,081 SNPs and on a trio sequenced by Complete\nGenomics, we found that the inclusion of paired end read data significantly\nimproved phasing, with reductions in switch error on the order of 4-15% against\nshapeIT across all panels. As expected, the improvements were found to be most\nsignificant at sites harboring rare variants; furthermore, we found that longer\nread sizes and higher throughput translated to greater decreases in switching\nerror, as did higher variance in the size of the insert separating the two\nreads--suggesting that multi-platform next generation sequencing may be\nexploited to yield particularly accurate haplotypes. Overall, the phasing\nimprovements afforded by this new method highlight the power of integrating\nsequencing read information and population genotype data for reconstructing\nhaplotypes in unrelated individuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 05:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-12"}

In the last decade nonlinear\nvariational approaches such as $\\ell^1$ or total variation regularizations\nbecame quite prominent regularization techniques with certain properties being\nsuperior to standard methods. In the analysis of those, singular values and\nvectors did not play any role so far, for the obvious reason that these\nproblems are nonlinear, together with the issue of defining singular values and\nsingular vectors. In this paper however we want to start a study of singular\nvalues and vectors for nonlinear variational regularization of linear inverse\nproblems, with particular focus on singular one-homogeneous regularization\nfunctionals. A major role is played by the smallest singular value, which we\ndefine as the ground state of an appropriate functional combining the\n(semi-)norm introduced by the forward operator and the regularization\nfunctional. The optimality condition for the ground state further yields a\nnatural generalization to higher singular values and vectors involving the\nsubdifferential of the regularization functional. We carry over two main\nproperties from the world of linear regularization. The first one is gaining\ninformation about scale, respectively the behavior of regularization techniques\nat different scales. This also leads to novel estimates at different scales,\ngeneralizing the estimates for the coefficients in the linear singular value\nexpansion. The second one is to provide exact solutions for variational\nregularization methods. We will show that all singular vectors can be\nreconstructed up to a scalar factor by the standard Tikhonov-type\nregularization approach even in the presence of (small) noise. Moreover, we\nwill show that they can even be reconstructed without any bias by the recently\npopularized inverse scale space method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 07:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-12"}

To\noptimize the system sum rate over the resource sharing of both D2D and cellular\nmodes, we introduce a reverse iterative combinatorial auction as the allocation\nmechanism. In the auction, all the spectrum resources are considered as a set\nof resource units, which as bidders compete to obtain business while the\npackages of the D2D pairs are auctioned off as goods in each auction round. We\nfirst formulate the valuation of each resource unit, as a basis of the proposed\nauction.

Floating particles present in\nunderwater produces Gaussian noise on the captured underwater images which\ndegrades the quality of images. The degraded underwater images are preprocessed\nby applying homomorphic, wavelet denoising and anisotropic filtering\nsequentially. The uncalibrated rectification technique is applied to\npreprocessed images to rectify the left and right images. The rectified left\nand right image lies on a common plane. To find the correspondence points in a\nleft and right images, we have applied dense stereo matching technique i.e.,\ngraph cut method.

We further investigate\ndust particle concentrations without feedback on the gas and without\nself-gravity. Strength and lifetime of zonal flows increase with the radial\nextent of the simulation box, but decrease with the azimuthal box size. Our\nsimulations support earlier results that zonal flows have a natural radial\nlength scale of 5-7 gas pressure scale heights. This is the first study that\ncombines three-dimensional MHD simulations of zonal flows and dust particles\nfeeling the gas pressure. The pressure bumps trap particles with $\\textrm{St} =\n1$ very efficiently. We show that $\\textrm{St} = 0.1$ particles (of some\ncentimeters in size if at $5\\textrm{AU}$ in an MMSN) reach a hundred-fold\nhigher density than initially. This opens the path for particles of\n$\\textrm{St} = 0.1$ and dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01 or for particles of\n$\\textrm{St} \\geq 0.5$ and dust-to-gas ratio $10^{-4}$ to still reach densities\nthat potentially trigger the streaming instability and thus gravoturbulent\nformation of planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 10:28:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 16:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 11:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The\nso-called mechanical route which corresponds to a molecular-level extension of\nthe macroscopic theory of elasticity, and is particularly popular in molecular\ndynamics simulation, also appears to be unreliable due to the inherent\nambiguity in the definition of the microscopic pressure tensor, an observation\nwhich has been known for decades but is frequently ignored.

The minimum of positive graduation in actual measurement\nprovides the possibility that an object cannot be partitioned arbitrarily,\ne.g., an interval $[0, 1]$ cannot be partitioned by arbitrarily infinite times\nto keep compatible with the minimum of positive size. For the measurement on\nsize of set, it can be assumed that this minimum is the size of ${0}$, in\nsymbols $|{0}|$ or graduation 1.

From Stern data set (12 points), we have\nobtained the bounds of the arbitrary parameters by minimizing the $\\chi^{2}$\ntest. The best-fit values of the parameters are obtained by 66%, 90% and 99%\nconfidence levels. Now to find the bounds of the parameters and to draw the\nstatistical confidence contour, we first fixed three parameters $C, n, \\alpha$\nand then fixed the three parameters $A, n, \\alpha$. In the first case we find\nthe bounds of $(A, B)$ and draw the contour between them for 4D$(n=2)$,\n5D$(n=3)$ and 6D$(n=4)$. In the second case we fixed three different values of\nA as 1, 1/3, -1/3 to find the bounds of $(B, C)$ and draw the contour between\nthem. Here the parameter $n$ determines the higher dimensions and we perform\ncomparative study between three cases : 4D $(n=2)$, 5D $(n=3)$ and 6D $(n=4)$\nrespectively. Next due to joint analysis with BAO observation, we have also\nobtained the bounds of the parameters ($A,B$) by fixing some other parameters\n$\\alpha$ and $A$ for 4D, 5D and 6D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 06:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}
