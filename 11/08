Relativistic jets emerging from AGN cores transfer energy from the\ncore to their surrounding ISM/IGM. Because jets are observed to have finite\nopening angles, one needs to quantify the role of conical versus cylindrical\njet propagation in this energy transfer. Aims. We use FR-II AGN jets parameter\nwith finite opening angles. We study the effect of the variation of the opening\nangle on the dynamics and energy transfer of the jet. We also point out how the\ncharacteristics of this external medium, such as its density profile, play a\nrole in the dynamics. Methods. This study exploits our parallel AMR code\nMPI-AMRVAC with its special relativistic hydrodynamic model, incorporating an\nequation of state with varying effective polytropic index. We studied mildly\nunder-dense jets up to opening angles of 10 degrees, at Lorentz factors of\nabout 10, inspired by observations. Instantaneous quantification of the various\nISM volumes and their energy content allows one to quantify the role of mixing\nversus shock-heated cocoon regions over the time intervals. Results. We show\nthat a wider opening angle jet results in a faster deceleration of the jet and\nleads to a wider cocoon dominated by Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstabilities. The energy transfer mainly occurs in the shocked ISM region by\nboth the frontal bow shock and cocoon-traversing shock waves, in a roughly 3 to\n1 ratio to the energy transfer of the mixing zone, for a 5 degree opening angle\njet. A rarefaction wave induces a dynamically formed layered structure of the\njet beam. Conclusions. Finite opening angle jets can efficiently transfer\nsignificant fractions (25 % up to 70 %) of their injected energy over a growing\nregion of shocked ISM matter. The role of the ISM stratification is prominent\nfor determining the overall volume that is affected by relativistic jet\ninjection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 16:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-08"}

The\nunderlying mechanism that allows for the possibility of both entanglement\nengineering and entanglement protection is the strong \"spin-orbit\" coupling\ninduced by the QW.

The radio and X-ray luminosity correlation of the form\nL_X ~L_Rad^0.62 +/-0.01 confirms the non-linear coupling between the jet and\nthe inner accretion flow powers and better defines the standard correlation\ntrack in the radio-X-ray diagram for stellar mass black holes. We further note\nepochs of deviations from the fit that significantly exceed the measurement\nuncertainties, especially during the formation and destruction of the compact\njets ...[abridged]. We incorporated our new data in a more global study of\nblack hole candidates strongly supporting a scale invariance in the\njet-accretion coupling of accreting black holes, and confirms the existence of\ntwo populations of sources in the radio/X-ray diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 16:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

These detections suggest\nthat, as more sensitive observations of PNe in the H2 {\\lambda}2.122 line are\nacquired, the detection of H2 emission is not exclusive of bipolar PNe,\nalthough objects with this morphology are still the brightest H2 emitters.\nFinally, we remark that the bright H2 emission from the equatorial ring of a\nbipolar PN does not arise from a photodissociation region shielded from the UV\nstellar radiation by the ring itself, but from dense knots and clumps embedded\nwithin the ionized material of the ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 17:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

By combining all stellar synthetic\nspectra, HITRAN-LBLRTM atmospheric transmission spectra and diffuse band\nempirical absorption profiles, we determine the 6196, 6204, and 6284 A DIB\nstrength toward the 219 target stars and discuss the sources of uncertainties.\nIn order to test the sensitivity of the DIB extraction, we intercompare the\nthree results and compare the DIB equivalent widths with the reddening derived\nfrom an independent extinction map based on OGLE photometric data. Most stellar\nspectra could be well reproduced by the composite stellar, atmospheric and\ninterstellar models. Measurement uncertainties on the EWs are smaller for the\nbroad and strong 6284 A DIB, and are of the order of 10-15%. Uncertainties on\nthe two narrow and weaker DIBs are larger, as expected, and found to be highly\nvariable from one target to the other. They strongly depend on the radial\nvelocity of the star . DIB-DIB correlations among the three bands demonstrate\nthat a meaningful signal is extracted. For the 6284 and 6204 A DIBs, the\nstar-to-star variability of the equivalent width (EW) also reflects features of\nthe OGLE extinction map...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 18:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The total luminosity, and hence power of\nthe jet is critically dependent on the position of the break in its spectrum,\nbetween optically thick (self-absorbed) and optically thin synchrotron\nemission. This break, or turnover, has been reported in just one black hole\nX-ray binary (BHXB) thus far, GX 339-4, and inferred via spectral fitting in\ntwo others, A0620-00 and Cyg X-1. Here, we collect a wealth of multiwavelength\ndata from the outbursts of BHXBs during hard X-ray states, in order to search\nfor jet breaks as yet unidentified in their spectral energy distributions. In\nparticular, we report the direct detection of the jet break in the spectrum of\nV404 Cyg during its 1989 outburst, at nu_b = (1.8 +- 0.3) x 10^14 Hz (1.7 +-\n0.2 microns).

The detection of such diffuse emission may reveal the presence of\nan accelerator of cosmic rays, and also constrain the cosmic ray diffusion\ncoefficient in its vicinity. Preliminary results in this direction have been\nobtained in the last years from studies of the gamma-ray emission from\nmolecular clouds located in the vicinity of supernova remnants, which are the\nprime candidate for cosmic ray production. Hints have been found for a\nsignificant suppression of the diffusion coefficient with respect to the\naverage one in the Galaxy. However, most of these studies rely on the\nassumption of isotropic diffusion, which may not be very well justified. Here,\nwe extend this study to the case in which cosmic rays that escape an\naccelerator diffuse preferentially along the magnetic field lines. As a first\napproximation, we further assume that particles are strongly magnetized and\nthat their transport perpendicular to the magnetic field is mainly due to the\nwandering of the field lines. The resulting spatial distribution of runaway\ncosmic rays around the accelerator is, in this case, strongly anisotropic. An\napplication of the model to the case of the supernova remnant W28 demonstrates\nhow the estimates of the diffusion coefficient from gamma-ray observations\nstrongly depend on the assumptions made on the isotropy (or anisotropy) of\ndiffusion. For higher levels of anisotropy of the diffusion, larger values of\nthe diffusion coefficient are found to provide a good fit to data.

Together, this gives us the opportunity to assess the\ncontribution of galaxies to reionisation self-consistently. The strong mass and\nredshift dependence of the escape fraction indicates that reionisation occurred\nbetween z=15 and z=10 and was mainly driven by proto-galaxies forming in\ndark-matter haloes with masses between 1e7 and 1e8 solar mass.

First, using perturbative techniques, we compare\nthe massless and massive scalar radiation emitted by a particle radially\ninfalling into a Schwarzchild black hole. We show that the late-time waveform\nof massive scalar perturbations is dominated by a universal oscillatory\ndecaying tail, which appears due to curvature effects.

In the second part, we study\nthe phenomenon of superradiance in higher dimensions and conjecture that the\nmaximum energy extracted from a rotating black hole can be understood in terms\nof the ergoregion proper volume. We then study some consequences of\nsuperradiance in the dynamics of moons orbiting around higher-dimensional\nrotating black holes. In four-dimensional spacetime, moons around black holes\ngenerate low-amplitude tides, and the energy extracted from the hole's rotation\nis always smaller than the gravitational radiation lost to infinity. We show\nthat in dimensions larger than five the energy extracted from the black hole\nthrough superradiance is larger than the energy carried out to infinity. Our\nresults lend strong support to the conjecture that tidal acceleration is the\nrule, rather than the exception, in higher dimensions. Superradiance dominates\nthe energy budget and moons \"outspiral\"; for some particular orbital frequency,\nthe energy extracted at the horizon equals the energy emitted to infinity and\n\"floating orbits\" generically occur.

These\noverdense gas substructures are generally a source of unresolved bias of X-ray\nobservations towards high density gas, but their bright luminosity peaks may be\nresolved sources within the ICM, that deep X-ray exposures may be (already)\ncapable to detect. In this paper we aim at investigating both features, using a\nset of high-resolution cosmological simulations with ENZO. First, we monitor\nhow the bias by unresolved gas clumping may yield incorrect estimates of global\ncluster parameters and affects the measurements of baryon fractions by X-ray\nobservations. We find that based on X-ray observations of narrow radial strips,\nit is difficult to recover the real baryon fraction to better than 10 - 20\npercent uncertainty.

We present an analytic characterization of the\noptimal policy, along with the associated finite-horizon time-averaged value of\nstorage. We also derive an analytical upperbound on the infinite-horizon\ntime-averaged value of storage. This bound is valid for any achievable\nrealization of prices when the support of the distribution is fixed, and\nhighlights the dependence of the value of storage on ramp constraints and\nstorage capacity. While the value of storage is a non-decreasing function of\nprice volatility, due to the finite ramp rate, the value of storage saturates\nquickly as the capacity increases, regardless of volatility. To study the\nimplications of the optimal policy, we first present computational experiments\nthat suggest that optimal utilization of storage can, in expectation, induce a\nconsiderable amount of price elasticity near the average price, but little or\nno elasticity far from it. We then present a computational framework for\nunderstanding the behavior of storage as a function of price and the amount of\nstored energy, and for characterization of the buy/sell phase transition region\nin the price-state plane. Finally, we study the impact of market-based\noperation of storage on the required reserves, and show that the reserves may\nneed to be expanded to accommodate market-based storage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 21:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-09"}

We provide detailed\ncomparisons between the extensive observations of this system and predictions\ncalculated directly from the numerical models.

Super-rotating equatorial jets form for a wide\nrange of pressures from 10^-5 to 10 bars while counter rotating jets form at\nhigher latitudes. Calculated transit spectrum agree well with the data from the\ninfrared to the UV including the strong Rayleigh scattering seen at short\nwavelength, though we slightly under-predict the observations at wavelengths\nshorter then ~0.6 microns. Our predicted emission spectrum agrees remarkably\nwell at 5.8 and 8 microns, but slightly over-predicts the emission at 3.6 and\n4.5 microns when compared to the latest analysis by Knutson et. al (2012). Our\nsimulated IRAC phasecurves agree fairly well with the amplitudes of variations,\nshape, and phases of minimum and maximum flux. However, we over-predict the\npeak amplitude at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and slightly under-predict the location\nof the phasecurve maximum and minimum. These simulations include, for the first\ntime in a multi-dimensional simulation, a strong Rayleigh scattering component\nto the absorption opacity, necessary to explain observations in the optical and\nUV. The agreement between our models and observations suggest that including\nthe effects of condensates in simulations as the dominant form of opacity will\nbe very important in future models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 22:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The goal is to recover each speech signal from the microphone\ninputs.

The\nobjective is to recover the matrix A^{-1} given random samples from X. A range\nof techniques collectively known as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have\nbeen proposed to address this problem in the signal processing and machine\nlearning literature. Many of these techniques are based on using the kurtosis\nor other cumulants to recover the components.\n  In this paper we propose a new algorithm for solving the blind signal\nseparation problem in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, when we are\ngiven samples from X=AS+\\eta, where \\eta is drawn from an unknown, not\nnecessarily spherical n-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Our approach is\nbased on a method for decorrelating a sample with additive Gaussian noise under\nthe assumption that the underlying distribution is a linear transformation of a\ndistribution with independent components. Our decorrelation routine is based on\nthe properties of cumulant tensors and can be combined with any standard\ncumulant-based method for ICA to get an algorithm that is provably robust in\nthe presence of Gaussian noise.

The competition between RKKY interaction JRKKY and the Kondo effect,\nas governed by the temperature scale TK, is known to gives rise to a rich\nmagnetic quantum phase diagram, the Doniach diagram. Our numerical calculations\nshow that in a disordered system both the Kondo temperature TK and JRKKY are\nwidely distributed. Accordingly, also their ratio, JRKKY /TK is widely\ndistributed as shown in Fig. 1 (a). However, we find a sharp cutoff of that\ndistribution, which allows us to define a critical density of magnetic\nimpurities nc below which Kondo screening wins at all sites of the system above\na critical coupling Jc, forming the Kondo phase[see Fig. 1 (b)]. As disorder is\nincreased, Jc increases and a spin coupled phase is found to grow at the\nexpense of the Kondo phase. From these distribution functions we derive the\nmagnetic susceptibility which show anomalous power law behavior. In the Kondo\nphase that power is determined by the wide distribution of the Kondo\ntemperature, while in the spin coupled phase it is governed by the distribution\nof JRKKY.

We analyzed WLF\nobservations in radio, H-alpha, white-light, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands. We\nalso studied the magnetic configuration of the flare via the nonlinear\nforce-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation and the vector magnetic field observed\nby the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO). Continuum emission enhancement clearly appeared at the 3600\nangstrom and 4250 angstrom bands, with peak contrasts of 25% and 12%,\nrespectively. The continuum emission enhancement closely coincided with the\nimpulsive increase in the hard X-ray emission and a microwave type III burst at\n03:40 UT. We find that the WLF appeared at one end of either the sheared or\ntwisted field lines or both. There was also a long-lasting phase in the H-alpha\nand soft X-ray bands after the white-light emission peak. In particular, a\nsecond, yet stronger, peak appeared at 03:56 UT in the microwave band. This\nevent shows clear evidence that the white-light emission was caused by\nenergetic particles bombarding the lower solar atmosphere. A two-step magnetic\nreconnection scenario is proposed to explain the entire process of flare\nevolution, i.e., the first-step magnetic reconnection between the field lines\nthat are highly sheared or twisted or both, and the second-step one in the\ncurrent sheet, which is stretched by the erupting flux rope. The WLF is\nsupposed to be triggered in the first-step magnetic reconnection at a\nrelatively low altitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 02:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-09"}

In particular,\nformation of sub-jovian planets remains unclear, given the short timescale for\nthe runaway accretion of massive atmospheres. However, gas needs to pass\nthrough a circum-planetary disc. If the latter has a low viscosity (as expected\nif planets form in \"dead zones\"), it might act as a bottleneck for gas\naccretion. We investigate what the minimum accretion rate is for a planet under\nthe limit assumption that the circum-planetary disc is totally inviscid, and\nthe transport of angular momentum occurs solely because of the gravitational\nperturbations from the star. To estimate the accretion rate, we present a\nsteady-state model of an inviscid circum-planetary disc, with vertical gas\ninflow and external torque from the star. Hydrodynamical simulations of a\ncircum-planetary disc were conducted in 2D, in a planetocentric frame, with the\nstar as an external perturber in order to measure the torque exerted by the\nstar on the disc. The disc shows a two-armed spiral wave caused by stellar\ntides, propagating all the way in from the outer edge of the disc towards the\nplanet. The stellar torque is small and corresponds to a doubling time for a\nJupiter mass planet of the order of 5 Myrs. Given the limit assumptions, this\nis clearly a lower bound of the real accretion rate. This result shows that gas\naccretion onto a giant planet can be regulated by circum-planetary discs. This\nsuggests that the diversity of masses of extra-solar planets may be the result\nof different viscosities in these discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 10:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The properties of the thermal\nemission are not well understood, however, and the analysis of solar flare\nobservations is often predicated on the assumption that the flare plasma is\nisothermal. The EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO) provides spectrally resolved observations of emission lines\nthat span a wide range of temperatures (e.g., Fe XV-Fe XXIV) and allow for\nthermal flare plasma to be studied in detail. In this paper we describe a\nmethod for computing the differential emission measure distribution in a flare\nusing EVE observations and apply it to several representative events. We find\nthat in all phases of the flare the differential emission measure distribution\nis broad. Comparisons of EVE spectra with calculations based on parameters\nderived from the GOES soft X-ray fluxes indicate that the isothermal\napproximation is generally a poor representation of the thermal structure of a\nflare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 15:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Inspired by observation of the\nempirical particle mass spectrum we propose that the masses of elementary\nparticles arise solely due to the self-interaction of the fields associated\nwith a particle. We thus assume that the mass is proportional to the strength\nof the interaction of the field with itself. A simple application of this idea\nto the fermions is seen to yield a mass for the neutrino in line with\nconstraints from direct experimental upper limits and correct order of\nmagnitude predictions of mass separations between neutrinos, charged leptons\nand quarks. The neutrino interacts only through the weak force, hence becomes\nlight. The electron interacts also via electromagnetism and accordingly becomes\nheavier. The quarks also have strong interactions and become heavy. The photon\nis the only fundamental particle to remain massless, as it is chargeless.\nGluons gain mass comparable to quarks, or slightly larger due to a somewhat\nlarger color charge.\n  Including particles outside the standard model proper, gravitons are not\nexactly massless, but very light due to their very weak self-interaction.\n  Some immediate and physically interesting consequences arise: i) Gluons have\nan effective range $\\sim 1$fm, physically explaining why QCD has finite reach\nii) Gravity has an effective range $\\sim 100$ Mpc coinciding with the largest\nknown structures; the cosmic voids iii) Gravitational waves undergo dispersion\neven in vacuum, and have all five polarizations (not just the two of $m=0$),\nwhich might explain why they have not yet been detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 10:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}
