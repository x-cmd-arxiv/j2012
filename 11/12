In this\npaper, a framework to non-parametrically obtain measures of entropy directly\nfrom data using operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined by\ninfinitely divisible kernels is presented. The entropy functionals, which bear\nresemblance with quantum entropies, are defined on positive definite matrices\nand satisfy similar axioms to those of Renyi's definition of entropy.\nConvergence of the proposed estimators follows from concentration results on\nthe difference between the ordered spectrum of the Gram matrices and the\nintegral operators associated to the population quantities. In this way,\ncapitalizing on both the axiomatic definition of entropy and on the\nrepresentation power of positive definite kernels, the proposed measure of\nentropy avoids the estimation of the probability distribution underlying the\ndata. Moreover, estimators of kernel-based conditional entropy and mutual\ninformation are also defined.

The weaker the coupling,\nthe smaller the back-action on the system, but also the less information\nconveyed. If the system undergoes a second measurement, the statistics of the\nfirst output can be conditioned on the value of the second one. This procedure\nis known as postselection. A postselected weak measurement of an observable can\ngive a large average output of the probe when the postselected state is nearly\northogonal to the initial state of the system. This large value is an\ninterference effect in the readout of the probe, which is initially in a\ncoherent superposition of readout states (also known as pointer states).\nUsually, the weak interaction between system and probe is considered\ninstantaneous, so that the dynamics of the probe can be neglected. However, for\na weak measurement in solid-state devices, an interaction of finite duration is\nlikely needed.\n  Here, we show how this finite duration generates a contribution of the\ndynamical phase to the readout statistics.

Such channels are information stable, hence their Shannon capacity\nexists. However, computation of the channel capacity is formidable, and only\nsome upper and lower bounds on the capacity exist. In this paper, we first show\na simple result that the parallel concatenation of two different independent\ndeletion channels with deletion probabilities $d_1$ and $d_2$, in which every\ninput bit is either transmitted over the first channel with probability of\n$\\lambda$ or over the second one with probability of $1-\\lambda$, is nothing\nbut another deletion channel with deletion probability of $d=\\lambda\nd_1+(1-\\lambda)d_2$. We then provide an upper bound on the concatenated\ndeletion channel capacity $C(d)$ in terms of the weighted average of $C(d_1)$,\n$C(d_2)$ and the parameters of the three channels. An interesting consequence\nof this bound is that $C(\\lambda d_1+(1-\\lambda))\\leq \\lambda C(d_1)$ which\nenables us to provide an improved upper bound on the capacity of the i.i.d.\ndeletion channels, i.e., $C(d)\\leq 0.4143(1-d)$ for $d\\geq 0.65$. This\ngeneralizes the asymptotic result by Dalai as it remains valid for all $d\\geq\n0.65$.

Although the secondary star has not been identified in spectra,\nthe mass of the primary star can be constrained using other eclipsing binaries\nin the cluster. The combination of total eclipses and a mass constraint for the\nprimary star allows us to determine a reliable mass for the secondary star and\nradii for both stars, and to constrain the cluster age. Unlike well-measured\nstars of similar mass in field binaries, the low-mass secondary is not\nsignificantly inflated in radius compared to model predictions. The primary\nstar characteristics, in combination with cluster photometry and masses from\nother cluster binaries, indicates a best age of 2.62+/-0.25 Gyr, although\nstellar model physics may introduce systematic uncertainties at the ~10% level.\nWe find preliminary evidence that the asteroseismic predictions for red giant\nmasses in this cluster are systematically too high by as much as 8%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 07:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Conformal mappings\nhave been widely used to obtain a diffeomorphism between shapes that minimizes\nangular distortion. Conformal registrations are beneficial since it preserves\nthe local geometry well. However, when landmark constraints are enforced,\nconformal mappings generally do not exist. This motivates us to look for a\nunique landmark matching quasi-conformal registration, which minimizes the\nconformality distortion. Under suitable condition on the landmark constraints,\na unique diffeomporphism, called the Teichm\\\"uller extremal mapping between two\nsurfaces can be obtained, which minimizes the maximal conformality distortion.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, called the\nQuasi-conformal (QC) iterations, to compute the Teichm\\\"uller mapping. The\nbasic idea is to represent the set of diffeomorphisms using Beltrami\ncoefficients (BCs), and look for an optimal BC associated to the desired\nTeichm\\\"uller mapping. The associated diffeomorphism can be efficiently\nreconstructed from the optimal BC using the Linear Beltrami Solver(LBS). Using\nBCs to represent diffeomorphisms guarantees the diffeomorphic property of the\nregistration. Using our proposed method, the Teichm\\\"uller mapping can be\naccurately and efficiently computed within 10 seconds. The obtained\nregistration is guaranteed to be bijective. The proposed algorithm can also be\nextended to compute Teichm\\\"uller mapping with soft landmark constraints. We\napplied the proposed algorithm to real applications, such as brain landmark\nmatching registration, constrained texture mapping and human face registration.\nExperimental results shows that our method is both effective and efficient in\ncomputing a non-overlap landmark matching registration with least amount of\nconformality distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 11:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

It is a combined effect of the softest point inherent in an\nequation of state (EoS) with a phase transition and a change in the\nnonequilibrium dynamics from hadronic to partonic transport. Thus, this\nirregularity is a signal from a hot and dense stage of the nuclear collision.\nIn order to illustrate this proposition, calculations within the three-fluid\nmodel were performed with three different EoS's: a purely hadronic EoS, an EoS\nwith a first-order phase transition and that with a smooth crossover\ntransition. It is found that predictions within the first-order-transition\nscenario indeed reveal an a strong irregularity in the incident energy\ndependence of the form of the net-proton rapidity distributions in central\ncollisions. This behavior is in contrast to that for the hadronic scenario,\nwhere the distribution form gradually evolve, displaying no irregularity. The\ncase of the crossover EoS is intermediate. Only a weak irregularity takes\nplace. Experimental data also exhibit a trend of similar irregularity, which is\nhowever based on still preliminary data at energies of 20A GeV and 30A GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 11:46:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 08:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 06:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We investigate the role played by\nambient density fluctuations on the beam-plasma relaxation, focusing on the\neffect of acceleration of beam electrons. The scattering of Langmuir waves off\nturbulent density fluctuations is modeled as a wavenumber diffusion process\nwhich is implemented in numerical simulations of the one-dimensional\nquasilinear kinetic equations describing the beam relaxation. The results show\nthat a substantial number of beam electrons are accelerated when the diffusive\ntime scale in wavenumber space \\tau_D is of the order of the quasilinear time\nscale \\tau_ql, while when \\tau_D << \\tau_ql, the beam relaxation is suppressed.\nPlasma inhomogeneities are therefore an important means of energy\nredistribution for waves and hence electrons, and so must be taken into account\nwhen interpreting, for example, hard X-ray or Type III emission from\nflare-accelerated electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 12:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

To construct and interpret the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of BL Lacertae objects, simultaneous broad-band observations\nare mandatory. Aims. We present the results of a dedicated multi-wavelength\nstudy of the high-frequency peaked BL Lacertae (HBL) object and known TeV\nemitter 1ES 2344+514 by means of a pre-organised campaign. Methods. The\nobservations were conducted during simultaneous visibility windows of MAGIC and\nAGILE in late 2008. The measurements were complemented by Mets\\\"ahovi,\nRATAN-600, KVA+Tuorla, Swift and VLBA pointings. Additional coverage was\nprovided by the ongoing long-term F-GAMMA and MOJAVE programs, the OVRO 40-m\nand CrAO telescopes as well as the Fermi satellite. The obtained SEDs are\nmodelled using a one-zone as well as a self-consistent two-zone synchrotron\nself-Compton model. Results. 1ES 2344+514 was found at very low flux states in\nboth X-rays and very high energy gamma rays. Variability was detected in the\nlow frequency radio and X-ray bands only, where for the latter a small flare\nwas observed. The X-ray flare was possibly caused by shock acceleration\ncharacterised by similar cooling and acceleration time scales. MOJAVE VLBA\nmonitoring reveals a static jet whose components are stable over time scales of\neleven years, contrary to previous findings. There appears to be no significant\ncorrelation between the 15 GHz and R-band monitoring light curves. The\nobservations presented here constitute the first multi-wavelength campaign on\n1ES 2344+514 from radio to VHE energies and one of the few simultaneous SEDs\nduring low activity states. The quasi-simultaneous Fermi-LAT data poses some\nchallenges for SED modelling, but in general the SEDs are described well by\nboth applied models. The resulting parameters are typical for TeV emitting\nHBLs. Consequently it remains unclear whether a so-called quiescent state was\nfound in this campaign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 13:39:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 09:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

The amount of excess that is detected appears to be independent of\nall directly observed optical continuum, radio or submm properties (fluxes or\npolarizations). The only trend that occurs in this sparse data is: the stronger\nthe BEL, the larger the fraction of flux that resides in the redwing.

The reactions reported\npreviously were capable of the calculation of three distinct Voronoi diagrams\nof the plane. As diffusion coupled with a chemical reaction is responsible for\nthe calculation then this is achieved in parallel. Thus an increase in the\ncomplexity of the data input does not utilise additional computational\nresource. Additional benefits of these chemical reactions is that a permanent\nrecord of the Voronoi diagram calculation (in the form of precipitate free\nbisectors) is achieved, so there is no requirement for further processing to\nextract the calculation results.

The first and simplest model, M1, has a\nsingle free parameter, and assumes that the relative axes of a core are drawn\nrandomly from a log-normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation\n\\sigma o. The second model, M2a, has two free parameters, and assumes that the\nlog-normal distribution (with standard deviation \\sigma o) has a finite mean,\n\\mu o, defined so that \\mu o<0 means elongated (prolate) cores are favoured,\nwhereas \\mu o>0 means flattened (oblate) cores are favoured.

Water masers present a symmetric spatial distribution with respect to\nthe HMC center, where two nearby (0.2\" apart), compact, VLA sources (labeled\n\"A\" and \"B\") are previously detected. The spatial distribution of a first group\nof water masers, named \"J1\", is well fit with an elliptical profile, and the\nmaser proper motions mainly diverge from the ellipse center, with average speed\nof 36 km s-1. These findings strongly suggest that the \"J1\" water maser group\ntraces the heads of a young (dynamical time of 1.3 10^3 yr), powerful (momentum\nrate of ~0.2 M_sun yr-1 km s-1), collimated (semi-opening angle ~10 deg) jet\nemerging from a MYSO located close (within 0.15\") to the VLA source \"B\".

The elongated distribution of the \"J2\" group and the\ndirection of motion, approximately parallel to the direction of elongation, of\nmost \"J2\" water masers suggests the presence of another collimated outflow,\nemitted from a MYSO near the VLA source \"A\".

The goal is to find the most profitable subset\nof tasks whose total demand does not violate the edge capacities. This problem\nnaturally arises in many settings such as bandwidth allocation, resource\nconstrained scheduling, and interval packing.\n  A natural task classification defines the size of a task i to be the ratio\ndelta between the demand of i and the minimum capacity of any edge used by i.\nIf all tasks have sufficiently small delta, the problem is already well\nunderstood and there is a 1+eps approximation. For the complementary\nsetting---instances whose tasks all have large delta---much remains unknown,\nand the best known polynomial-time procedure gives only (for any constant\ndelta>0) an approximation ratio of 6+eps.\n  In this paper we present a polynomial time 1+eps approximation for the latter\nsetting. Key to this result is a complex geometrically inspired dynamic\nprogram. Here each task is represented as a segment underneath the capacity\ncurve, and we identify a proper maze-like structure so that each passage of the\nmaze is crossed by only O(1) tasks in the computed solution. In combination\nwith the known PTAS for delta-small tasks, our result implies a 2+eps\napproximation for UFP, improving on the previous best 7+eps approximation\n[Bonsma et al., FOCS 2011].
