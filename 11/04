In these systems, the\ndominant tidal effects involve the excitation of gravity waves and their\ndissipation in the outer envelope of the star. We calculate the amplitude of\ntidally excited gravity waves in low-mass (0.3M_\\odot) helium-core (He) WDs as\na function of the tidal forcing frequency \\omega. Like carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs\nstudied in our previous paper, we find that the dimensionless tidal torque\nF(\\omega) (inversely proportional to the effective tidal quality factor) has an\nerratic dependence on \\omega.

We examine where the\ntidally excited gravity waves experience non-linear breaking or resonant\nabsorption at a critical layer, allowing us to estimate the location and\nmagnitude of tidal heating in the WD envelope.

This has implications for many aspects of\nstar and planet formation, including the growth of dust and high-temperature\nprocessing of materials. A defining result is that the early evolution of a\ndisk is crucially affected by the continuing mass loading from the core\nenvelope, and is driven into recurrent phases of gravitational instability.\nNonlinear spiral arms formed during these episodes fragment to form gaseous\nclumps in the disk. These clumps generally migrate inward due to gravitational\ntorques arising from their interaction with a trailing spiral arm.\nOccasionally, a clump can open up a gap in the disk and settle into a stable\norbit, revealing a direct pathway to the formation of companion stars, brown\ndwarfs, or giant planets. At other times, when multiple clumps are present, a\nlow mass clump may even be ejected from the system, providing a pathway to the\nformation of free-floating brown dwarfs and giant planets in addition to low\nmass stars. Finally, it has been suggested that the inward migration of gaseous\nclumps can provide the proper conditions for the transport of high-temperature\nprocessed solids from the outer disk to the inner disk, and even possibly\naccelerate the formation of terrestrial planets in the inner disk. All of these\nfeatures arising from clump formation and migration can be tied together\nconceptually in a Migrating Embryo model for disk evolution that can complement\nthe well-known Core Accretion model for planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2012 17:32:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 05:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Indeed, molecule-to-molecule variations in the dynamics of enzymes and\nribozymes under folding conditions have recently been identified in single\nmolecule experiments. However, systematic quantification and the structural\norigin of the observed complex behavior remain elusive. Even for a relatively\nsimple case of isomerization dynamics in Holliday Junctions (HJs), molecular\nheterogeneities persist over a long observation time (Tobs ~ 40 sec). Here,\nusing concepts in glass physics and complementary clustering analysis, we\nprovide a quantitative method to analyze the smFRET data probing the\nisomerization in HJ dynamics. We show that ergodicity of HJ dynamics is\neffectively broken; as a result, the conformational space of HJs is partitioned\ninto a folding network of kinetically disconnected clusters. While\nisomerization dynamics in each cluster occurs rapidly as if the associated\nconformational space is fully sampled, distinct patterns of time series\nbelonging to different clusters do not interconvert on Tobs. Theory suggests\nthat persistent heterogeneity of HJ dynamics is a consequence of internal\nmultiloops with varying sizes and flexibilities frozen by Mg2+ ions. An\nannealing experiment using Mg2+ pulse that changes the Mg2+ cocentration from\nhigh to low to high values lends support to this idea by explicitly showing\nthat interconversions can be driven among trajectories with different patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 05:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

The Abelian decomposition is defined in terms of a colour field\n$n$; the principle novelty of our study is that we have used a unique\ndefinition of this field in terms of the eigenvectors of the Wilson Loop. This\nallows us to investigate the relationship between the gauge invariant monopoles\nand confinement both analytically and numerically, as well as retaining the\nmaximal possible symmetry within the colour field so that it is able to see all\nthe monopoles in an SU($N_C$) calculation.\n  We describe how the Abelian decomposition is related to the Wilson Loop, so\nthat the string tension may be calculated from the field strength related to\nthe decomposed (or restricted) Abelian field.

In particular, recent observations with the Herschel Space\nObservatory emphasize the importance of large-scale filaments (few parsecs) and\nstar formation. The small-scale flattened envelopes around Class 0 sources are\nreminiscent of the large-scale filaments. We propose an observationally derived\nscenario for filamentary star formation that describes the evolution of\nfilaments as part of the process for formation of cores and circumstellar\nenvelopes. If such a scenario is correct, small-scale filamentary structures\n(0.1 pc in length) with higher densities embedded in starless cores should\nexist, although to date almost all the interferometers have failed to observe\nsuch structures.

The heliometric method is one of the\nmost successful techniques to measure small variations of angles. Its principle\nhas been used for the latest space borne astrometric missions, aiming to\nmilli-arcsecond precision. The success of this method relies in the fact that\nit minimizes the dependence of angular measurements to the thermal and\nmechanical stability of the instrument. However in the classic heliometer the\nobjective is split into two halves to which is applied a linear displacement\nalong the cut, thus still leaving room for a residual dependence with the\nfocus, due to non-concentricity of the beams of the two images. The focus\nvariation, as well as the effects brought by the large temperature variations\nduring solar observations, was tackled in the Solar Heliometer by having all\noptical elements and their niches made on CCZ, and the telescope tube on carbon\nfiber, both materials of negligible thermal coefficient. Additionally, the\nmeasures are made perpendicular to the separation direction and the plate scale\ncan be known at every time from the solar motion itself. We present the results\nfrom the first year of measurements, in special exploring the upheaval of solar\nactivity on late 2011.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 12:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

No other stellar arc is so perfect a segment of a\ncircle, moreover, there is another similar arc nearby. Many hypotheses were\nadvanced to explain these arcs, and all but one of these were disproved. It was\nproposed in 2004 that origin of these arcs was due to the bow shock from the\njet, which is intermittently fired by the Milky Way nucleus and during the last\nepisode of its activity the jet was pointed to the LMC. Quite recently evidence\nfor such a jet has really appeared. We suppose it was once energetic enough to\ntrigger star formation in the LMC, and if the jet opening angle was about\n2{\\deg}, it could push out HI gas from the region of about 2 kpc in size,\nforming a cavity LMC4, but also squeezed two dense clouds, which occurred in\nthe same area, causing the formation of stars along their surfaces facing the\ncore of the MW. In result, spherical segments of the stellar shells might\narise, visible now as the arcs of Quadrant and Sextant, the apices of which\npoint to the center of the MW. This orientation of both arcs can be the key to\nunlocking their origin. Here we give data which confirm the above hypothesis,\namongst which are radial velocities of stars inside and outside the larger one\nof the LMC arcs. The probability is low that a jet from an AGN points to a\nnearby galaxy and triggers star formation there, but a few other examples are\nnow known or suspected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 13:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Theoretical analyses relate this breakdown with the\npresence of heterogeneous dynamics, and by extension, with the fragility of\nglass formers. We perform an investigation of the breakdown of the SE relation\nin 2, 3 and 4 dimensions, in order to understand these interrelations. Results\nfrom simulations of model glass formers show that the degree of the breakdown\nof the SE relation decreases with increasing spatial dimensionality. The\nbreakdown itself can be rationalized via the difference between the activation\nfree energies for diffusivity and viscosity (or relaxation times) in the\nAdam-Gibbs relation in three and four dimensions. The behavior in two\ndimensions also can be understood in terms of a generalized Adam-Gibbs relation\nthat is observed in previous work. We calculate various measures of\nheterogeneity of dynamics and find that the degree of the SE breakdown and\nmeasures of heterogeneity of dynamics are generally well correlated but with\nsome exceptions. The two dimensional systems we study show deviations from the\npattern of behavior of the three and four dimensional systems both at high and\nlow temperatures.

In conventional broad-beam delivery, fine range adjustment is\nachieved by insertion of range shifting and compensating materials. In\ndosimetry, solid phantoms are often used for convenience. These materials\nshould ideally be equivalent to water. In this study, we evaluated dosimetric\nwater equivalence of four common plastics, HDPE, PMMA, PET, and POM.\n  Methods: Using the Bethe formula for energy loss, the Gottschalk formula for\nmultiple scattering, and the Sihver formula for nuclear interactions, we\ncalculated the effective densities of the plastics for these interactions. We\nexperimentally measured variation of the Bragg peak of carbon-ion beams by\ninsertion of HDPE, PMMA, and POM, which were compared with analytical model\ncalculations.\n  Results: The theoretical calculation resulted in slightly reduced multiple\nscattering and severely increased nuclear interactions for HDPE, compared to\nwater and the other plastics. The increase in attenuation of carbon ions for\n20-cm range shift was experimentally measured to be 8.9\\% for HDPE, 2.5\\% for\nPMMA, and 0.0\\% for POM while PET was theoretically estimated to be in between\nPMMA and POM. The agreement between the measurements and the calculations was\nabout 1\\% or better.\n  Conclusions: For carbon-ion beams, POM was dosimetrically indistinguishable\nfrom water and the best of the plastics examined in this study. The poorest was\nHDPE, which would reduce the Bragg peak by 0.45\\% per 1-cm range shift,\nalthough with marginal superiority for reduced multiple scattering. Between the\ntwo clear plastics, PET would be superior to PMMA in dosimetric water\nequivalence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 15:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 10:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 06:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

The data were used to generate dielectronic recombination data\nfor C+ which include transition lines, oscillator strengths, radiative\ntransition probabilities, emissivities and dielectronic recombination\ncoefficients. The data were cast in a line list containing 6187\noptically-allowed transitions which include many C II lines observed in\nastronomical spectra. This line list was used to analyze the spectra from a\nnumber of astronomical objects, mainly planetary nebulae, and identify their\nelectron temperature. The electron temperature investigation was also extended\nto include free electron energy analysis to investigate the long-standing\nproblem of discrepancy between the results of recombination and forbidden lines\nanalysis and its possible connection to the electron distribution.\n  In the second section we present the results of our molecular investigation;\nthe generation of a comprehensive, calculated line list of frequencies and\ntransition probabilities for H2D+.

The nuclei\nare in vacuum with no connection to any external source (electric or magnetic\nfield, illumination, surrounding matter, traps, etc.) which may accelerate\nthem. The energy of two nuclei is conserved and remains small during the motion\nthrough the Coulomb barrier. The penetration through this barrier, which is the\nmain obstacle for low-energy fusion, strongly depends on a form of the incident\nflux on the Coulomb center at large distances from it. In contrast to the usual\nscattering, the incident wave is not a single plane wave but the certain\nsuperposition of plane waves of the same energy and various directions, for\nexample, a convergent conical wave. The wave function close to the Coulomb\ncenter is determined by a cusp caustic which is probed by de Broglie waves. The\nparticle flux gets away from the cusp and moves to the Coulomb center providing\na not small probability of fusion (cusp driven tunneling). Getting away from a\ncaustic cusp also occurs in optics and acoustics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2012 23:51:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 13:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 00:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-05"}
