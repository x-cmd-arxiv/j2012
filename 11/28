In discs where the viscous heating is balanced by\nradiative transport, the migration can be directed outwards, a process which\nextends the lifetime of growing planetary embryos. We investigate the influence\nof opacity and stellar irradiation on the disc thermodynamics. Utilizing the\nresulting disc structure, we determine the regions of outward migration. We\nperform two-dimensional numerical simulations of equilibrium discs with viscous\nheating, radiative cooling and stellar irradiation. We use the hydrodynamical\ncode NIRVANA that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation, as\nwell as a two temperature solver that includes radiation transport in the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation. The migration is studied by using torque\nformulae. In the constant opacity case, we reproduce the analytical results of\na black-body disc: the stellar irradiation dominates in the outer regions --\nleading to flaring -- while the viscous heating dominates close to the star. We\nfind that the inner edge of the disc should not be significantly puffed-up by\nthe stellar irradiation. If the opacity depends on the local density and\ntemperature, the structure of the disc is different, and several bumps in the\naspect ratio H/r appear, due to transitions between different opacity regimes.\nThe bumps in the disc can shield the outer disc from stellar irradiation.\nStellar irradiation is an important factor for determining the disc structure\nand has dramatic consequences for the migration of embedded planets. Compared\nto discs with only viscous heating, a stellar irradiated disc features a much\nsmaller region of outward migration for a range of planetary masses. This\nsuggests that the region where the formation of giant planet cores takes place\nis smaller, which in turn might lead to a shorter growth phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 16:19:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2012 17:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

The sign can be measured by a\ndecomposition of proton and neutron transition radii with a combination of\ninelastic electron and hadron scattering [C. Walz et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106,\n062501 (2011)]. For the case of 92Zr, a difference could be experimentally\nestablished for the neutron components, while about equal proton transition\nradii were indicated by the data. Method: Differential cross sections for the\nexcitation of one-phonon 2+ and 3- states in 92Zr have been measured with the\n(e,e') reaction at the S-DALINAC in a momentum transfer range q = 0.3-0.6\nfm^(-1). Results: Transition strengths B(E2;2+_1 -> 0+_1) = 6.18(23), B(E2;\n2+_2 -> 0+_1) = 3.31(10) and B(E3; 3-_1 -> 0+_1) = 18.4(11) Weisskopf units are\ndetermined from a comparison of the experimental cross sections to\nquasiparticle-phonon model (QPM) calculations. It is shown that a\nmodel-independent plane wave Born approximation (PWBA) analysis can fix the\nratio of B(E2) transition strengths to the 2+_(1,2) states with a precision of\nabout 1%. The method furthermore allows to extract their proton transition\nradii difference. With the present data -0.12(51) fm is obtained. Conclusions:\nElectron scattering at low momentum transfers can provide information on\ntransition radii differences of one-phonon 2+ states even in heavy nuclei.\nProton transition radii for the 2+_(1,2) states in 92Zr are found to be\nidentical within uncertainties.

The consideration of entanglement between\nthe quantum states of two or more universes in a multiverse scenario provides\nus with a completely new paradigm that opens the door to novel approaches for\ntraditionally unsolved problems in cosmology. More precisely, the problems of\nthe cosmological constant, the arrow of time and the choice of boundary\nconditions, among others. It also encourages us to adopt new points of view\nabout major philosophical ideas. In this chapter, we shall present the main\nfeatures that may characterize inter-universal entanglement and it will be\naddressed the customary problems of cosmology from the new perspective that the\nquantum multiverse scenario supplies us with.\n  In summary, the appropriate boundary condition that has to be imposed on the\nquantum state of the whole multiverse allows us to interpret it as made up of\nentangled pairs of universes. Then, a quantum thermodynamical description of\nsingle universes can be given and it can be shown that it may induce observable\neffects in the energy properties of the Universe. The effects that the boundary\ncondition of the multiverse has on the vacuum energy and the arrow of time of\nsingle universes are also studied. As a consequence of inter-universal\nentanglement, the former might be discriminated from observational data and the\nlatter would favor the growth of cosmic structures that increase the amount of\nlocal entropy mainly in the very early phase of the universe. All these\ncharacteristics of inter-universal entanglement would eventually impel us to\ndevelop the concept of the physical multiverse, one for which the theory could\nbe not only fallible but also indirectly observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 17:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}

This model\nextends and complements many of the existing mathematical models for bone\nremodeling but can be used to explore aspects of the process of bone remodeling\nthat were previously beyond the scope of prior modeling work. Through numerical\nsimulations we demonstrate that our model can be used to theoretically explore\nmany of the most recent experimental results for bone remodeling, and can be\nutilized to assess the effects of novel bone-targeting agents on the bone\nremodeling process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 19:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 22:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 18:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

The reddening of NGC 7788 is much larger than previously estimated.\nThe luminosity functions (LFs) of King 12 and NGC 7788 show breaks that are\nattributed to the onset of pre-main sequence (PMS) objects, and comparisons\nwith models of PMS evolution yield ages that are consistent with those measured\nfrom stars near the MSTO. In contrast, the r' LF of main sequence stars in NGC\n7790 is matched to r' = 20 by a model that is based on the solar neighborhood\nmass function. The structural properties of all three clusters are investigated\nby examining the two-point angular correlation function of blue main sequence\nstars. King 12 and NGC 7788 are each surrounded by a stellar halo that extends\nout to 5 arcmin (~ 3.4 parsecs) radius. It is suggested that these halos form\nin response to large-scale mass ejection early in the evolution of the\nclusters, as predicted by models. In contrast, blue main sequence stars in NGC\n7790 are traced out to a radius of ~ 7.5 arcmin, with no evidence of a halo.

First we combine the interpretation of A as a connection on a principal\nU(1)-bundle with the perspective of general covariance to deduce a physical\ngauge equivalence relation, which is intimately related to the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect. By Peierls' method we subsequently find a Poisson bracket on the space\nof local, affine observables of the theory. This Poisson bracket is in general\ndegenerate, leading to a quantum theory with non-local behaviour. We show that\nthis non-local behaviour can be fully explained in terms of Gauss' law. Thus\nour analysis establishes a relationship, via the Poisson bracket, between the\nAharonov-Bohm effect and Gauss' law (a relationship which seems to have gone\nunnoticed so far).

Following recent theoretical models of wind mass loss and core\ncollapse supernovae, we assume that the mass of the stellar remnants depends on\nthe metallicity of the progenitor stars.

Much of our focus\nis on the simple example of a free massive Dirac fermion, the so-called Chern\ninsulator, especially in 2+1 dimensions. In such cases, when parity and\ntime-reversal symmetry are broken, it is necessary to consider the\ngravitational sources to include a frame and an independent spin connection\nwith torsion. In 2+1 dimensions, the simplest parity-odd response is the Hall\nviscosity. We compute the Hall viscosity of the Chern insulator using a careful\nregularization scheme, and find that although the Hall viscosity is generally\ndivergent, the difference in Hall viscosities of distinct topological phases is\nwell-defined and determined by the mass gap. Furthermore, on a 1+1-dimensional\nedge between topological phases, the jump in the Hall viscosity across the\ninterface is encoded, through familiar anomaly inflow mechanisms, in the\nstructure of anomalies. In particular, we find new torsional contributions to\nthe covariant diffeomorphism anomaly in 1+1 dimensions.

But their impact on atomic-scale electronic structure, while\nin theory quite complex, is unknown experimentally. What is known is that a\nstrong transport anisotropy with its resistivity maximum along the crystal\nb-axis, develops with increasing concentration of dopant atoms; this\n`nematicity' vanishes when the `parent' phase disappears near the maximum\nsuperconducting Tc. The interplay between the electronic structure surrounding\neach dopant atom, quasiparticle scattering therefrom, and the transport\nnematicity has therefore become a pivotal focus of research into these\nmaterials. Here, by directly visualizing the atomic-scale electronic structure,\nwe show that substituting Co for Fe atoms in underdoped Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2\ngenerates a dense population of identical anisotropic impurity states. Each is\n~8 Fe-Fe unit cells in length, and all are distributed randomly but aligned\nwith the antiferromagnetic a-axis. By imaging their surrounding interference\npatterns, we further demonstrate that these impurity states scatter\nquasiparticles in a highly anisotropic manner, with the maximum scattering rate\nconcentrated along the b-axis. These data provide direct support for the recent\nproposals that it is primarily anisotropic scattering by dopant-induced\nimpurity states that generates the transport nematicity; they also yield simple\nexplanations for the enhancement of the nematicity proportional to the dopant\ndensity and for the occurrence of the highest resistivity along the b-axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 21:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-24"}

The demise of this technology at the end of the 1960's, and the\nreasons for the rise of parabolic dishes is also considered. The parallels with\nthe Antikythera mechanism (see these proceedings) as a lost technology are\nbriefly presented. Aperture Arrays re-entered the world of radio astronomy as\nthe idea to build a huge radio telescope with a collecting area of one square\nkilometre (the Square Kilometre Array, SKA) arose. Huge ICT technology advances\nhad transformed Aperture Arrays in terms of their capability, flexibility and\nreliability. In the mid-1990s, ASTRON started to develop and experiment with\nthe first high frequency aperture array tiles for radio astronomy - AAD, OSMA,\nTHEA & EMBRACE. In the slipstream of these efforts, Phased Array Feeds (PAFs)\nfor radio astronomy were invented and LOFAR itself emerged as a next generation\ntelescope and a major pathfinder for the SKA. Meanwhile, the same advantages\nthat aperture arrays offered to radio astronomy had already made dishes\nobsolete in many different civilian and military applications. The first\ncommissioning results from LOFAR and other Aperture Arrays (MWA, LWA and PAPER)\ncurrently demonstrate that this kind of technology can transform radio\nastronomy over 2 decades of the radio spectrum, and at frequencies up to at\nleast 1.5 GHz. This \"reinvention of radio astronomy\" has important implications\nfor the design and form of the full SKA. Building a SKA that is simply the \"VLA\non steroids\" is simply not good enough.

Unlike hydrogen-burning stars, they\ncool and become less luminous with time, and hence their IHZ moves in with\ntime. The inner edge of the IHZ is defined as the orbital radius at which a\nplanet may enter a moist or runaway greenhouse, phenomena that can remove a\nplanet's surface water forever. Thus, as the IHZ moves in, planets that enter\nit may no longer have any water, and are still uninhabitable. Additionally, the\nclose proximity of the IHZ to the primary leads to concern that tidal heating\nmay also be strong enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse, even for orbital\neccentricities as small as 10^-6. Water loss occurs due to photolyzation by UV\nphotons in the planetary stratosphere, followed by hydrogen escape. Young white\ndwarfs emit a large amount of these photons as their surface temperatures are\nover 10^4 K. The situation is less clear for brown dwarfs, as observational\ndata do not constrain their early activity and UV emission very well.\nNonetheless, both types of planets are at risk of never achieving habitable\nconditions, but planets orbiting white dwarfs may be less likely to sustain\nlife than those orbiting brown dwarfs. We consider the future habitability of\nthe planet candidates KOI 55.01 and 55.02 in these terms and find they are\nunlikely to become habitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 22:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Even in the simplest situation for sampling,\nwhich is sampling with replacement, the innocent phrase \"the distribution of\nthe color of a matching pair\" is ambiguous. One interpretation is that we\ncondition on the event of getting a match between two random socks; this\ncorresponds to sampling two at a time, over and over without memory, until a\nmatching pair is found. A second interpretation is to sample sequentially, one\nat a time, with memory, until the same color has been seen twice.\n  We study the difference between these two methods. The input is a discrete\nprobability distribution on colors, describing what happens when one sock is\nsampled. There are two derived distributions --- the pair-color distributions\nunder the two methods of getting a match. The output, a number we call the\ndiscrepancy of the input distribution, is the total variation distance between\nthe two derived distributions.\n  It is easy to determine when the two pair-color distributions come out equal,\nthat is, to determine which distributions have discrepancy zero, but hard to\ndetermine the largest possible discrepancy. We find the exact extreme for the\ncase of two colors, by analyzing the roots of a fifth degree polynomial in one\nvariable. We find the exact extreme for the case of three colors, by analyzing\nthe 49 roots of a variety spanned by two seventh-degree polynomials in two\nvariables. We give a plausible conjecture for the general situation of a finite\nnumber of colors, and give an exact computation of a constant which is a\nplausible candidate for the supremum of the discrepancy over all discrete\nprobability distributions.\n  We briefly consider the more difficult case where the objects to be matched\ninto pairs are of two different kinds, such as male-female or left-right.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 00:27:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2013 01:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

Therefore, the X-ray emission from lensed quasars is\nfirst strongly lensed by the black hole before it is lensed by the foreground\ngalaxy and star fields. We present a scheme that combines the initial strong\nlensing of a Kerr black hole with standard linearized microlensing by\nintervening stars. We find that X-ray microlensed light curves incorporating\nKerr strong gravity can differ significantly from standard curves. The\namplitude of the fluctuations in the light curves can increase or decrease by\n~0.65-0.75 mag by including Kerr strong gravity. Larger inclination angles give\nlarger amplitude fluctuations in the microlensing light curves. Consequently,\ncurrent X-ray microlensing observations might have under or overestimated the\nsizes of the X-ray emission regions. We estimate this bias using a simple\nmetric based on the amplitude of magnitude fluctuations. The half light radius\nof the X-ray emission region can be underestimated up to ~50% or overestimated\nup to ~20%. Underestimates are found in most situations we have investigated.\nThe only exception is for a disk with large spin, radially flat emission\nprofile, and observed nearly face on, where an overestimate is found. Thus,\nmore accurate microlensing size constraints should be obtainable by including\nKerr lensing. The caustic crossing time can differ by months after including\nKerr strong gravity. A simultaneous monitoring of gravitational lensed quasars\nin both X-ray and optical bands with densely sampled X-ray light curves might\nreveal this feature. We conclude that it should be possible to constrain\nimportant parameters such as inclination angles and black hole spins from\ncombined Kerr and microlensing effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 00:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Barnes et al. (2011) presented the source catalog of ~300 clumps based\non HCO+(1-0) emission, used to estimate masses M. Here we use archival\nmid-infrared to mm continuum data to construct spectral energy distributions.\nFitting two-temperature grey-body models, we derive bolometric luminosities, L.\nWe find the clumps have 10Lsun<L<1E6.5Lsun and 0.1<L/M<1E3, consistent with\ntheoretical expectations of a clump population that spans a range of\ninstantaneous star formation efficiencies from 0 to ~50%. We thus expect L/M to\nbe a useful, strongly-varying indicator of clump evolution during the star\ncluster formation process. We find correlations of the ratio of warm to cold\ncomponent fluxes and of cold component temperature with L/M. We also find a\nnear linear relation between L/M and Spitzer-IRAC specific intensity (surface\nbrightness), which may thus also be useful as a star formation efficiency\nindicator. The lower bound of the clump $L/M$ distribution suggests the star\nformation efficiency per free-fall time is epsilon<0.2. We do not find strong\ncorrelations of L/M with mass surface density, velocity dispersion or virial\nparameter. We find a linear relation between L and L_{HCO+(1-0}}, although with\nlarge scatter for any given individual clump.

The uncertainty in heterogeneous\nstructure properties is often parameterized by a high-dimensional random\nvariable. This leads to a deterministic problem in a high-dimensional parameter\nspace and the numerical computation becomes very challengeable as the dimension\nof the parameter space increases. To efficiently tackle the\nhigh-dimensionality, we propose a hybrid high dimensional model representation\n(HDMR) technique, through which the high-dimensional stochastic model is\ndecomposed into a moderate-dimensional stochastic model in a most active random\nspace and a few one-dimensional stochastic models. The derived low-dimensional\nstochastic models are solved by incorporating sparse grid stochastic\ncollocation method into the proposed hybrid HDMR. The porous media properties\nsuch as permeability are often heterogeneous. To treat the heterogeneity, we\nuse a mixed multiscale finite element method (MMsFEM) to simulate each of\nderived stochastic models. To capture the non-local spatial features of the\nporous media and the important effects of random variables, we can\nhierarchically incorporate the global information individually from each of\nrandom parameters. This significantly enhances the accuracy of the multiscale\nsimulation. The synergy of the hybrid HDMR and the MMsFEM reduces the\nstochastic model of flows in both stochastic space and physical space, and\nsignificantly decreases the computation complexity. We carefully analyze the\nproposed HDMR technique and the derived stochastic MMsFEM. A few numerical\nexperiments are carried out for two-phase flows in random porous media and\nsupport the efficiency and accuracy of the MMsFEM based on the hybrid HDMR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 03:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 09:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

Here, we develop a model of the contagious\nspread of information in a global-scale, publicly-articulated social network\nand show that a simple method can yield not just early detection, but advance\nwarning of contagious outbreaks. In this method, we randomly choose a small\nfraction of nodes in the network and then we randomly choose a \"friend\" of each\nnode to include in a group for local monitoring. Using six months of data from\nmost of the full Twittersphere, we show that this friend group is more central\nin the network and it helps us to detect viral outbreaks of the use of novel\nhashtags about 7 days earlier than we could with an equal-sized randomly chosen\ngroup. Moreover, the method actually works better than expected due to network\nstructure alone because highly central actors are both more active and exhibit\nincreased diversity in the information they transmit to others.

This assumption has been confirmed by\nSZ signal detection in hundreds of clusters but, in comparison with the huge\nnumbers of clusters within optically selected samples from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) data, this only accounts for a few per cent of clusters. Here we\nintroduce a model-independent new method to confirm the assumption that most\ngalaxy clusters can offer the thermal SZ signal as their main foreground\neffect. For the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year data\n(and a given galaxy cluster sample), we introduced a parameter d1 as the\nnearest-neighbour cluster angular distance of each pixel, then we classified\ndata pixels as 'to be' (d1--> 0 case) or 'not to be' (d1 large enough) affected\nby the sample clusters. By comparing the statistical results of these two kinds\nof pixels, we can see how the sample clusters affect the CMB data directly. We\nfind that the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample and X-ray samples\n(~10^2 clusters) can lead to obvious temperature depression in the WMAP\nseven-year data, which confirms the SZ effect prediction. However, each\noptically selected sample (>10^4 clusters) shows an opposite result: the mean\ntemperature rises to about 10uK. This unexpected qualitative scenario implies\nthat the main foreground effect of most clusters is $not$ always the expected\nSZ effect. This may be the reason why the SZ signal detection result is lower\nthan expected from the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 04:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 01:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 May 2013 07:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

This upper bound is more than seven orders of magnitude more\nstringent than the existing laboratory constraints for interaction ranges below\n1m, corresponding to a broad range of vector boson masses above $10^{-6}$ eV.\nMore sensitive searches for a $g_{V}g_{A}^{n}$ coupling could be performed\nusing neutron spin rotation measurements in heavy nuclei or through analysis of\nexperiments conducted to search for nucleon-nucleon weak interactions and\nnuclear anapole moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 05:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-20"}

The flux rope first appears as a twisted hot channel\nin the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 94 A and 131 A passbands. The twisted hot\nchannel initially lies along the polarity inversion line and then rises and\ndevelops into the semi-circular flux rope-like structure during the impulsive\nacceleration phase of CMEs. In the meantime, the rising hot channel compresses\nthe surrounding magnetic field and plasma, which successively stack into the\nCME LF. In this paper, we study in detail two well-observed CMEs occurred on\n2011 March 7 and 2011 March 8, respectively. Each of them is associated with an\nM-class flare. Through a kinematic analysis we find that: (1) the hot channel\nrises earlier than the first appearance of the CME LF and the onset of the\nassociated flare; (2) the speed of the hot channel is always faster than that\nof the LF, at least in the field of view of AIA. Thus, the hot channel acts as\na continuous driver of the CME formation and eruption in the early acceleration\nphase. Subsequently, the two CMEs in white-light images can be well reproduced\nby the graduated cylindrical shell flux rope model. These results suggest that\nthe pre-existing flux rope plays a key role in CME initiation and formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 05:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

At the same time, Dunkl operators are\nused to define a family of stochastic processes called Dunkl processes. We\nshowed in a previous paper that when the coupling constant of interaction of\nthe symmetric Dunkl process on the root system A(N-1) goes to infinity (the\nfreezing regime), its final configuration is proportional to the roots of the\nHermite polynomials. It is also known that the positions of the particles of\nthe Calogero-Moser system with particle exchange become fixed at the roots of\nthe Hermite polynomials in the freezing regime. Although both systems present a\nfreezing behaviour that depends on the roots of the Hermite polynomials, the\nreason for this similarity has been an open problem until now.

We investigate and propose a\ntriggering mechanism for the solar tornado observed in a prominence cavity by\nSDO/AIA on September 25, 2011. High-cadence EUV images from the SDO/AIA and the\nAhead spacecraft of STEREO/EUVI are used to correlate three flares in the\nneighbouring active-region (NOAA 11303), and their EUV waves, with the\ndynamical developments of the tornado. The timings of the flares and EUV waves\nobserved on-disk in 195\\AA\\ are analyzed in relation to the tornado activities\nobserved at the limb in 171\\AA. Each of the three flares and its related EUV\nwave occurred within 10 hours of the onset of the tornado. They have an\nobserved causal relationship with the commencement of activity in the\nprominence where the tornado develops. Tornado-like rotations along the side of\nthe prominence start after the second flare. The prominence cavity expands with\nacceleration of tornado motion after the third flare. Flares in the\nneighbouring active region may have affected the cavity prominence system and\ntriggered the solar tornado. A plausible mechanism is that the active-region\ncoronal field contracted by the `Hudson effect' due to the loss of magnetic\nenergy as flares. Subsequently the cavity expanded by its magnetic pressure to\nfill the surrounding low corona. We suggest that the tornado is the dynamical\nresponse of the helical prominence field to the cavity expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 10:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

At\nhigh input rates, shaped pulses interfere and the source spectrum, as well as\nintensity information, get distorted. For instruments using bipolar pulse\nshaping there are two aspects to consider: `peak' and `tail' pileup effects,\nwhich raise and lower the measured energy, respectively. Peak effects have been\nextensively modeled in the past. Tail effects have garnered less attention due\nto the increased complexity: bipolar tails mean the tail pulse-height\nmeasurement depends on events in more than one time interval. We leverage\nprevious work to derive an accurate, semi-analytical prediction for peak and\ntail pileup, up to high orders. We use the true pulse shape from the detectors\nof the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. The measured spectrum is calculated by\nwriting exposure time as a state-space expansion of overlapping pileup states\nand is valid up to very high rates. This expansion models losses due to fixed\nand extendable deadtime by averaging overlap configurations. Additionally, the\nmodel correctly predicts energy-dependent losses due to tail subtraction\n(sub-threshold) effects.

Observations toward IRAS 16293-2422 of\nthe 5(3,2)-4(4,1) transition of H2-18O at 692.07914 GHz from Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as well as the 3(1,3)-2(2,0) of H2-18O at\n203.40752 GHz and the 3(1,2)-2(2,1) transition of HDO at 225.89672 GHz from the\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA) are presented. The 692 GHz H2-18O line is seen toward\nboth components of the binary protostar. Toward one of the components, \"source\nB\", the line is seen in absorption toward the continuum, slightly red-shifted\nfrom the systemic velocity, whereas emission is seen off-source at the systemic\nvelocity. Toward the other component, \"source A\", the two HDO and H2-18O lines\nare detected as well with the SMA. From the H2-18O transitions the excitation\ntemperature is estimated at 124 +/- 12 K. The calculated HDO/H2O ratio is (9.2\n+/- 2.6)*10^(-4) - significantly lower than previous estimates in the warm gas\nclose to the source. It is also lower by a factor of ~5 than the ratio deduced\nin the outer envelope. Our observations reveal the physical and chemical\nstructure of water vapor close to the protostars on solar-system scales. The\nred-shifted absorption detected toward source B is indicative of infall. The\nexcitation temperature is consistent with the picture of water ice evaporation\nclose to the protostar.

Many studies on complex networks focus on the characteristics\nof vertices, which are always proved to follow the power law. However, few\nresearches have been done on edges in directed networks. In this paper, edge\nbalance ratio is firstly proposed to measure the balance property of edges in\ndirected networks. Based on edge balance ratio, balance profile and positivity\nare put forward to describe the balance level of the whole network. Then the\ndistribution of edge balance ratio is theoretically analyzed. In a directed\nnetwork whose vertex in-degree follows the power law with scaling exponent\n$\\gamma$, it is proved that the edge balance ratio follows a piecewise power\nlaw, with the scaling exponent of each section linearly dependents on $\\gamma$.\nThe theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulations.

We focus\nour attention both on the study of the generation and possible breakup of the\nsplash wave created after the impact and on the calculation of the force on the\ndisc. We have experimentally found that drops are only ejected from the rim\nlocated at the top part of the splash --giving rise to what is known as the\ncrown splash-- if the impact Weber number exceeds a threshold value\n$\\Weber_{crit}\\simeq 140$. We explain this threshold by defining a local Bond\nnumber $Bo_{tip}$ based on the rim deceleration and its radius of curvature,\nwith which we show using both numerical simulations and experiments that a\ncrown splash only occurs when $Bo_{tip}\\gtrsim 1$, revealing that the rim\ndisrupts due to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Neglecting the effect of air, we\nshow that the flow in the region close to the disc edge possesses a\nWeber-number-dependent self-similar structure for every Weber number. From this\nwe demonstrate that $\\Bond_{tip}\\propto\\Weber$, explaining both why the\ntransition to crown splash can be characterized in terms of the impact Weber\nnumber and why this transition occurs for $We_{crit}\\simeq 140$.\n  Next, including the effect of air, we have developed a theory which predicts\nthe time-varying thickness of the very thin air cushion that is entrapped\nbetween the impacting solid and the liquid. Our analysis reveals that gas\ncritically affect the velocity of propagation of the splash wave as well as the\ntime-varying force on the disc, $F_D$. The existence of the air layer also\nlimits the range of times in which the self-similar solution is valid and,\naccordingly, the maximum deceleration experienced by the liquid rim, what sets\nthe length scale of the splash drops ejected when $We>\\Weber_{crit}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 15:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 21:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

They can\nresolve a large range of time and length scales, and admit exact numerical\nintegration. We use such models to study how non-linear clustering depends on\ninitial conditions and cosmology. More specifically, we consider a family of\nmodels which, like the 3D EdS model, lead for power-law initial conditions to\nself-similar clustering characterized in the strongly non-linear regime by\npower-law behaviour of the two point correlation function. We study how the\ncorresponding exponent \\gamma depends on the initial conditions, characterized\nby the exponent n of the power spectrum of initial fluctuations, and on a\nsingle parameter \\kappa controlling the rate of expansion. The space of initial\nconditions/cosmology divides very clearly into two parts: (1) a region in which\n\\gamma depends strongly on both n and \\kappa and where it agrees very well with\na simple generalisation of the so-called stable clustering hypothesis in three\ndimensions, and (2) a region in which \\gamma is more or less independent of\nboth the spectrum and the expansion of the universe. We explain the observed\nlocation of the boundary in (n, \\kappa) space dividing the \"stable clustering\"\nregion from the \"universal\" region. We compare and contrast our findings to\nresults in three dimensions, and discuss in particular the light they may throw\non the question of \"universality\" of non-linear clustering in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 15:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 13:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
