When a non-improved action is used, a rapid crossover\nis observed at small bare quark masses. Our results confirm a first order\nnature for this transition, in agreement with previous results we obtained\nusing an improved action. As shown in Ref.[1], when improvement of the action\nis used, the transition is preceded by a second rapid crossover at weaker\ncoupling and an exotic phase emerges, where chiral symmetry is not yet broken.\nThis can be explained [1] by the non hermiticity of the improved lattice\nTransfer matrix, arising from the competition of nearest-neighbor and\nnon-nearest neighbor interactions, the latter introduced by improvement and\nbecoming increasingly relevant at strong coupling and coarse lattices.

The linear theory of a\nnoninteracting Fermi gas is reviewed and several consistency constraints are\nverified. The challenge to formulate linear response theories of BCS\nsuperfluids consistent with density and spin conservation laws comes from the\npresence of a broken U(1)$_{\\textrm{EM}}$ symmetry associated with\nelectromagnetism (EM) and we discuss two routes for circumventing this. The\nfirst route follows Nambu's integral-equation approach for the EM vertex\nfunction, but this method is not specific for BCS superfluids. We focus on the\nsecond route based on a consistent-fluctuation-of-the order-parameter (CFOP)\napproach where the gauge transformation and the fluctuations of the order\nparameter are treated on equal footing. The CFOP approach allows one to\nexplicitly verify several important constraints: The EM vertex satisfies not\nonly a Ward identity which guarantees charge conservation but also a $Q$-limit\nWard identity associated with the compressibility sum rule. In contrast, the\nspin degrees of freedom associated with another U(1)$_z$ symmetry are not\naffected by the Cooper-pair condensation that breaks only the\nU(1)$_{\\textrm{EM}}$ symmetry. As a consequence the collective modes from the\nfluctuations of the order parameter only couple to the density response\nfunction but decouple from the spin response function, which reflects the\ndifferent fates of the two U(1) symmetries in the superfluid phase. Our\nformulation lays the ground work for application to more general theories of\nBCS-Bose Einstein Condensation crossover both above and below $T_c$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 17:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 01:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 15:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-04"}

EuNiGe3 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric\nbody-centered tetragonal BaNiSn3-type structure. The physical property data\nconsistently demonstrate that this is a metallic system in which Eu spins S =\n7/2 order antiferromagnetically at a temperature TN = 13.6 K. Magnetic\nsusceptibility chi data for T > TN indicate that the Eu atoms have spin 7/2\nwith g = 2, that the Ni atoms are nonmagnetic, and that the dominant\ninteractions between the Eu spins are ferromagnetic. Thus we propose that\nEuNiGe3 has a collinear A-type antiferromagnetic structure. A fit of chi(T <\nTN) by our molecular field theory is consistent with a collinear magnetic\nstructure. Electrical resistivity rho data from TN to 350 K are fitted by the\nBloch-Gruneisen model for electron-phonon scattering, yielding a Debye\ntemperature of 265(2) K. A strong decrease in rho occurs below TN due to loss\nof spin-disorder scattering.

For\nexample, changes in gene expression can provide insight into developmental and\nphysiological mechanisms that link genotype and phenotype. However, classical\nanalytical techniques are poorly suited to quantitative genetic studies of gene\nexpression where the number of traits assayed per individual can reach many\nthousand. Here, we derive a Bayesian genetic sparse factor model for estimating\nthe genetic covariance matrix (G-matrix) of high-dimensional traits, such as\ngene expression, in a mixed effects model. The key idea of our model is that we\nneed only consider G-matrices that are biologically plausible. An organism's\nentire phenotype is the result of processes that are modular and have limited\ncomplexity. This implies that the G-matrix will be highly structured. In\nparticular, we assume that a limited number of intermediate traits (or factors,\ne.g., variations in development or physiology) control the variation in the\nhigh-dimensional phenotype, and that each of these intermediate traits is\nsparse -- affecting only a few observed traits. The advantages of this approach\nare two-fold. First, sparse factors are interpretable and provide biological\ninsight into mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture. Second, enforcing\nsparsity helps prevent sampling errors from swamping out the true signal in\nhigh-dimensional data. We demonstrate the advantages of our model on simulated\ndata and in an analysis of a published Drosophila melanogaster gene expression\ndata set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 19:41:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 23:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-03"}

Specifically, we propose a novel framework based on level-triggered\nsampling, a non-uniform sampling strategy, and sequential estimation. The\nproposed estimator can be used as an asymptotically optimal fixed-sample-size\ndecentralized estimator under non-fading listening channels (through which\nsensors collect their observations), as an alternative to the one-shot\nestimators commonly found in the literature. It can also be used as an\nasymptotically optimal sequential decentralized estimator under fading\nlistening channels. We show that the optimal centralized estimator under\nGaussian noise is characterized by two processes, namely the observed Fisher\ninformation U_t, and the observed correlation V_t. It is noted that under\nnon-fading listening channels only V_t is random, whereas under fading\nlistening channels both U_t and V_t are random. In the proposed scheme, each\nsensor computes its local random process(es), and sends a single bit to the\nfusion center (FC) whenever the local random process(es) pass(es) certain\npredefined levels. The FC, upon receiving a bit from a sensor, updates its\napproximation to the corresponding global random process, and accordingly its\nestimate. The sequential estimation process terminates when the observed Fisher\ninformation (or the approximation to it) reaches a target value. We provide an\nasymptotic analysis for the proposed estimator and also the one based on\nconventional uniform-in-time sampling under both non-fading and fading\nchannels; and determine the conditions under which they are asymptotically\noptimal, consistent, and asymptotically unbiased. Analytical results, together\nwith simulation results, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed estimator\nbased on level-triggered sampling over the traditional decentralized estimator\nbased on uniform sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 20:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2013 17:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

In this paper, we explore how the mutual inclination between\nthe planetary and binary orbits may reflect the physical conditions of the\nassembly of protoplanetary disks and the interaction between protostellar\nbinaries and circumbinary disks. Given the turbulent nature of star-forming\nmolecular clouds, it is possible that the gas falling onto the outer region of\na circumbinary disk and the central protostellar binary have different axes of\nrotation. Thus, the newly assembled circumbinary disk can be misaligned with\nrespect to the binary. However, the gravitational torque from the binary\nproduces a warp and twist in the disk, and the back-reaction torque tends to\nalign the disk and the binary orbital plane. We present a new, analytic\ncalculation of this alignment torque, and show that the binary-disk inclination\nangle can be reduced appreciably after the binary accretes a few percent of its\nmass from the disk. Our calculation suggests that in the absence of other\ndisturbances, circumbinary disks and planets around close (sub-AU) stellar\nbinaries, for which mass accretion onto the proto-binary is very likely to have\noccurred, are expected to be highly aligned with the binary orbits, while disks\nand planets around wide binaries can be misaligned. Measurements of the mutual\ninclinations of circumbinary planetary systems can provide a clue to the birth\nenvironments of such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 20:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2013 15:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

Small-scale variations in particle\nintensities(dropouts) and velocity dispersions can be reproduced. The result\ngives a constraint on the error of onset analysis for inferring SEP\ninformations. We find that dropouts are rarely produced using the two-component\nmodel(Matthaeus et al., 1990). The result questions the turbulence model.\nChapter 3 studies the acceleration of ions. We use 3-D hybrid simulations to\nstudy the acceleration of low-energy particles at parallel shocks. We find that\nparticles gain energy by reflection at the shock. The protons can move off\nfield lines in 3-D electric and magnetic fields. We also use a stochastic\nintegration method to study diffusive shock acceleration including large-scale\nmagnetic variations. The results can explain the observations of anomalous\ncosmic rays by Voyager 1. Chapter 4 studies electron acceleration at a shock in\na turbulent magnetic field by combining hybrid simulations and test-particle\nsimulations. The acceleration is enhanced by including large-scale turbulence.\nSince electrons mainly follow field lines, the field-line braiding allows\nelectrons interacting with shock many times. Ripples also contribute to\nacceleration by mirroring electrons. The process favors perpendicular shocks.\nWe discuss the implication to SEPs by comparing the acceleration of electrons\nwith that of protons. The intensity correlation of electrons and ions in SEPs\nimplies perpendicular shocks play important roles in accelerating particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 20:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}

Not so much because of still large uncertainties in the\nmeasurements but as the result of several almost degenerate minima in the\ncoupling profile likelihood function. To break these degeneracies, it is\nimportant to identify and measure processes where the Higgs coupling to\nfermions interferes with other coupling(s). The most prominent example, the\ndecay of $h \\to \\gamma \\gamma$, is not sufficient to give a definitive answer.\nIn this Letter, we argue that $t$-channel single top production in association\nwith a Higgs boson, with $h\\to b\\bar b$, can provide the necessary information\nto lift the remaining degeneracy in the top Yukawa. Within the Standard Model,\nthe total rate is highly reduced due to an almost perfect destructive\ninterference in the hard process, $W b \\rightarrow t h$.

Determining the natal rotation-rate distribution\nof stars is of high priority given its importance as a constraint on theories\nof massive star formation and as input for models of stellar populations in the\nlocal Universe and at high redshift. Recently, it has become clear that the\nmajority of massive stars interact with a binary companion before they die. We\ninvestigate how this affects the distribution of rotation rates.\n  For this purpose, we simulate a massive binary-star population typical for\nour Galaxy assuming continuous star formation. We find that, because of binary\ninteraction, 20^+5_-10% of all massive main-sequence stars have projected\nrotational velocities in excess of 200km/s. We evaluate the effect of uncertain\ninput distributions and physical processes and conclude that the main\nuncertainties are the mass transfer efficiency and the possible effect of\nmagnetic braking, especially if magnetic fields are generated or amplified\nduring mass accretion and stellar mergers.\n  The fraction of rapid rotators we derive is similar to that observed. If\nindeed mass transfer and mergers are the main cause for rapid rotation in\nmassive stars, little room remains for rapidly rotating stars that are born\nsingle. This implies that spin down during star formation is even more\nefficient than previously thought. In addition, this raises questions about the\ninterpretation of the surface abundances of rapidly rotating stars as evidence\nfor rotational mixing. Furthermore, our results allow for the possibility that\nall early-type Be stars result from binary interactions and suggest that\nevidence for rotation in explosions, such as long gamma-ray bursts, points to a\nbinary origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 22:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We assume\nthat the ultimate collapse of the supermassive star leads to the rapid\nformation of a black hole of 10^5 Msun following a quasi-star stage. Using a\nmodel for galaxy formation applied to the outputs of the Millennium Simulation,\nwe show that the conditions required for this massive black hole formation\nroute to take place in the concordance LambdaCDM model are actually common at\nhigh redshift, and can be realized even at low redshift. Most major mergers\nabove z~4 in haloes with mass > 10^{11} Msun can lead to the formation of a\nmassive seed and, at z~2, the fraction of favourable mergers decreases to about\nhalf. Interestingly, we find that even in the local universe a fraction (~20%)\nof major mergers in massive haloes still satisfy the conditions for our massive\nblack hole formation route.

We present a suite of models that predict, the\ndependence of MgII absorption on a galaxy's apparent inclination, impact\nparameter(b) and azimuthal angle. The variations in the absorption strength\nwith azimuthal angles provide much stronger constraints on the intrinsic\ngeometry of the MgII absorption than the dependence on the galaxy's\ninclination. Strong MgII absorbers (W_r(2796)>0.3) are asymmetrically\ndistributed in azimuth around their host galaxies:72% of the absorbers studied\nand 100% of the close-in absorbers within b<35 kpc, are located within 50deg of\nthe host galaxy's projected minor axis.

The single softened cone model has\nan exponential fall off with azimuth with an exponential scale-length in\nopening angle of 45deg. We conclude that the distribution of MgII gas at low\nimpact parameters is not the same as that found at high impact parameters.

Beyond 40 kpc, there is evidence for a more symmetric distribution,\nsignificantly different from that closer into the galaxies.

We show how the\nviscous coupling between the immersed structures and the fluid can be\nsimplified in the regime where this coupling becomes increasingly strong. Many\ndescriptions in fluid mechanics and in the formulation of computational methods\naccount for fluid-structure interactions through viscous drag terms to transfer\nmomentum from the fluid to immersed structures. In the inertial regime, this\ncoupling often introduces a prohibitively small time-scale into the temporal\ndynamics of the fluid-structure system. This is further exacerbated in the\npresence of thermal fluctuations. We discuss here a systematic reduction\ntechnique for the full inertial equations to obtain a simplified description\nwhere this coupling term is eliminated.

For $AA$ stacking, we do not\nfind any topological insulator phase in the presence of large Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. When the exchange field is also turned on, the bilayer system\nexhibits a rich variety of topological phases including a quantum anomalous\nHall phase, and we obtain the phase diagram as a function of the Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling, interlayer potential difference, and exchange field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 06:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-08"}

An alternative to assuming independent errors is to allow for\ndependence along each dimension of the array using a separable covariance\nmodel. However, the number of parameters in this model increases rapidly with\nthe dimensions of the array and, for many arrays, maximum likelihood estimates\nof the covariance parameters do not exist. In this paper, we propose a submodel\nof the separable covariance model that estimates the covariance matrix for each\ndimension as having factor analytic structure. This model can be viewed as an\nextension of factor analysis to array-valued data, as it uses a factor model to\nestimate the covariance along each dimension of the array. We discuss\nproperties of this model as they relate to ordinary factor analysis, describe\nmaximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation methods, and provide a likelihood\nratio testing procedure for selecting the factor model ranks.

Another important feature is that\nthe recovered solution is of a better quality than the FE solution and can\ntherefore be used as an enhanced solution. We have developed an SPR-type\nrecovery technique that considers equilibrium and displacements constraints to\nobtain a very accurate recovered displacements field from which a recovered\nstress field can also be evaluated. We propose the use of these recovered\nfields as the standard output of the FE code instead of the raw FE solution.\nTechniques to quantify the error of the recovered solution are therefore\nneeded. In this report we present an error estimation technique that accurately\nevaluates the error of the recovered solution both at global and local levels\nin the FEM and XFEM frameworks. We have also developed an h-adaptive mesh\nrefinement strategy based on the error of the recovered solution. As the\nconverge rate of the error of the recovered solution is higher than that of the\nFE one, the computational cost required to obtain a solution with a prescribed\naccuracy is smaller than for traditional h-adaptive processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 08:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-19"}

This is observed in many ASDEX\nUpgrade discharges. The present work aims to understand the underlying\nresonance mechanisms, especially in the presence of multiple modes with\ndifferent frequencies. Resonant mode coupling mechanisms are investigated using\nthe drift kinetic HAGIS code [Pinches 1998]. Simulations were performed for\ndifferent plasma equilibria, in particular for different q profiles, employing\nthe availability of improved experimental data. A study was carried out,\ninvestigating double-resonant mode coupling with respect to various overlapping\nscenarios. It was found that, depending on the radial mode distance,\ndouble-resonance is able to enhance growth rates as well as mode amplitudes\nsignificantly. Small radial mode distances, however can also lead to strong\nnonlinear mode stabilization of a linear dominant mode. With the extended\nversion of HAGIS, losses were simulated and directly compared with experimental\nloss measurements. The losses' phase space distribution as well as their\nejection signal is consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, it allowed\nto characterize them as prompt, resonant or stochastic. It was found that\nespecially in multiple mode scenarios (with different mode frequencies),\nabundant incoherent losses occur in the lower energy range, due to a broad\nphase-space stochastization. The incoherent higher energetic losses are\n\"prompt\", i.e. their initial energy is too large for confined orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 09:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-07"}

The\npurpose of this work is to determine whether or not the simulation results\nagree with Taylor relaxation, which will require a modified version of\nrelaxation theory applicable to unbounded field configurations. Methods: A\nthree-dimensional (3D) MHD Lagrangian-remap code is used to simulate the\nevolution of a line-tied cylindrical coronal loop model. This model comprises\nthree concentric layers surrounded by a potential envelope; hence, being\ntwisted locally, each loop configuration is distinguished by a\npiecewise-constant current profile.

At such a low metallicity,\nthe HBB temperatures (well above 108K) allow a very advanced nucleosynthesis.\nMasses of about 6Mo deplete Mg and synthesize Si, going beyond Al, so this\nlatter element results only moderately enhanced; sodium can not be enhanced.\nThe models are consistent with the observations, although the predicted Mg\ndepletion is not as strong as in the observed stars.

Finally, we speculate that some calcium production\nis occurring owing to proton capture on potassium. We emphasize the importance\nof a strong effort to measure a larger sample of abundances in this cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 11:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

An arbitrary choice\nof the parametrization of the metric and the matter field redefinition does not\npreserve the effective Lorentz invariance of the local dynamics. As for the\neffect of different parametrization of the metric alone, the effective Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking term can be eliminated by shifting the background metric.

The effective Lorentz invariance can be retained only when we adopt the\nspecific matter field redefinitions where all dimensionless couplings become\nscale invariant at the classical level.

The target group is not\nprimarily deaf children, but children with language disorders. Using sign\nlanguage as a support in conversation has been shown to greatly stimulate the\nspeech development of such children. The signer is captured with an RGB-D\n(Kinect) sensor, which has three advantages over a regular RGB camera. Firstly,\nit allows complex backgrounds to be removed easily. We segment the hands and\nface based on skin color and depth information. Secondly, it helps with the\nresolution of hand over face occlusion. Thirdly, signs take place in 3D; some\naspects of the signs are defined by hand motion vertically to the image plane.\nThis motion can be estimated if the depth is observable. The 3D motion of the\nhands relative to the torso are used as a cue together with the hand shape, and\nHMMs trained with this input are used for classification. To obtain higher\nrobustness towards differences across signers, Fisher Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis is used to find the combinations of features that are most descriptive\nfor each sign, regardless of signer.

Although,\nATLAS simulations to determine current and other short channel effects in this\ndevice have been demonstrated in recent literature, C-V & Ballistic I-V\ncharacterizations by using self-consistent method are yet to be reported. C-V\ncharacteristic of this device is investigated here with the variation of bottom\ngate voltage. The depletion to accumulation transition point (i.e. Threshold\nvoltage) of the C-V curve should shift in the positive direction when the\nbottom gate is negatively biased and our simulation results validate this\nphenomenon. Ballistic performance of this device has also been studied with the\nvariation of top gate voltage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 04:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}
