The main technical difficulty in this program lies\nin describing the links of singularities in this cobordism arising from the\nSeiberg-Witten moduli subspaces. In related articles, we defined maps which,\nessentially, define normal bundles of strata of these singularities. The link\nin question is then the boundary of the union of the tubular neighborhoods\nassociated with these normal bundles. However, the SO(3)-monopole program\nrequires the computation of intersection numbers with links where more than one\nstratum appears in the family of singularities and thus more than one tubular\nneighborhood appears in the definition of the link.

We aim at theoretically studying the formation and the deuteration of\nwater, which is believed to be formed on interstellar grain surfaces in\nmolecular clouds. Methods. We used our gas-grain astrochemical model GRAINOBLE,\nwhich considers the multilayer formation of interstellar ices. We varied\nseveral input parameters to study their impact on water deuteration.

The\nuse of a multilayer approach allowed us to study the influence of various\nparameters on the abundance and the deuteration of water. Deuteration of water\nis found to be very sensitive to the ortho-to-para ratio of H2 and to the total\ndensity, but it also depends on the gas/grain temperatures and the visual\nextinction of the cloud. Since the deuteration is very sensitive to the\nphysical conditions, the comparison with sub-millimetric observation towards\nthe low-mass protostar IRAS 16293 allows us to suggest that water ice is formed\ntogether with CO2 in molecular clouds with limited density, whilst formaldehyde\nand methanol are mainly formed in a later phase, where the condensation becomes\ndenser and colder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 18:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 18:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

One well-studied procedure for selecting a winner is\nto specify a complete binary tree whose leaves are labeled by the candidates,\nand evaluate it by running pairwise elections between the pairs of leaves,\nsending the winners to successive rounds of pairwise elections which ultimately\nterminate with a single winner. This structure is called a voting tree.\n  Much research has investigated which functions on tournaments are computable\nin this way. Fischer, Procaccia, and Samorodnitsky quantitatively studied the\ncomputability of the Copeland rule, which returns a vertex of maximum\nout-degree in the given tournament.

There is no detailed model for alpha, so it is\nusually taken to be a constant. However, global simulations of\nmagnetohydrodynamic disks find that alpha varies with distance from the central\nobject. Also, Newtonian simulations tend to find smaller alpha's than general\nrelativistic simulations. We seek a one-dimensional model for alpha that can\nreproduce these two observations. We are guided by data from six general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion disk simulations. The variation of\nalpha in the inner, laminar regions of the flow results from stretching of mean\nmagnetic field lines by the flow. The variation of alpha in the outer,\nturbulent regions results from the dependence of the magnetorotational\ninstability on the dimensionless shear rate. We give a one-dimensional\nprescription for alpha(r) that captures these two effects and reproduces the\nradial variation of alpha observed in the simulations. For thin disks, the\nprescription simplifies to the formula alpha(r)=0.025[q(r)/1.5]^6, where the\nshear parameter, q(r), is an analytical function of radius in the Kerr metric.\nThe coefficient and exponent are inferred from our simulations and will change\nas better simulation data becomes available. We conclude that the\nalpha-viscosity prescription can be extended to the radially varying alpha's\nobserved in simulations. It is possible that Newtonian simulations find smaller\nalpha's than general relativistic simulations because the shear parameter is\nlower in Newtonian flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 19:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It is debated\nwhether the typical hot Jupiter smoothly migrated inward from its formation\nlocation through the proto-planetary disk or was perturbed by another body onto\na highly eccentric orbit, which tidal dissipation subsequently shrank and\ncircularized during close stellar passages. Socrates and collaborators\npredicted that the latter class of model should produce a population of\nsuper-eccentric proto-hot Jupiters readily observable by Kepler. We find a\npaucity of such planets in the Kepler sample, inconsistent with the theoretical\nprediction with 96.9% confidence. Observational effects are unlikely to explain\nthis discrepancy. We find that the fraction of hot Jupiters with orbital period\nP > 3 days produced by the star-planet Kozai mechanism does not exceed (at\ntwo-sigma) 44%. Our results may indicate that disk migration is the dominant\nchannel for producing hot Jupiters with P > 3 days. Alternatively, the typical\nhot Jupiter may have been perturbed to a high eccentricity by interactions with\na planetary rather than stellar companion and began tidal circularization much\ninterior to 1 AU after multiple scatterings. A final alternative is that tidal\ncircularization occurs much more rapidly early in the tidal circularization\nprocess at high eccentricities than later in the process at low eccentricities,\ncontrary to current tidal theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 20:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 20:18:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 20:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

We propose an improved formalism free from the\ndouble-counting of electron correlation in the low-energy degrees of freedom.\nIn this approach, the exchange-correlation energy in the local density\napproximation (LDA) is replaced with the constrained self-energy corrections\ndefined by the sum of the contribution from eliminated high-energy degrees of\nfreedom, Sigma H and that from the frequency-dependent part of the partially\nscreened interaction, Delta Sigma L. We apply the formalism to SrVO3 as well as\nto two iron-based superconductors, FeSe and FeTe. The resultant bandwidths of\nthe effective models are nearly the same as those of the previous downfolding\nformalism because of striking cancellations of Sigma H and Delta Sigma L. In\nSrVO3, the resultant bandwidth of the effective low-energy model is 2.56 eV (in\ncomparison to LDA: 2.58 eV, full GW approximation: 2.19 eV). However, in the\nnon-degenerate multi-band materials such as FeSe and FeTe, the momentum\ndependent self-energy effects yield substantial modifications of the band\nstructures and relative shifts of orbital-energy levels of the effective\nmodels. The FeSe model indicates a substantial downward shift of the x2-y2\norbital level, which may lead to an increase in the filling of the x2-y2\norbital above half filling. It suggests a destruction of the orbital selective\nMott phase of the x2-y2 orbital in agreement with the experimental absence of\nthe antiferromagnetic phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2012 06:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-25"}

Thyroid nodule may presage the emergence of thyroid cancer. The thyroid\nnodule can be completely cured if detected early. Fine needle aspiration\ncytology is a recognized early diagnosis method of thyroid nodule. There are\nstill some limitations in the fine needle aspiration cytology, and the\nultrasound diagnosis of thyroid nodule has become the first choice for\nauxiliary examination of thyroid nodular disease. If we could combine medical\nimaging technology and fine needle aspiration cytology, the diagnostic rate of\nthyroid nodule would be improved significantly. The properties of ultrasound\nwill degrade the image quality, which makes it difficult to recognize the edges\nfor physicians. Image segmentation technique based on graph theory has become a\nresearch hotspot at present. Normalized cut (Ncut) is a representative one,\nwhich is suitable for segmentation of feature parts of medical image. However,\nhow to solve the normalized cut has become a problem, which needs large memory\ncapacity and heavy calculation of weight matrix. It always generates over\nsegmentation or less segmentation which leads to inaccurate in the\nsegmentation. The speckle noise in B ultrasound image of thyroid tumor makes\nthe quality of the image deteriorate. In the light of this characteristic, we\ncombine the anisotropic diffusion model with the normalized cut in this paper.\nAfter the enhancement of anisotropic diffusion model, it removes the noise in\nthe B ultrasound image while preserves the important edges and local details.\nThis reduces the amount of computation in constructing the weight matrix of the\nimproved normalized cut and improves the accuracy of the final segmentation\nresults. The feasibility of the method is proved by the experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Nov 2012 06:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

A pronounced\nFriedel-oscillation-like dependence of the coupling magnitude on the impurity\nposition within the nanoribbon resulting from quantum size effects is found and\ninvestigated.

Regression, Fourier-Transform based\nalgorithms, Kernel SVM and Kernel ridge regression) operate by reducing the\nproblem to a convex optimization problem over a vector space of functions.\nThese methods offer the currently best approach to several central problems\nsuch as learning half spaces and learning DNF's. In addition they are widely\nused in numerous application domains. Despite their importance, there are still\nvery few proof techniques to show limits on the power of these algorithms.\n  We study the performance of this approach in the problem of (agnostically and\nimproperly) learning halfspaces with margin $\\gamma$. Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be a\ndistribution over labeled examples. The $\\gamma$-margin error of a hyperplane\n$h$ is the probability of an example to fall on the wrong side of $h$ or at a\ndistance $\\le\\gamma$ from it. The $\\gamma$-margin error of the best $h$ is\ndenoted $\\mathrm{Err}_\\gamma(\\mathcal{D})$.
