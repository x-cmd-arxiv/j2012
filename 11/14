The most\npromising approach for realizing such magical cloaking in our real world would\nbe to use transformation optics, where an empty space with a distorted geometry\nis imitated with a non-distorted space but filled with transformation medium\nhaving appropriate permittivity and permeability. An important requirement for\ntrue invisibility cloaks is nonreciprocity; that is, a person in the cloak\nshould not be seen from the outside but should be able to see the outside.

Asteroids of C-type\nand close BGF-types could form from hydrated silicate-organic matter\naccumulated in the cores of water-differentiated (due to 26Al and other\nshort-lived isotopes decay) bodies existed in the growth zones of Jupiter.\nGravitational scattering of such bodies by Jupiter at its final stage of\nformation to the main asteroid belt might have led to fragmentation and\nre-accretion of their primitive materials on the surfaces of many asteroids\nand/or asteroid parent bodies. The hypothesis makes clear a row of\nlong-standing puzzling facts, the main of which are as follows. The low-albedo\nand carbonaceous-chondritic surface properties of (1) Ceres contradict to its\nprobable differentiated structure and icy crust (e. g., Thomas et al., 2005,\nNature 437: 224-226; Castillo-Rogez et al., 2010, Icarus 205, 443-459), but it\ncould be explained by the process of primitive matter fall. Atypical hydrated\nsilicates (probably, as a component of carbonaceous-chondritic matter) are\nfound on the surfaces of many asteroids of high-temperature types (Rivkin et\nal., 1995, Icarus 117: 90-100; Rivkin et al., 2000, Icarus 145: 351-368;\nBusarev, 1998, Icarus 131: 32-40; Busarev, 2002, Solar System Research 36:\n39-47) that may be a consequence of the carbonaceous-chondritic matter\nprecipitation on their surfaces. Some carbonaceous chondrites are\nunidirectionly magnetized (e. g., Stacey et al., 1961, J. Geophys. Res. 66:\n1523-1534; Butler, 1972, Earth Planet. Sci.

This paper presents an\napproach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is\nbased on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is\nequivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer\nvectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum\nlikelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely\nunique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood\nsolution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is \"close\" to the actual\nnodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem\nat hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates,\nfor which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that\nthe method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., {\\sigma} =\n30{\\deg} on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors\ncommonly used in mapping. For most range-finder-based scenarios, the\nmulti-hypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the\nproblem is very well constrained. Finally, using the orientations estimate\nprovided by our method to bootstrap the initial guess of pose graph\noptimization methods improves their robustness and makes them avoid local\nminima even for high levels of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 18:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-14"}

The underlying broad-line profiles in AGN are Lorentzian profiles caused\nby turbulence in the line emitting region. The turbulent velocities are\ndifferent for the different line emitting regions of Ha, Hg, Lya, CIII] 1909,\nHe II 1640, and Si IV 1400. The turbulent velocities go from 400 km/s for Hb up\nto 3,800 km/s for Lya+Nv 1240. The dominating broadening mechanism of these\nprofiles is broadening due to rotation. The rotation velocities causing the\nline profile broadening go from 500 km/s up to 6,500 km/s. Here we present\ninterrelations between observed emission line widths (FWHM) and their related\nrotational velocities to correct for the contribution of the turbulence to the\nbroad-line profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 18:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The light curve indicates that the\nobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significant\nportion of the decaying phase. The exponential decay time was determined to be\n$13\\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from a\nTeV blazar. The gamma-ray spectrum of BL Lacertae during the flare was soft,\nwith a photon index of $3.6\\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurement\nmade previously by MAGIC in a lower flaring state. Contemporaneous radio\nobservations of the source with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) revealed\nthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time of\nthe TeV gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarization\nangle. Changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, UV, and GeV\ngamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult to\nquantify precisely due to sparse coverage.

This type of\ncomplicated dynamics can affect our interpretation of observed planetary\nsystems that are in or near mean motion resonance. This work shows that\nplanetary systems in (near) mean motion resonance can exhibit nodding behavior,\nand outlines the portion of parameter space where it occurs. This problem is\naddressed using both full numerical integrations of the planetary systems and\nvia model equations obtained through expansions of the disturbing function. In\nthe latter approach, we identify the relevant terms that allow for nodding.

As a\nresult, the nodding phenomenon can be important for interpreting observations\nof transit timing variations, where the existence of smaller bodies is inferred\nthrough their effects on larger, observed transiting planets. For example, in\nactively nodding planetary systems, both the amplitude and frequency of the\ntransit timing variations depend on the observational time window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 19:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Here, I argue that there exists an economic constant that\ncarries through time, and that this can help us to anticipate the more distant\nfuture: global economic wealth has a fixed link to civilization's overall rate\nof energy consumption from all sources; the ratio of these two quantities has\nnot changed over the past 40 years that statistics are available. Power\nproduction and wealth rise equally quickly because civilization, like any other\nsystem in the universe, must consume and dissipate its energy reserves in order\nto sustain its current size. One perspective might be that financial wealth\nmust ultimately collapse as we deplete our energy reserves. However, we can\nalso expect that highly aggregated quantities like global wealth have inertia,\nand that growth rates must persist. Exceptionally rapid innovation in the two\ndecades following 1950 allowed for unprecedented acceleration of\ninflation-adjusted rates of return. But today, real innovation rates are more\nstagnant. This means that, over the coming decade or so, global GDP and wealth\nshould rise fairly steadily at an inflation-adjusted rate of about 2.2% per\nyear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 20:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-14"}

Compared to a\nlognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders of\nmagnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). This\nis true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excluding\nmagnetic fields. Deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter T\nthat increases with the compressive Mach number. The proposed distribution can\nbe derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)\nvelocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,\nand we provide a simple interpretation of the density PDF as the product of a\ncontinuous-time relaxation process. As such the parameter T is consistent with\nthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure\nfunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more\nintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks. It provides a new\nand unique probe of the role of intermittency in the density (not just\nvelocity) structure of turbulence. We show that this naturally explains some\napparent contradictory results in the literature based on use of different\nmoments of the density PDF, as well as differences based on whether\nvolume-weighted or mass-weighted quantities are measured. We show how these are\nfundamentally related to the fact that mass conservation requires violations of\nlog-normal statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 09:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

The medium, created using\na canonical (fixed isospin charge) approach, induces a reduction of the\nquarkonium energies. As the isospin density increases, the energy shifts first\nincrease and then saturate. The saturation occurs at an isospin density close\nto that where previously a qualitative change in the behaviour of the energy\ndensity of the medium has been observed, which was conjectured to correspond to\na transition from a pion gas to a Bose-Einstein condensed phase. The reduction\nof the quarkonium energies becomes more pronounced as the heavy-quark mass is\ndecreased, similar to the behaviour seen in two-colour QCD at non-zero quark\nchemical potential.

The problem is tackled by integrating the Boussinesq equations\nin a periodic cubical domain using different initial conditions: a non-helical\nTaylor-Green (TG) flow, a fully helical Beltrami (ABC) flow, and random flows\nwith a tunable helicity. We show that for stratified ABC flows helicity\nundergoes a substantially slower decay than for unstratified ABC flows. This\nfact is likely associated to the combined effect of stratification and large\nscale coherent structures. Indeed, when the latter are missing, as in random\nflows, helicity is rapidly destroyed by the onset of gravitational waves. A\ntype of large-scale dissipative \"cyclostrophic\" balance can be invoked to\nexplain this behavior. When helicity survives in the system it strongly affects\nthe temporal energy decay and the energy distribution among Fourier modes. We\ndiscover in fact that the decay rate of energy for stratified helical flows is\nmuch slower than for stratified non-helical flows and can be considered with a\nphenomenological model in a way similar to what is done for unstratified\nrotating flows.

The analysis of these data indicates that the crystalline electric\nfield (CEF) ground state of the trivalent Pr ion is the non-Kramers Gamma3\ndoublet with the quadrupolar degrees of freedom. A sharp peak in the specific\nheat at 0.06 K has been attributed not to the superconducting transition but to\nthe AFQ transition because the ordering temperature TQ decreases in B || [100]\nbut increases in B || [110] and B || [111] with increasing B up to 6 T.

The starting point of this work is the observation\nof a previously unnoticed stability property of the Macdonald superpolynomials\nwhen the fermionic sector m is sufficiently large: their decomposition in the\nmonomial basis is then independent of m. These stable superpolynomials are\nreadily mapped into bisymmetric polynomials, an operation that spoils the ring\nstructure but drastically simplifies the associated vector space. Our main\nresult is a factorization of the (stable) bisymmetric Macdonald polynomials,\ncalled double Macdonald polynomials and indexed by pairs of partitions, into a\nproduct of Macdonald polynomials (albeit subject to non-trivial plethystic\ntransformations). As an off-shoot, we note that, after multiplication by a\nt-Vandermonde determinant, this provides explicit formulas for a large class of\nMacdonald polynomials with prescribed symmetry. The factorization of the double\nMacdonald polynomials leads immediately to the generalization of basically\nevery elementary properties of the Macdonald polynomials to the double case\n(norm, kernel, duality, positivity, etc). When lifted back to superspace, this\nvalidates various previously formulated conjectures in the stable regime.\n  The q,t-Kostka coefficients associated to the double Macdonald polynomials\nare shown to be q,t-analogs of the dimensions of the irreducible\nrepresentations of the hyperoctahedral group B_n. Moreover, a Nabla operator on\nthe double Macdonald polynomials is defined and its action on a certain\nbisymmetric Schur function can be interpreted as the Frobenius series of a\nbigraded module of dimension (2n+1)^n, a formula again characteristic of the\nCoxeter group of type B_n.\n  Finally, as a side result, we obtain a simple identity involving products of\nfour Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 02:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2013 18:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-10"}

Our experiments\nalso show that the surrogate data bootstrapping method tends to give a\nstatistical threshold that are too low for the sparse method.\n  The permutation-test-based method gives a higher (more conservative)\nthreshold and it should be used with the sparse Bayesian method whenever the\ncontrol period is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 06:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-15"}

At each time-step $t$, one of the $k$ site nodes has to pick an\nexpert from the set ${1, ..., n}$, and the same site receives information about\npayoffs of all experts for that round. The goal of the distributed system is to\nminimize regret at time horizon $T$, while simultaneously keeping communication\nto a minimum.\n  The two extreme solutions to this problem are: (i) Full communication: This\nessentially simulates the non-distributed setting to obtain the optimal\n$O(\\sqrt{\\log(n)T})$ regret bound at the cost of $T$ communication. (ii) No\ncommunication: Each site runs an independent copy : the regret is\n$O(\\sqrt{log(n)kT})$ and the communication is 0.

The central\nstrategy presented in this method is to perform transformation on the\nelectronic Hamiltonian for approximate removal of the Coulomb singularity. The\nprinciple difference between the present method and the transcorrelated method\nof Handy and Boys is that the congruent transformation preserves the Hermitian\nproperty of the Hamiltonian. The congruent transformation is carried out using\nexplicitly correlated functions and the optimum correlated transform\nHamiltonian is obtained by performing a search over a set of transformation\nfunctions. The ansatz of the transformation functions are selected to\nfacilitate analytical evaluation of all the resulting integrals. The ground\nstate energy is obtained variationally by performing a full configuration\ninteraction (FCI) calculation on the congruent transformed Hamiltonian.\nComputed results on well-studied benchmark systems show that for the identical\nbasis functions, the energy from the congruent transformed Hamiltonian is\nsignificantly lower than the conventional FCI calculations. Since the number of\nconfiguration state functions in the FCI calculation increases rapidly with the\nsize of the 1-particle basis set, the results indicate that the congruent\ntransformed Hamiltonian provides a viable alternative to obtain FCI quality\nenergy using a smaller underlying 1-particle basis set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 06:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}

Both of these approaches feature\nspin independent elastic scattering of dark matter particles on nuclei. Light\nWIMP dark matter invokes a single particle species which interacts with\nordinary matter via contact interactions. By contrast hidden sector dark matter\nis typically multi-component and is assumed to interact via the exchange of a\nmassless mediator. Such hidden sector dark matter thereby predicts a sharply\nrising nuclear recoil spectrum, $dR/dE_R \\sim 1/E_R^2$ due to this dynamics,\nwhile WIMP dark matter predicts a spectrum which depends sensitively on the\nWIMP mass, $m_\\chi$.

As an example, we\nprovide estimates of the current uncertainties on the position in parameter\nspace of the region which does not break electroweak symmetry in the\nconstrained MSSM (CMSSM). The position of the boundary of EWSB can vary by up\nto 2 TeV in m_0 due to the uncertainties coming from the current measurement\nerrors on the top quark mass and from higher order corrections. In this\ndangerous region, for fixed CMSSM parameters the neutralino lightest\nsupersymmetric particle mass has an associated large uncertainty of order 100%.\nThese uncertainties therefore have a profound effect on the interpretation of\nLHC supersymmetric particle searches in terms of the CMSSM. We also show how to\nameliorate poor convergence of the iterative numerical algorithm that\ncalculates the MSSM spectrum near the boundary of EWSB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 08:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 16:28:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 14:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A popular strategy of localization is to\nuse the measured differences in arrival times of source signals at multiple\npairs of receivers. In the literature, most algorithms that are based on time\ndifferences of arrival (TDOA) assume that the propagation velocity is a\nconstant as a function of the source position, which is valid for air\npropagation or even for narrow band signals. However a bounded medium such as a\nconcrete slab (encountered in indoor environement) is usually dispersive and\ndamped. In this study, we demonstrate that under such conditions, the concrete\nslab can be assimilated to a thin plate; considering a Kelvin-Voigt damping\nmodel, we introduce the notion of {\\em perceived propagation velocity}, which\ndecreases when the source-sensor distance increases. This peculiar behaviour\nprecludes any possibility to rely on existing localization methods in indoor\nenvironment. Therefore, a new localization algorithm that is adapted to a\ndamped and dispersive medium is proposed, using only on the sign of the\nmeasured TDOA (SO-TDOA). A simulation and some experimental results are\nincluded, to define the performance of this SO-TDOA algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 08:21:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 16:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

We\nconduct a systematic parameter study to quantify the dependence of zonal flows\non the background density stratification and the driving of convection.\n  We find that the direction of the equatorial zonal wind is controlled by the\nratio of buoyancy and Coriolis force. The prograde equatorial band maintained\nby Reynolds stresses is found in the rotation-dominated regime. In cases where\nbuoyancy dominates Coriolis force, the angular momentum per unit mass is\nhomogenised and the equatorial band is retrograde, reminiscent to those\nobserved in the ice giants.

This suggests the possibility to test\nfinite temperature local pair correlations for the TLL in the relativistic\ndispersion regime and to probe quantum criticality with the local correlations\nbeyond the TLL phase. Furthermore, thermodynamic properties at high\ntemperatures are obtained by both high temperature and virial expansion of the\nYang-Yang thermodynamic equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 10:47:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 11:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-08"}

Furthermore,\nwe investigate the origin of the discontinuities appeared in the relativistic\nproblems with high viscosities, which were reported in a recent study [D. Hupp\net al., Phys. Rev.

Using a new and powerful application of finite size scaling, we\nfurthermore extend the measurements of the critical couplings to considerably\nlarger values of the lattice sizes, both in the temperature and space\ndirections, than was investigated earlier in this theory. With the help of\nthese measurements we perform a detailed finite size scaling analysis, showing\nthat for the critical exponents of the two dimensional three state Potts model\nthe mass and the susceptibility fall on unique scaling curves. This strongly\nsupports the expectation that the gauge theory is in the same universality\nclass. The Nambu-Goto string model on the other hand predicts that the exponent\n\\nu has the mean field value, which is quite different from the value in the\nabovementioned Potts model. Using our values of the critical couplings we also\ndetermine the continuum limit of the value of the critical temperature in terms\nof the square root of the zero temperature string tension. This value is very\nnear to the prediction of the Nambu-Goto string model in spite of the different\ncritical behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 13:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 17:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

These algorithms depend on numerous parameters, whose\nsettings must be appropriately optimized to offer a seamless connectivity.\nNevertheless, such an optimization is difficult in a time varying context,\nunless adaptive strategies are used. In this paper, a new approach for the\nhandover optimization is proposed. First, a new modeling of the handover\nprocess by a hybrid system that takes as input the handover parameters is\nestablished. Then, this hybrid system is used to pose some dynamical\noptimization approaches where the probability of outage and the probability of\nhandover are considered. Since it is shown that these probabilities are\ndifficult to compute, simple approximations of adequate accuracy are developed.\nBased on these approximations, a new approach to the solution of the handover\noptimizations is proposed by the use of a trellis diagram. A distributed\noptimization algorithm is then developed to maximize handover performance. From\nan extensive set of results obtained by numerical computations and simulations,\nit is shown that the proposed algorithm allows to improve performance of the\nhandover considerably when compared to more traditional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 14:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-15"}

Using inappropriate formulas to model the RM effect\nintroduces biases, at least in the projected velocity Vsin(i) compared to the\nspectroscopic value. Currently, only the iodine cell technique has been\nmodeled, which corresponds to observations done by, e.g., the HIRES\nspectrograph of the Keck telescope. In this paper, we provide a simple\nexpression of the RM effect specially designed to model observations done by\nthe Gaussian fit of a cross-correlation function (CCF) as in the routines\nperformed by the HARPS team. We derived also a new analytical formulation of\nthe RV anomaly associated to the iodine cell technique.

We compare our\nformulas adapted to the CCF technique with simulated data generated with the\nnumerical software SOAP-T and find good agreement up to Vsin(i) < 20 km/s.

Such a framework builds upon\nblock-Markov encoding with interference quantization, optimally combining the\nuse of both outdated and instantaneous CSIT. A striking feature of our work is\nthat, by varying the power allocation, every point in the DoF region can be\nachieved with one single scheme. As a result, instead of checking the\nachievability of every corner point of the outer bound region, as typically\ndone in the literature, we propose a new systematic way to prove the\nachievability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 14:54:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2013 14:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

For these reasons, a more thorough\nand complete understanding of network sampling is critical to support the field\nof network science. In this paper, we outline a framework for the general\nproblem of network sampling, by highlighting the different objectives,\npopulation and units of interest, and classes of network sampling methods. In\naddition, we propose a spectrum of computational models for network sampling\nmethods, ranging from the traditionally studied model based on the assumption\nof a static domain to a more challenging model that is appropriate for\nstreaming domains. We design a family of sampling methods based on the concept\nof graph induction that generalize across the full spectrum of computational\nmodels (from static to streaming) while efficiently preserving many of the\ntopological properties of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how\ntraditional static sampling algorithms can be modified for graph streams for\neach of the three main classes of sampling methods: node, edge, and\ntopology-based sampling. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed\nfamily of sampling methods more accurately preserves the underlying properties\nof the graph for both static and streaming graphs. Finally, we study the impact\nof network sampling algorithms on the parameter estimation and performance\nevaluation of relational classification algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 01:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}

In particular, we focus on two\ndifferent strategies by which the ternary electrolytes can be devised, namely\nby (a) adding the ionic liquid to PEO20LiTFSI, and (b) substituting the PEO\nchains in PEO20LiTFSI by the ionic liquid. In order to grasp the changes of the\noverall lithium transport mechanism, we employ an analytical, Rouse-based\ncation transport model (Maitra et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2007, 98, 227802),\nwhich has originally been devised for binary PEO-based electrolytes. This model\ndistinguishes three different microscopic transport mechanisms, each quantified\nby an individual time scale. In the course of our analysis, we extend this\nmathematical description to account for an entirely new transport mechanism,\nnamely the TFSI-supported diffusion of lithium ions decoupled from the PEO\nchains, which emerges for certain stoichiometries. We find that the segmental\nmobility plays a decisive role in PEO-based polymer electrolytes. That is,\nwhereas the addition of the ionic liquid to PEO20LiTFSI plasticizes the polymer\nnetwork and thus also increases the lithium diffusion, the amount of free,\nmobile ether oxygens reduces when substituting the PEO chains by the ionic\nliquid, which compensates the plasticizing effect. In total, our observations\nallow us to formulate some general principles about the lithium ion transport\nmechanism in ternary polymer electrolytes. Moreover, our insights also shed\nlight on recent experimental observations (Joost et al., Electrochim. Acta,\n2012, 86, 330).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 14:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 13:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 21:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-03"}

But the method may be inapplicable or inefficient\nin some portions of the computational domain, e.g., near the domain boundary or\nnear long narrow channels inside the domain due to the lack of permeability\ninformation outside of the domain or the fact that the high-conductivity\nfeatures cannot be localized within a coarse-grid block. In this paper we\ndevelop a combined finite element and multiscale finite element method\n(FE-MsFEM), which deals with such portions by using the standard finite element\nmethod on a fine mesh and the other portions by the oversampling MsFEM. The\ntransmission conditions across the FE-MSFE interface is treated by the penalty\ntechnique. A rigorous convergence analysis for this special FE-MsFEM is given\nunder the assumption that the diffusion coefficient is periodic. Numerical\nexperiments are carried out for the elliptic equations with periodic and random\nhighly oscillating coefficients, as well as multiscale problems with high\ncontrast channels, to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 23:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}
