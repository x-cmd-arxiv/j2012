They can\nbe utilized as measurement devices of individual persons and for groups of\npeople of the social context and the related interactions. The picture of human\nlife that emerges shows complexity, which is manifested in such data in\nproperties of the spatiotemporal tracks of individuals. We extract from\nsmartphone-based data for a set of persons important locations such as \"home\",\n\"work\" and so forth over fixed length time-slots covering the days in the\ndata-set. This set of typical places is heavy-tailed, a power-law distribution\nwith an exponent close to -1.7. To analyze the regularities and stochastic\nfeatures present, the days are classified for each person into regular,\npersonal patterns. To this are superimposed fluctuations for each day. This\nrandomness is measured by \"life\" entropy, computed both before and after\nfinding the clustering so as to subtract the contribution of a number of\npatterns. The main issue, that we then address, is how predictable individuals\nare in their mobility. The patterns and entropy are reflected in the\npredictability of the mobility of the life both individually and on average. We\nexplore the simple approaches to guess the location from the typical behavior,\nand of exploiting the transition probabilities with time from location or\nactivity A to B. The patterns allow an enhanced predictability, at least up to\na few hours into the future from the current location. Such fixed habits are\nmost clearly visible in the working-day length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 16:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking accompanied by the formation of lower-dimensional topological\ndefects, e.g. cosmic strings, is triggered by the so-called `tachyon\ncondensation', where the existence of tachyons is attributable to the\ninstability of the brane-anti-brane system. Here, we discuss the closest\nanalogue of the tachyon condensation in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. We\nconsider annihilation of domain walls, namely branes, in strongly segregated\ntwo-component condensates, where one component is sandwiched by two domains of\nthe other component. In this system, the process of the brane annihilation can\nbe projected effectively as ferromagnetic ordering dynamics onto a\ntwo-dimensional space. Based on this correspondence, three-dimensional\nformation of vortices from a domain-wall annihilation is considered to be a\nkink formation due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the two-dimensional\nspace. We also discuss a mechanism to create a `vorton' when the sandwiched\ncomponent has a vortex string bridged between the branes.

Hess, Nobel Lecture,\nDecember 12, 1936\n  High-energy radiation bursts are commonplace in our Universe. From nearby\nsolar flares to distant gamma ray bursts, a variety of physical processes\naccelerate charged particles to a wide range of energies, which subsequently\nreach the Earth. Such particles contribute to a number of physical processes\noccurring in the Earth system. A large fraction of the energy of charged\nparticles gets deposited in the atmosphere, ionizing the atmosphere, causing\nchanges in its chemistry and affecting the global electric circuit. Remaining\nsecondary particles contribute to the background dose of cosmic rays on the\nsurface and parts of the subsurface region. Life has evolved over the past ~ 3\nbillion years in presence of this background radiation, which itself has varied\nconsiderably during the period. As demonstrated by the Miller-Urey experiment,\nlightning plays a very important role in the formation of complex organic\nmolecules, which are the building blocks of more complex structures forming\nlife. There is growing evidence of increase in the lightning rate with\nincreasing flux of charged particles. Is there a connection between enhanced\nrate of cosmic rays and the origin of life? Cosmic ray secondaries are also\nknown to damage DNA and cause mutations, leading to cancer and other diseases.\nIt is now possible to compute radiation doses from secondary particles, in\nparticular muons and neutrons. Have the variations in cosmic ray flux affected\nthe evolution of life on earth? We describe the mechanisms of cosmic rays\naffecting terrestrial life and review the potential implications of the\nvariation of high-energy astrophysical radiation on the history of life on\nearth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 17:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 01:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 03:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

However, when we fix these quantities\nand morphology, we still find large dispersions in the galaxy size\ndistribution. We investigate the origin of these dispersions for red early-type\ngalaxies, using two SDSS-based catalogs. We find that the sizes of faint\ngalaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) < 10.3 or M_r > -19.5, where M_r is the r-band\nabsolute magnitude, k-corrected to z = 0.1) are affected more significantly by\nluminosity, while the sizes of bright galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) > 11.4 or M_r\n< -21.4) are by dynamical mass. At fixed mass and luminosity, the sizes of\nlow-mass galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10.45 and M_r ~ -19.8) are relatively\nless sensitive to their colors, color gradients and axis ratios. On the other\nhand, the sizes of intermediate-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10.85 and M_r ~ -20.4)\nand high-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 11.25 and M_r ~ -21.0) galaxies significantly\ndepend on those parameters, in the sense that larger red early-type galaxies\nhave bluer colors, more negative color gradients (bluer outskirts) and smaller\naxis ratios. These results indicate that the sizes of intermediate- and\nhigh-mass red early-type galaxies are significantly affected by their recent\nminor mergers or rotations, whereas the sizes of low-mass red early-type\ngalaxies are affected by some other mechanisms.

We\ncompare differences in the log of black hole masses estimated from different\nemission lines and show that they depend on radio core dominance in the sense\nthat core-dominated, jet-on objects have systematically smaller H-beta and Mg\nII determined masses compared to those from C IV, while lobe-dominated edge-on\nobjects have systematically larger H-beta and Mg II determined masses compared\nto those from C IV.

The model\nconsiders that the flow is ballistic, and gives fully analytical expressions\nfor both the accretion rate onto the point mass, and the gravitational drag it\nsuffers.

However, life-history models predict that males\nbenefit from increasing sexual investment approaching old age, producing\nage-dependent sexual traits. Age-dependent traits require time and energy to\ngrow, and will not fully mature before individuals enter mating competition.\nEarly evolutionary stages pose several problems for these traits. Age-dependent\ntraits suffer from strong viability selection and gain little benefit from mate\nchoice when rare. Few males will grow large traits, and they will rarely\nencounter choosy females. The evolutionary origins of age-dependent traits\ntherefore remain unclear. I used numerical simulations to analyze evolution of\npreferences, condition (viability) and traits in an age-structured population.\nTraits in the model depended on age and condition (\"good genes\") in a\npopulation with no genetic drift. I asked (1) if age-dependent indicator traits\nand their preferences can originate depending on the strength of selection and\nthe size of the trait; (2) which mode of development (age-dependent versus\nage-independent) eventually predominates when both modes occur in the\npopulation; and (3) if age-independent traits can invade a population with\nage-dependent traits. Age-dependent traits evolve under weaker selection and at\nsmaller sizes than age-independent traits. Evolution of age-independent traits\ndepends only on trait size, whereas evolution of age-dependent traits depends\non both strength of selection and growth rate. Invasion of age-independence\ninto populations with established traits followed a similar pattern with\nage-dependence predominating at small trait sizes. I suggest that reduced adult\nmortality facilitates sexual selection by favoring the evolution of\nage-dependent sexual signals under weak selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 19:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 20:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 19:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2013 20:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-16"}

Having a\nmoderate Jeans parameter Pluto's atmosphere does not fit the classic definition\nof Jeans escape for light species escaping from the terrestrial planets, nor\ndoes it fit the hydrodynamic outflow from comets and certain exoplanets. It has\nbeen proposed for some time that Pluto lies in the region of slow hydrodynamic\nescape. Using a hybrid fluid/molecular-kinetic model, we previously\ndemonstrated the typical implementation of this model fails to correctly\ndescribe the appropriate temperature structure for the upper atmosphere for\nsolar minimum conditions. Here we use a time-dependent solver to allow us to\nextend those simulations to higher heating rates and we examine fluid models in\nwhich Jeans-like escape expressions are used for the upper boundary conditions.\nWe compare these to hybrid simulations of the atmosphere under heating\nconditions roughly representative of solar minimum and mean conditions as these\nbracket conditions expected during the New Horizon encounter. Although we find\nescape rates comparable to those previously estimated by the slow hydrodynamic\nescape model, and roughly consistent with energy limited escape, our model\nproduces a much more extended atmosphere with higher temperatures roughly\nconsistent with recent observations of CO. Such an extended atmosphere will be\naffected by Charon and will affect Pluto's interaction with the solar wind at\nthe New Horizon encounter. Since we have previously shown that such models can\nbe scaled, these results have implications for modeling exoplanet atmospheres\nfor which the energy limited escape approximation is often used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 19:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2013 23:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

With 1 TeV energy and polarized beams, the\nreach can be extended to 3-4 TeV. The ILC can discover this signature even if\nannihilation to electrons provides only a small fraction of the total dark\nmatter annihilation rate in the early universe. We also argue that large\nregions of parameter space allowed by current LHC and direct detection bounds\nwill be accessible at the ILC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 20:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We distinguish two models. For the first one, we do not take into\naccount the influence of Intra-Group Matter (IGrM). In this case we demonstrate\nthat for currently known parameters of this system the collision is hardly\nplausible because of the angular momentum. These galaxies will approach the\nminimum distance of about 290 Kpc in 4.44 Gyr from present and then begin to\nrun away irreversibly from each other.

Therefore, for the IGrM particles with masses\nless than 17 MeV the merger becomes problematic.

For\nsuch processes the zero-acceleration surface (where gravitational attraction is\nbalanced by cosmological accelerated expansion) plays the crucial role.

Unlike in previous analysis\nof perturbed 2d cluster states, we find strong evidence of a very well defined\ncluster phase, separated from a polarized phase by a line of 1st and 2nd order\ntransitions compatible with the 3d Ising universality class and a tricritical\nend point. The phase boundary sets an upper bound for the amount of\nperturbation in the system so that its ground state is still useful for\nmeasurement-based quantum computation purposes. Moreover, we also compute the\nlocal fidelity with the unperturbed 2d cluster state. Besides a classical\napproximation, we determine the phase diagram by combining series expansions\nand variational infinite Projected entangled-Pair States (iPEPS) methods. Our\nwork constitutes the first analysis of the non-trivial effect of few-body\nperturbations in the 2d cluster state, which is of relevance for experimental\nproposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 22:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 07:24:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 14:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-13"}

This results in codes that have additional structure. Searching for\ncodes in constant Hamming weight induced subgraphs is computationally easier\nthan searching the original graph. We prove a lower bound on size of a codebook\nconstructed this way for any number of deletions and show that it is only a\nsmall factor below the corresponding lower bound on unrestricted codes. In the\nsingle deletion case, we find optimal colorings of the constant Hamming weight\ninduced subgraphs.

One possible explanation is the increased difficulty of detecting\nthese haloes if most of the visible matter is lost at early evolutionary phases\nthrough galactic winds. In this work we study the current models of triggering\ngalactic winds in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) from supernovae, and study,\nbased on 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations, the correlation of the mass\nloss rates and important physical parameters as the dark matter halo mass and\nits radial profile, and the star formation rate. We find that the existence of\nwinds is ubiquitous, independent on the gravitational potential. Our\nsimulations revealed that the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) may play a\nmajor role on pushing matter out of these systems, even for very massive\nhaloes. The instability is responsible for 5 - 40% of the mass loss during the\nearly evolution of the galaxy, being less relevant at $t > 200$Myrs. There is\nno significant difference in the mass loss rates obtained for the different\ndark matter profiles studied (NFW and logarithmic). We have also found a\ncorrelation between the mass loss rate and both the halo mass and the rate of\nsupernovae, as already reported in previous works. Besides, the epoch in which\nmost of the baryon galactic matter is removed from the galaxy varies depending\non the SN rate and gravitational potential. The later, combined to the\nimportance of the RTI in each model, may change our understanding about the\nchemical evolution of dwarf galaxies, as well as in the heavy element\ncontamination of the intergalactic medium at high redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2012 00:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

By describing\nparticles as points, EFT avoids computing functional integrals subject to\ndifficult constraints. Still, all information pertaining to particle size and\nshape is systematically restored by amending the surface Hamiltonian with a\nderivative expansion. The free energy is obtained as a cumulant expansion, for\nwhich straightforward techniques exist. We derive a complete description for\nrigid axisymmetric objects, which allows us to develop a full asymptotic\nexpansion in powers of the inverse distance for the pair interaction. We also\ndemonstrate by a few examples the efficiency with which multibody interactions\ncan be computed. Moreover, although the main advantage of the EFT approach lies\nin explicit computation, we discuss how one can infer certain features of cases\ninvolving flexible or anisotropic objects. The EFT description also permits a\nsystematic computation of ground-state surface-mediated interactions, which we\nillustrate with a few examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2012 04:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Seven of the systems are of large size\nratio, i.e. they consist of a larger primary and two moonlets, while the other\ntwo systems have components of comparable size. Each case is treated\nseparately. For the triple minor planets that have large size ratio, the\nsufficient condition for Hill stability is expressed in closed form.

We propose the new theory of nonlinear dynamic volatilities and the\nnew nonlinear dynamic chaos (NDC) volatility model for the statistical modeling\nof financial volatility with the aim to determine the Value at Risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2012 10:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

However, owing to the peak constraint, clustering\nstatistics of discrete density peaks are difficult to evaluate. For this\nreason, local bias schemes have received considerably more attention in the\nliterature thus far. In this paper, we show that the 2-point correlation\nfunction of maxima of a homogeneous and isotropic Gaussian random field can be\nthought of, up to second order at least, as arising from a local bias expansion\nformulated in terms of rotationally invariant variables. This expansion relies\non a unique smoothing scale, which is the Lagrangian radius of dark matter\nhalos. The great advantage of this local bias approach is that it circumvents\nthe difficult computation of joint probability distributions. We demonstrate\nthat the bias factors associated with these rotational invariants can be\ncomputed using a peak-background split argument, in which the background\nperturbation shifts the corresponding probability distribution functions.\nConsequently, the bias factors are orthogonal polynomials averaged over those\nspatial locations that satisfy the peak constraint. In particular, asphericity\nin the peak profile contributes to the clustering at quadratic and higher\norder, with bias factors given by generalized Laguerre polynomials.

A\nsimplified model is presented for how helicity is injected and transported in\nthe closed corona by magnetic reconnection. With this model we demonstrate that\nhelicity must condense onto PILs and coronal hole boundaries, and estimate the\nrate of helicity accumulation at PILs and the loss to the wind.

In\nparticular, this congruence arises a conjecture for a prime to be Wolstenholme\nprime. We also propose several Giuga-Agoh's-like conjectures. Further, we\nestablish two congruences modulo $n^3$ for two binomial type sums involving\nsums of powers $S_{2i}(n)$ with $i=0,1,...,k$. Furthermore, using the above\ncongruence reduced modulo $n^2$, we obtain an extension of Carlitz-von Staudt\nresult for odd power sums.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2012 13:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-12"}
