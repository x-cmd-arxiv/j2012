We use a\ncortical circuit model of neural networks composed of irregular spiking\nexcitatory and inhibitory neurons having type 1 and 2 excitability and\nstochastic dynamics. In the model, neurons form a sparsely connected network\nand their spontaneous activity is driven by random spikes representing synaptic\nnoise. Using simulations and analytical calculations, we found that if the STSD\nis absent, the neural network shows either asynchronous behavior or regular\nnetwork oscillations depending on the noise level. In networks with STSD,\nchanging parameters of synaptic plasticity and the noise level, we observed\ntransitions to complex patters of collective activity: mixed-mode and spindle\noscillations, bursts of collective activity, and chaotic behaviour.\nInterestingly, these patterns are stable in a certain range of the parameters\nand separated by critical boundaries. Thus, the parameters of synaptic\nplasticity can play a role of control parameters or switchers between different\nnetwork states. However, changes of the parameters caused by a disease may lead\nto dramatic impairment of ongoing neural activity.

We find non-zero\nclosure phases, indicating a significant flux asymmetry in the K-band emission\n(e.g., a departure from a single point source detection). We also present\nradiative transfer modeling of the SED of the FL Cha system and find that the\ngap extends from ~0.06 to ~8.3 AU. We demonstrate that the non-zero closure\nphases can be explained almost equally well by starlight scattered off the\ninner edge of the outer disk or by a (sub)stellar companion. Single-epoch,\nsingle-wavelength SAM observations of transitional disks with large cavities\nthat could become resolved should thus be interpreted with caution, taking the\ndisk and its properties into consideration. In the context of a binary model,\nthe signal is most consistent with a high-contrast (delta_K ~4.8 mag) source at\na ~40 mas (6 AU) projected separation. However, the flux ratio and separation\nparameters remain highly degenerate and a much brighter source (deta_K ~1 mag)\nat 15 mas (2.4 AU) can also reproduce the signal. Second-epoch,\nmulti-wavelength observations are needed to establish the nature of the SAM\ndetection in FL Cha.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 03:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In particular, we have analyzed the site-specific\nrate variation across the two primary structural partitions, transmembrane (TM)\nand extramembrane (EM), of these membrane proteins. We find that transmembrane\ndomains evolve more slowly than do extramembrane domains, though TM domains\ndisplay increased rate heterogeneity relative to their EM counterparts.\nAlthough the majority of residues across GPCRs experience strong to weak\npurifying selection, many GPCRs experience positive selection at both TM and EM\nresidues, albeit with a slight bias towards the EM. Further, a subset of GPCRs,\nchemosensory receptors (including olfactory and taste receptors), exhibit\nincreased rates of evolution relative to other GPCRs, an effect which is more\npronounced in their TM spans. Although it has been previously suggested that\nthe TM's low evolutionary rate is caused by their high percentage of buried\nresidues, we show that their attenuated rate seems to stem from the strong\nbiophysical constraints of the membrane itself, or by functional requirements.\nIn spite of the strong evolutionary constraints acting on the transmembrane\nspans of GPCRs, positive selection and high levels of evolutionary rate\nvariability are common.

We mainly focus on quantitative evaluation approaches\nand, in particular, on model-based evaluation techniques that are commonly used\nto evaluate and compare, from the dependability point of view, different\narchitecture alternatives at the design stage. We outline some of the main\nmodeling techniques aiming at mastering the largeness of analytical\ndependability models at the construction level. Actually, addressing the model\nlargeness problem is important with respect to the investigation of the\nscalability of current techniques to meet the complexity challenges of\nubiquitous systems. Finally we present two case studies in which some of the\npresented techniques are applied for modeling web services and General Packet\nRadio Service (GPRS) mobile telephone networks, as prominent examples of large\nand evolving systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 07:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

The main\nchallenge is avoiding deadlock anomalies while keeping limitations on message\ninjection and forwarding minimal. Current approaches, whose complexity is so\nhigh that their practical applicability is limited, either require the\nexistence of extra network resources like virtual channels, or they affect the\nperformance of the network during the reconfiguration process. In this paper we\npresent a simple, fast and efficient mechanism for dynamic network\nreconfiguration which is based on regressive deadlock recoveries instead of\navoiding deadlocks. The mechanism which is referred to as DBR guarantees a\ndeadlock-free reconfiguration based on wormhole switching (WS) and it does not\nrequire additional resources. In this approach, the need for a reliable message\ntransmission has led to a modified WS mechanism which includes additional flits\nor control signals. DBR allows cycles to be formed and in such conditions when\na deadlock occurs, the messages suffer from time-out. Then, this method\nreleases the buffers and channels from the current node and thus the source\nretransmits the message after a random time gap. Evaluating results reveal that\nthe mechanism shows substantial performance improvements over the other methods\nand it works efficiently in different topologies with various routing\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 09:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

LP\ndecoding has been derived for binary and nonbinary linear codes. However, the\nmost important problem with LP decoding for both binary and nonbinary linear\ncodes is that the complexity of standard LP solvers such as the simplex\nalgorithm remains prohibitively large for codes of moderate to large block\nlength. To address this problem, two low-complexity LP (LCLP) decoding\nalgorithms for binary linear codes have been proposed by Vontobel and Koetter,\nhenceforth called the basic LCLP decoding algorithm and the subgradient LCLP\ndecoding algorithm.\n  In this paper, we generalize these LCLP decoding algorithms to nonbinary\nlinear codes. The computational complexity per iteration of the proposed\nnonbinary LCLP decoding algorithms scales linearly with the block length of the\ncode. A modified BCJR algorithm for efficient check-node calculations in the\nnonbinary basic LCLP decoding algorithm is also proposed, which has complexity\nlinear in the check node degree.\n  Several simulation results are presented for nonbinary LDPC codes defined\nover Z_4, GF(4), and GF(8) using quaternary phase-shift keying and\n8-phase-shift keying, respectively, over the AWGN channel. It is shown that for\nsome group-structured LDPC codes, the error-correcting performance of the\nnonbinary LCLP decoding algorithms is similar to or better than that of the\nmin-sum decoding algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 11:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 00:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In\ncontrast to previous works, the calibration experiment quality is evaluated\nusing a concept of the user-defined test-pose. In the frame of this concept,\nthe related optimization problem is formulated and numerical routines are\ndeveloped, which allow user to generate optimal set of manipulator\nconfigurations for a given number of calibration experiments. The efficiency of\nthe developed technique is illustrated by several examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 08:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-29"}

By this definition, turbulence always cascades from\nsmall scales where vorticity is created to larger scales where turbulence\nfossilizes. Fossil turbulence is any perturbation in a hydrophysical field\nproduced by turbulence that persists after the fluid is no longer turbulent at\nthe scale of the perturbation. Fossil turbulence patterns and fossil turbulence\nwaves preserve and propagate energy and information about previous turbulence.\nIgnorance of fossil turbulence properties can be dangerous. Examples include\nthe Osama bin Laden helicopter crash and the Air France 447 Airbus crash, both\nunfairly blamed on the pilots. Observations support the proposed definitions,\nand suggest even direct numerical simulations of turbulence require caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 00:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}
