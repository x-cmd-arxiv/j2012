The present paper aims to clarify the situation. A known\nalgorithm for calculation of the reflection coefficient $R_{\\epsilon j}$ on the\nbackground of the de Sitter space-time model is analyzed. It is shown that the\ndetermination of $R_{\\epsilon j}$ requires an additional constrain on quantum\nnumbers $\\epsilon R / \\hbar c >> j$, where $R$ is a curvature radius. When\ntaking into account this condition, the value of $R_{\\epsilon j}$ turns out to\nbe precisely zero. It is shown that the basic instructive definition for the\ncalculation of the reflection coefficient in de Sitter model is grounded\nexclusively on the use of zero order approximation in the expansion of a\nparticle wave function in a series on small parameter $1/R^{2}$, and it\ndemonstrated that this recipe cannot be extended on accounting for\ncontributions of higher order terms. So the result $R_{\\epsilon j}=0$ which has\nbeen obtained from examining zero-order term persists and cannot be improved.\nIt is claimed that the alculation of the reflection coefficient $R_{\\epsilon\nj}$ is not required at all because there is no barrier in the effective\npotential curve on the background of the de Sitter space-time, the later\ncorrelate with the fact that the problem in de Sitter space reduces to a second\norder differential equation with only three singular points. However all known\nquantum mechanical problems with potentials containing one barrier reduce to a\nsecond order differential equation with four singular points, the equation of\nHeun class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2012 16:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

RSA is\nfrequently used to describe a protein's biophysical or evolutionary properties.\nTo calculate RSA, a residue's solvent accessibility (ASA) needs to be\nnormalized by a suitable reference value for the given amino acid; several\nnormalization scales have previously been proposed. However, these scales do\nnot provide tight upper bounds on ASA values frequently observed in empirical\ncrystal structures. Instead, they underestimate the largest allowed ASA values,\nby up to 20%. As a result, many empirical crystal structures contain residues\nthat seem to have RSA values in excess of one. Here, we derive a new\nnormalization scale that does provide a tight upper bound on observed ASA\nvalues. We pursue two complementary strategies, one based on extensive analysis\nof empirical structures and one based on systematic enumeration of\nbiophysically allowed tripeptides. Both approaches yield congruent results that\nconsistently exceed published values. We conclude that previously published ASA\nnormalization values were too small, primarily because the conformations that\nmaximize ASA had not been correctly identified.

We then study how the shape of this probability\ndistribution depends on the timescales for the existence of observers, for\nvacuum domination, and for curvature domination ($t_{obs}, t_{\\Lambda},$ and\n$t_c$, respectively.) In this work we restrict ourselves to bubbles with\npositive cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$.

A long timeline kinematic study of the archetypal CSO OQ 208 sheds\nlight on the physical properties of the most compact radio sources.\n  Methods. Archival data from the VLBA at 15 GHz over a time span of 13.6 yr\nare used to investigate the kinematics of the radio source. The flux density\nmonitoring data obtained at the Michigan 26-meter radio telescope are also used\nas supplementary information.\n  Results. At 8.4 and 15 GHz, the two lobes are resolved into two\nsub-components, identified as hotspots. A knotty jet is linked with the NE\nhotspot and traces back toward the geometric center. The core is too weak to be\ndetected. Significant flux density variation is found in the primary hotspots\nwith the maximum level of 62% (NE1) and 19% (SW1). The peak in the flux density\nof NE1 leads that of SW1 by approximately 5.00 yr, suggesting that the\nnortheast lobe is advancing and the southwest lobe is receding. This light\ntravel difference indicates a radial distance difference between the two\nhotspots of 1.53 pc, which indicates an inclination angle of about 80.8 degree\nbetween the radio jet and the line of sight. The angular separation rate\nbetween NE1 and SW1 is 0.027 mas/yr (or 0.133 c). The inner jet knot moves at\n0.047 mas/yr (or 0.230 c), about 3.5 times the hotspot advancing speed.\n  Conclusions. The large viewing angle and the modest jet speed suggest a\nmildly relativistic jet. The jet axis is close to the plane of the sky. The\nseparation rate and the distance between the two primary hotspots result in a\nkinematic age of 255$\\pm$17 yr, confirming that OQ 208 is indeed a young radio\nsource.

In contrast, the semi-analytical models of De Lucia & Blazoit 2007\n(DLB07) and Guo et al. 2011 (Guo11), built on the same dark matter halo merger\ntrees than the empirical model, still have difficulties in reproducing these\nobservational data simultaneously. We compare the relations between the stellar\nmass of galaxies and their host halo mass in the three models, and find that\nthey are different. When the relations are rescaled to have the same median\nvalues and the same scatter as in Wang et al., the rescaled DLB07 model can fit\nboth the measured galaxy stellar mass function and the correlation function\nmeasured in different galaxy stellar mass bins. In contrast, the rescaled Guo11\nmodel still over-predicts the clustering of low-mass galaxies. This indicates\nthat the detail of how galaxies populate the scatter in the stellar mass --\nhalo mass relation does play an important role in determining the correlation\nfunctions of galaxies. While the stellar mass of galaxies in the Wang et al.\nmodel depends only on halo mass and is randomly distributed within the scatter,\ngalaxy stellar mass depends also on the halo formation time in semi-analytical\nmodels. At fixed value of infall mass, galaxies that lie above the median\nstellar mass -- halo mass relation reside in haloes that formed earlier, while\ngalaxies that lie below the median relation reside in haloes that formed later.\nThis effect is much stronger in Guo11 than in DLB07, which explains the\nover-clustering of low mass galaxies in Guo11.

This polynomial may be defined on any\nperiodic two-dimensional lattice. It depends on a finite subgraph B, called the\nbasis, and the manner in which B is tiled to construct the lattice. The real\nroots v = e^K - 1 of P_B(q,v) either give the exact critical points for the\nlattice, or provide approximations that, in principle, can be made arbitrarily\naccurate by increasing the size of B in an appropriate way. In earlier work,\nP_B(q,v) was defined by a contraction-deletion identity, similar to that\nsatisfied by the Tutte polynomial. Here, we give a probabilistic definition of\nP_B(q,v), which facilitates its computation, using the transfer matrix, on much\nlarger B than was previously possible. We present results for the critical\npolynomial on the (4,8^2), kagome, and (3,12^2) lattices for bases of up to\nrespectively 96, 162, and 243 edges, compared to the limit of 36 edges with\ncontraction-deletion. We discuss in detail the role of the symmetries and the\nembedding of B.

The IR to UV\nluminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the UV luminosity range we\nexplore. We also find that the IR to UV luminosity ratio is correlated with\nbeta. We observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived from\nlow-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlation\nderived from local normal star-forming galaxies. Using these results we\nreconstruct the IR luminosity function of our UV-selected sample. This\nluminosity function recovers the IR luminosity functions measured from IR\nselected samples at the faintest luminosities (Lir ~ 10^{11} L_sun), but might\nunderestimate them at the bright-end (Lir > 5.10^{11} L_sun).

In correlated systems, it is interesting to compare this experimental\nvalue to that obtained in band structure calculations, as deviations are\nusually taken as a good indicator of the presence of strong electronic\ncorrelations. Nevertheless, it is not always straightforward to extract vF from\nARPES spectra. We study here the case of layered cobaltates, an interesting\nfamily of correlated metals. We compare the results obtained by standard\nmethods, namely the fit of spectra at constant momentum k (energy distribution\ncurve, EDC) or constant binding energy omega(momentum distribution curve, MDC).\nWe find that the difference of vF between the two methods can be as large as a\nfactor 2. The reliability of the 2 methods is intimately linked to the degree\nof k- and omega-dependence of the electronic self-energy. As the k-dependence\nis usually much smaller than the omega dependence for a correlated system, the\nMDC analysis is generally expected to give more reliable results. However, we\nreview here several examples within cobaltates, where the MDC analysis\napparently leads to unphysical results, while the EDC analysis appears\ncoherent. We attribute the difference between the EDC and MDC analysis to a\nstrong variation of the photoemission intensity with the momentum k. This\ndistorts the MDC lineshapes but does not affect the EDC ones. Simulations\nincluding a k dependence of the intensity allow to reproduce the difference\nbetween MDC and EDC analysis very well. This momentum dependence could be of\nextrinsic or intrinsic. We argue that the latter is the most likely and\nactually contains valuable information on the nature of the correlations that\nwould be interesting to extract further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 09:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

The flow is inferred from the\ndetection of a residual dipole generated by CMB fluctuations exclusively in the\ndirection of galaxy clusters, and measured within apertures containing zero\nmonopole. Consistent with this interpretation, the amplitude of the dipole\ncorrelates with the X-ray luminosity of the clusters. To enable this\nmeasurement, the CMB data need to be filtered to remove the primary CMB,\nthereby increasing the data's signal-to-noise ratio. Filtering cannot imprint a\nsignal with the mentioned properties at cluster positions; however, an\ninadequately designed filter can greatly suppress such a signal. We show here\nthat recent studies that failed to detect a large-scale flow with various\nfilters indeed adopted flawed implementations; when correctly implemented,\nthese alternative filters lead to results that are in fact consistent with the\nDark Flow signal. The discrepancies can be traced to the likely presence of\nresidual dipoles caused by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, to\nassumptions about cluster profiles incompatible with the data as well as\nfailure to compute dipoles at the zero monopole aperture.

The amount of CO2 in\ntheir atmosphere is of great importance for surface conditions and\nhabitability. In the absence of detailed information on the geochemistry of the\nplanet, this amount could be considered as a free parameter. Up to now, CO2\npartial pressures for terrestrial planets have been obtained assuming an\navailable volatile reservoir and outgassing scenarios. This study aims at\ncalculating the allowed maximum CO2 pressure at the surface of terrestrial\nexoplanets orbiting near the outer boundary of the habitable zone by coupling\nthe radiative effects of the CO2 and its condensation at the surface. These\nconstraints might limit the permitted amount of atmospheric CO2, independent of\nthe planetary reservoir. A 1D radiative-convective cloud-free atmospheric model\nwas used. CO2 partial pressures are fixed according to surface temperature and\nvapor pressure curve. Considered scenarios cover a wide range of parameters.\nResults show that for planets in the habitable zone around K-, G-, and F-type\nstars the allowed CO2 pressure is limited by the vapor pressure curve and not\nby the planetary reservoir. The maximum CO2 pressure lies below the CO2 vapor\npressure at the critical point of pcrit =73.8 bar. For M-type stars, CO2\npressures above pcrit are possible for almost all scenarios considered across\nthe habitable zone. This implies that determining CO2 partial pressures for\nterrestrial planets by using only geological models is probably too simplified\nand might over-estimate atmospheric CO2 towards the outer edge of the habitable\nzone.

The results show that the\nexistence of this narrow $D_{03}$ state is also compatible with current\n$\\Lambda$ polarization data and that the more accurate $\\Lambda$ polarization\ndata at $P_{K^-}=735$MeV can offer further evidence for the existence of this\nresonance. Furthermore, the role of the $\\Lambda(1690)$ resonance in this\nreaction is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 11:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

Numerical results show that dense Wi-Fi is the cheapest solution at\na relatively low demand level.

J. Phys.\nChem. B 116 (2012) 7449]. We reduce the problem to a model BChl dimer to\nelucidate the role of resonance coupling, site energies, nuclear mode and\nenergy disorder in the enhancement of vibronic-exciton and ground-state\nvibrational coherences, and to identify regimes where this enhancement is\nsignificant. For a heterodimer representing the two coupled BChls 3 and 4 of\nthe FMO complex, the initial amplitude of the vibronic-exciton and vibrational\ncoherences are enhanced by up to 15 and 5 times, respectively, compared to the\nvibrational coherences in the isolated monomer. This maximum initial amplitude\nenhancement occurs when there is a resonance between the electronic energy gap\nand the frequency of the vibrational mode. The bandwidth of this enhancement is\nabout 100 cm-1 for both mechanisms. The excitonic mixing of electronic and\nvibrational DOF leads to additional dephasing relative to the vibrational\ncoherences. We evaluate the dephasing dynamics by solving the quantum master\nequation in Markovian approximation and observe a strong dependence of the\nlife-time enhancement on the mode frequency. Long-lived vibronic-exciton\ncoherences are found to be generated only when the frequency of the mode is in\nthe vicinity of the electronic resonance. Although the vibronic-exciton\ncoherences exhibit a larger initial amplitude compared to the ground-state\nvibrational coherences, we conclude that both type have a similar magnitude at\nlong time for the present model. The ability to distinguish between\nvibronic-exciton and ground-state vibrational coherences in the general case of\nmolecular aggregate is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 13:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

A simple one-dimensional discrete-time model is used to analyze\nthe boost or buck converter in discontinuous conduction mode. Seven different\ncontrol schemes (open-loop power stage, voltage mode control, current mode\ncontrol, constant power load, constant current load, constant-on-time control,\nand boundary conduction mode) are analyzed systematically. The linearized\ndynamics is obtained simply by taking partial derivatives with respect to\ndynamic variables. In the discrete-time model, there is only a single pole and\nno zero. The single closed-loop pole is a linear combination of three terms:\nthe open-loop pole, a term due to the control scheme, and a term due to the\nnon-resistive load. Even with a single pole, the phase response of the\ndiscrete-time model can go beyond -90 degrees as in the two-pole average\nmodels. In the boost converter with a resistive load under current mode\ncontrol, adding the compensating ramp has no effect on the pole location.\nIncreasing the ramp slope decreases the DC gain of control-to-output transfer\nfunction and increases the audio-susceptibility.

The dynamics of such systems may be represented\nalgorithmically by Monte-Carlo simulations on graphs or by ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs). Despite many results in the area of network\nmodeling the selection of the best computational representation of the model\ndynamics remains a challenge. While a closed form description is often\nstraightforward to derive, it generally cannot be solved analytically; as a\nconsequence the network dynamics requires a numerical solution of the ODEs or a\ndirect Monte-Carlo simulation on the networks. Moreover, Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and ODE solutions are not equivalent since ODEs produce a\ndeterministic solution while Monte-Carlo simulations are stochastic by nature.\nDespite some recent advantages in Monte-Carlo simulations, particularly in the\nflexibility of implementation, the computational cost of an ODE solution is\nmuch lower and supports accurate and detailed output analysis such as\nuncertainty or sensitivity analyses, parameter identification etc. In this\npaper we propose a novel approach to model spreading processes in complex\nrandom heterogeneous networks using systems of nonlinear ordinary differential\nequations.

Based upon the Feigin-Semikhatov generalization\nof the Polyakov-Bershadsky algebra, we construct infinite families of unitary\nhigher-spin gravity theories at certain rational values of the Chern-Simons\nlevel that allow arbitrarily large values of the central charge up to c = N/4 -\n1/8 - O(1/N), thereby confirming a recent speculation by us 1209.2860.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 15:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 08:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

An extensive set of\nspin-transport data for Si and Ge magnetic tunnel devices reveals a scaling\nwith the tunnel resistance that violates the core feature of available\ntheories, namely, the linear proportionality of the spin voltage to the\ninjected spin current density. Instead, an anomalous scaling of the spin signal\nwith the tunnel resistance is observed, following a power-law with an exponent\nbetween 0.75 and 1 over 6 decades. The scaling extends to tunnel resistance\nvalues larger than 10$^{9}$ $\\Omega\\mu m^2$, far beyond the regime where the\nclassical impedance mismatch plays a role. This scaling is incompatible with\nexisting theory for direct tunnel injection of spins into the semiconductor. It\nalso demonstrates conclusively that the large spin signal does not originate\nfrom two-step tunneling via localized states near the oxide/semiconductor\ninterface. Control experiments on devices with a non-magnetic metal (Ru)\nelectrode, instead of the semiconductor, exhibit no Hanle spin signal, showing\nthat spin accumulation in localized states within the tunnel barrier is also\nnot responsible. Control devices in which the spin current is removed by\ninserting a non-magnetic interlayer exhibit no Hanle signals either, proving\nthat the spin signals observed in the standard devices are genuine and\noriginate from spin-polarized tunneling and the resulting spin accumulation.\nAltogether, the scaling results suggest that the spin signal is proportional to\nthe applied bias voltage, rather than the (spin) current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 15:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

They are no longer applicable to\nmicrogrids with unpredictable renewable energy supply and with co-generation\n(that needs to consider both electricity and heat demand). In this paper, we\nstudy online algorithms for the microgrid generation scheduling problem with\nintermittent renewable energy sources and co-generation, with the goal of\nmaximizing the cost-savings with local generation. Based on the insights from\nthe structure of the offline optimal solution, we propose a class of\ncompetitive online algorithms, called CHASE (Competitive Heuristic Algorithm\nfor Scheduling Energy-generation), that track the offline optimal in an online\nfashion. Under typical settings, we show that CHASE achieves the best\ncompetitive ratio among all deterministic online algorithms, and the ratio is\nno larger than a small constant 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 15:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 06:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-26"}

The result is a gravitational redshift factor\nthat is everywhere finite and positive, which both rules out gravitational\nhorizons and implies that the self-gravitationally corrected static energy\ncontained in a sphere of radius r is bounded by r times the fourth power of c\ndivided by G. Even in the absence of spherical symmetry this energy bound still\napplies to within a factor of two, and it cuts off the mass deviation of any\nquantum virtual particle at about a Planck mass. Because quantum uncertainty\nmakes the minimum possible energy of a quantum field infinite, such a field's\nself-gravitationally corrected energy attains the value of that field's\ncontaining radius r times the fourth power of c divided by G. Roughly\nestimating any quantum field's containing radius r as c times the age of the\nuniverse yields a \"dark energy\" density of 1.7 joules per cubic kilometer. But\nif r is put to the Planck length appropriate to the birth of the universe, that\nenergy density becomes the enormous Planck unit value, which could conceivably\ndrive primordial \"inflation\". The density of \"dark energy\" decreases as the\nuniverse expands, but more slowly than the density of ordinary matter\ndecreases. Such evolution suggests that \"dark energy\" has inhomogeneities,\nwhich may be \"dark matter\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2012 21:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 02:09:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2013 10:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2013 19:31:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 00:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}
