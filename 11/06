Too often, sparsity assumptions on\nthe fitted model are too restrictive to provide a faithful representation of\nthe observed data. In this paper, we present a novel framework incorporating\nsparsity in different domains.We decompose the observed covariance matrix into\na sparse Gaussian Markov model (with a sparse precision matrix) and a sparse\nindependence model (with a sparse covariance matrix). Our framework\nincorporates sparse covariance and sparse precision estimation as special cases\nand thus introduces a richer class of high-dimensional models. We characterize\nsufficient conditions for identifiability of the two models, \\viz Markov and\nindependence models. We propose an efficient decomposition method based on a\nmodification of the popular $\\ell_1$-penalized maximum-likelihood estimator\n($\\ell_1$-MLE).

Our experiments validate these results and also\ndemonstrate that our models have better inference accuracy under simple\nalgorithms such as loopy belief propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 16:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2013 07:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-17"}

The Circinus galaxy is an\nideal benchmark for the spectroastrometric technique given its proximity and\nsecure BH measurement obtained with the observation of its nuclear H2O maser\ndisk. The kinematical data have been analyzed both with the classical method\nbased on the analysis of the rotation curves and with the new method developed\nby us and based on spectroastrometry. The classical method indicates that the\ngas disk rotates in the gravitational potential of an extended stellar mass\ndistribution and a spatially unresolved mass of (1.7 +- 0.2) 10^7 Msun,\nconcentrated within r < 7 pc. The new method is capable of probing gas rotation\nat scales which are a factor ~3.5 smaller than those probed by the rotation\ncurve analysis. The dynamical mass spatially unresolved with the\nspectroastrometric method is a factor ~2 smaller, 7.9 (+1.4 -1.1) 10^6 Msun\nindicating that spectroastrometry has been able to spatially resolve the\nnuclear mass distribution down to 2 pc scales. This unresolved mass is still a\nfactor ~4.5 larger than the BH mass measurement obtained with the H2O maser\nemission indicating that it has not been possible to resolve the sphere of\ninfluence of the BH. Based on literature data, this spatially unresolved\ndynamical mass distribution is likely dominated by molecular gas and it has\nbeen tentatively identified with the circum-nuclear torus which prevents a\ndirect view of the central BH in Circinus. This mass distribution, with a size\nof ~2pc, is similar in shape to that of the star cluster of the Milky Way\nsuggesting that a molecular torus, forming stars at a high rate, might be the\nearlier evolutionary stage of the nuclear star clusters which are common in\nlate type spirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 17:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The first background\nis due to linear dilatons and the associated Kalb-Ramond field (axion) in four\nnon-compact space-time dimensions of the string, and can be described within\nthe framework of local effective lagrangians. The axion is linear in the time\ncoordinate of the Einstein frame and gives rise to a constant torsion which\ncouples to the fermion spin through a gravitational covariant derivative. This\nleads to different energy-momentum dispersion relations for fermions and\nanti-fermions and hence leptogenesis. The next two backgrounds go beyond the\nlocal effective lagrangian framework. One is a stochastic (Lorentz Violating)\nFinsler metric which again leads to different dispersion relations between\nfermions and antifermions. The third background of primary interest is the one\ndue to populations of stochastically fluctuating point-like space-time defects\nthat can be encountered in string/brane theory (D0 branes). Only neutral matter\ninteracts non-trivially with these defects, as a consequence of charge\nconservation. Hence, such a background singles out neutrinos among the Standard\nModel excitations as the ones interacting predominantly with the defects. The\nback-reaction of the defects on the space-time due to their interaction with\nneutral matter results in stochastic Finsler-like metrics (similar to our\nsecond background). On average, the stochastic fluctuations of the D0 brane\ndefects preserve Lorentz symmetry, but their variance is non-zero.\nInterestingly, the particle/antiparticle asymmetry comes out naturally to\nfavour matter over antimatter in this third background, once the effects of the\nkinematics of the scattering of the D branes with matter is incorporated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 18:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This class also includes the\nclass of $O(\\log(n))$-depth decision trees.\n  (ii) The class of polynomial-sized decision trees is polynomial time\nlearnable under product distributions using $O(\\log(n))$-local queries.\n  (iii) The class of polynomial size DNF formulas is learnable under the\nuniform distribution using $O(\\log(n))$-local queries in time\n$n^{O(\\log(\\log(n)))}$.\n  (iv) In addition we prove a number of results relating the proposed model to\nthe traditional PAC model and the PAC+MQ model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 20:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 21:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

We confirm that the fraction of barred\ngalaxies strongly depends on galaxy luminosity.

For fainter galaxies the\ninteractions become strong enough to heat up the disks inhibiting bar formation\nand even destroying the disks.

While we use the position of\neach LRG for single LRG systems, we compare the measurements using different\nhalo-center proxies for multiple-LRG systems (4.5 per cent of all the halos):\nthe brightest LRG position (BLRG), the faintest LRG position (FLRG) and their\narithmetical mean position (Mean), respectively, in each system. We find\nsignificant differences in the measured correlations of different centers,\nshowing consistent off-centering effects in the three observables. By comparing\nthe measurements with a halo model that treats the satellite photometric\ngalaxies as being distributed according to a generalized NFW profile, we find\nthat about 40 (70) per cent of BLRGs (FLRGs) are off-centered satellite\ngalaxies in the multiple-LRG systems. The satellite LRGs have typical\noff-centering radius of about 400 kpc/h, and velocity dispersion of about 500\nkm/s in host halos with a mean mass of 1.6x10^14 Ms/h.

This can be understood if the\nstar formation is self-regulating, i.e. if the star formation rate (and thus\nthe gas fraction) increase until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.\nFeedback from AGN is efficient at high masses, while increasing the initial\nwind velocity with gas pressure or halo mass allows one to generate galaxy-wide\noutflows at all masses. Matching the observed galaxy mass function requires\nefficient feedback. In particular, the predicted faint-end slope is too steep\nunless we resort to highly mass loaded winds for low-mass objects. Such\nefficient feedback from low-mass galaxies (M_* << 10^10 Msun) also reduces the\ndiscrepancy with the observed specific star formation rates, which are higher\nthan predicted unless the feedback transitions from highly efficient to\ninefficient just below the observed stellar mass range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 02:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In\nthis paper, we make several suggestions to try to clarify the role of new\nphysics in these results. We propose that the enhancement needed in the\nStandard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar\nmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely\napproximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle\nrequires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar\nwith a total energy of less than M_D. We also propose that CP asymmetries may\nbe enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. In particular, the\nfinal state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly Ds-> rho0 K+ and rho0\nK*+ likewise appear interesting. We discuss how isospin symmetry yields\nobservables sensitive to certain classes of new physics and suppressed in the\nStandard Model. Some modes considered in this context are D-> pi pi, rho pi,\nrho rho as well as Ds-> K* pi. We also consider how such analysis may\neventually be supplemented by information about the weak phases in D0 decay. In\norder to obtain this information experimentally, we consider various methods\nfor preparing an initial state which is a quantum mechanical mixture of D0 and\nD0-bar. This may be done through the use of natural D0 D0-bar oscillations;\nobserving D0-mesons which arise from Bd or Bs mesons which themselves are\noscillating or from quantum correlations in D0 pairs which arise from either\npsi\" decay or B-meson decay. Observing CP violation in the magnitudes of decay\namplitudes should be within the capability of experiments in the near future\nhowever obtaining the weak phases through the methods we discuss will likely\nrequire future generations of machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 21:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 23:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 18:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

Such sketches have seen a wide range of applications including\nnorm estimation over data streams, compressed sensing, and distributed\ncomputing. In almost any realistic setting, however, a linear sketch faces the\npossibility that its inputs are correlated with previous evaluations of the\nsketch. Known techniques no longer guarantee the correctness of the output in\nthe presence of such correlations. We therefore ask: Are linear sketches\ninherently non-robust to adaptively chosen inputs? We give a strong affirmative\nanswer to this question. Specifically, we show that no linear sketch\napproximates the Euclidean norm of its input to within an arbitrary\nmultiplicative approximation factor on a polynomial number of adaptively chosen\ninputs. The result remains true even if the dimension of the sketch is d = n -\no(n) and the sketch is given unbounded computation time. Our result is based on\nan algorithm with running time polynomial in d that adaptively finds a\ndistribution over inputs on which the sketch is incorrect with constant\nprobability. Our result implies several corollaries for related problems\nincluding lp-norm estimation and compressed sensing.

This\nprocess is induced by fast reconnection of the magnetic fields in a turbulent\nflow. In a similar numerical study, Seifried et al. (2012) concluded that\nreconnection diffusion or any other non-ideal MHD effects would not be\nnecessary and turbulence shear alone would provide a natural way to build up a\nrotating disk without requiring magnetic flux loss. Their conclusion was based\non the fact that the mean mass-to-flux ratio ({\\mu}) evaluated over a spherical\nregion with a radius much larger than the disk is nearly constant in their\nmodels. In this letter we compare the two sets of simulations and show that\nthis averaging over large scales can mask significant real increases of {\\mu}\nin the inner regions where the disk is built up.

Because no existing molecular imaging modality is ideal for all purposes,\nnew imaging approaches are needed. Here we demonstrate a novel molecular\nimaging approach, called nanodiamond imaging, that uses nanodiamonds containing\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as an imaging agent, and image nanodiamond\ntargets in pieces of chicken breast.

By combining optical\ndetection with magnetic resonance, nanodiamond imaging achieves high\nsensitivity and high spatial resolution.

Each set of light curves, including the 2008 data given by\n\\cCakirli et al., was simultaneously analyzed with the previously published\nradial-velocity curves using the Wilson-Devinney binary code. The conspicuous\nseasonal light variations of the system are satisfactorily modelled by a\ntwo-spot model with one starspot on each component and by changes of the spot\nparameters with time. Based on 23 eclipse timings calculated from the synthetic\nmodel and one ephemeris epoch, an orbital period study of NSVS 02502726 reveals\nthat the period has experienced a continuous decrease of $-5.9\\times10^{-7}$ d\nyr$^{-1}$ or a sinusoidal variation with a period and semi-amplitude of 2.51\nyrs and 0.0011 d, respectively.

For an assigned empirical differential oxygen abundance\ndistribution, which can be linearly fitted, a family of theoretical curves is\nbuilt up with assigned prescriptions. For curves with increasing cut parameter,\nthe gas mass fraction locked up into long-lived stars and remnants is found to\nattain a maximum and then decrease towards zero as the flow tends to infinity,\nwhile the remaining parameters show a monotonic trend. The theoretical integral\noxygen abundance distribution is also expressed.

Recent experiments found that, cargo transportation by two\nmotor species has a memory, it does not change its direction as frequently as\nexpected, which means that its forward and backward step rates depends on its\nprevious motion trajectory. By assuming cargo has only the least memory, i.e.\nits step direction depends only on the direction of its last step, two cases of\ncargo motion are detailed analyzed in this study: {\\bf (I)} cargo motion under\nconstant external load; and {\\bf (II)} cargo motion in one fixed optical trap.\nDue to the existence of memory, for the first case, cargo can keep moving in\nthe same direction for a long distance. For the second case, the cargo will\noscillate in the trap.

The most likely location of cargo, where the\nprobability of finding the oscillated cargo is maximum, may be the same as or\nmay be different with the trap center, which depends on the step rates of the\ntwo motor species.

Assuming that the sensor data is sparse in some basis, we show\nthat the recovery of this sparse signal can be formulated as a compressive\nsensing (CS) problem. To model the scenario in which the sensors operate with\nintermittently available energy that is harvested from the environment, we\npropose that each sensor transmits independently with some probability, and\nadapts the transmit power to its harvested energy. Due to the probabilistic\ntransmissions, the elements of the equivalent sensing matrix are not Gaussian.\nBesides, since the sensors have different energy harvesting rates and different\nsensor-to-FC distances, the FC has different receive signal-to-noise ratios\n(SNRs) for each sensor. This is referred to as the inhomogeneity of SNRs. Thus,\nthe elements of the sensing matrix are also not identically distributed. For\nthis unconventional setting, we provide theoretical guarantees on the number of\nmeasurements for reliable and computationally efficient recovery, by showing\nthat the sensing matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), under\nreasonable conditions. We then compute an achievable system delay under an\nallowable mean-squared-error (MSE). Furthermore, using techniques from large\ndeviations theory, we analyze the impact of inhomogeneity of SNRs on the\nso-called k-restricted eigenvalues, which governs the number of measurements\nrequired for the RIP to hold. We conclude that the number of measurements\nrequired for the RIP is not sensitive to the inhomogeneity of SNRs, when the\nnumber of sensors n is large and the sparsity of the sensor data (signal) k\ngrows slower than the square root of n.

A common technical challenge in these problems\nis to optimize some function of the sum of a set of random variables. The\ndifficulty is mainly due to the fact that the probability distribution of the\nsum is the convolution of a set of distributions, which is not an easy\nobjective function to work with. To tackle this difficulty, we introduce the\nPoisson approximation technique. The technique is based on the Poisson\napproximation theorem discovered by Le Cam, which enables us to approximate the\ndistribution of the sum of a set of random variables using a compound Poisson\ndistribution.\n  We first study the expected utility maximization problem introduced recently\n[Li and Despande, FOCS11].

This generalizes the previous work [Balghat,\nGoel and Khanna, SODA11] for the case without correlation and cancelation. Our\nalgorithm is also simpler.

At strong\nmagnetic field the ground state has a massless mode corresponding to the\nGoldstone boson associated with the spontaneously broken U(1) R-symmetry\nanalogous to the eta' meson in QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 09:50:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 20:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2014 21:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-24"}

Constituent fermion masses are generated\nthrough a yukawa interaction of the fermion with a scalar (or /and\npsuedoscalar) field via the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar (or\nand psuedoscalar) field. We especially consider the high baryon density $\\pi_0$\ncondensed phase, in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, with space\nvarying expectation values of the $ \\sigma$ and $\\pi_0$ fields. This phase has\na spin polarized fermi sea as the ground state.

Furthermore, this analysis\nreveals that the magnetization of this state goes up as the VEV, that\ndetermines the 'mass', comes down with increasing baryon density. The\nconsequent high magnetic field that is generated will destabilize this state at\na threshold density.

For the latter response, we assume social\nherding, i.e. agents adopt their strategy based on the frequencies of the\ndifferent strategies in their neighborhood, without taking into account the\nconsequences of this decision. We note that f_i already determines the payoff,\nso there is no additional information assumed. A parameter \\zeta defines to\nwhat level agents take the two different information sources into account. For\nthe strategic interaction, we assume a Prisoner's Dilemma game, i.e. one in\nwhich defection is the evolutionary stable strategy.

By means of agent-based computer\nsimulations and analytical investigations, we evaluate the critical conditions\nfor this transition towards cooperation. We find that, in addition to a high\ndegree of social herding, there has to be a nonlinear response to the fraction\nof cooperators. We argue that the transition to cooperation in our model is\nbased on less information, i.e. on agents which are not informed about the\npayoff matrix, and therefore rely on just observing the strategy of others, to\nadopt it. By designing the right mechanisms to respond to this information, the\ntransition to cooperation can be remarkably enhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 11:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-07"}

We find\nevidence that four powers in the polynomial are sufficient for extremely high\nprecision. Applying this to valence and sea quarks we find an improvement in\nthe global fit, but a significant change only in the small-$x$ valence up-quark\nPDF, $u_V$. We investigate the effect of also extending, and making more\nflexible, the `nuclear' correction to deuteron structure functions. The\nextended `Chebyshev' parameterisation results in an improved stability in the\ndeuteron corrections that are required for the best fit to the `global' data.\nThe resulting PDFs have a significantly, but not dramatically, altered valence\ndown-quark distribution, $d_V$. For the extended set of MSTW PDFs, their\nuncertainties can be obtained using 23, rather than the usual 20, orthogonal\n`uncertainty' eigenvectors. Since the dominant effect is on the valence quarks,\nwe present a detailed study of the dependence of the valence--sea separation on\nthe predictions for the decay lepton charge asymmetry which results from\n$W^\\pm$ production at the LHC, illustrating the PDFs and the $x$ range probed\nfor different experimental scenarios. We show that the modified MSTW PDFs make\nsignificantly improved predictions for these data at the LHC, particularly for\nhigh values of the $p_T$ cut of the decay lepton. However, this is a special\ncase, since the asymmetry is extremely sensitive to valence--sea details, and\nin particular to the combination $u_V-d_V$ of valence PDFs for $x \\sim\nM_W/\\sqrt{s}$ at low lepton rapidities. We show that the predictions for a wide\nvariety of total cross sections are very similar to those obtained using the\nMSTW2008 PDFs, with changes being much smaller than the PDF uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 13:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 17:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-18"}

Understanding the properties of globular cluster\nsystems can lead to important insights on the evolution of its host galaxy.\nAims: We aim to obtain the stellar population parameters - age and metallicity\n- of a sample of M31 and Galactic globular clusters. Studying their globular\ncluster systems is an important step towards understanding their formation and\nevolution in a complete way. Methods: Our analysis employs a modern\npixel-to-pixel spectral fitting technique to fit observed integrated spectra to\nupdated stellar population models. By comparing observations to models we\nobtain the ages and metallicities of their stellar populations. We apply this\ntechnique to a sample of 38 globular clusters in M31 and to 41 Galactic\nglobular clusters, used as a control sample. Results: Our sample of M31\nglobular clusters spans ages from 150 Myr to the age of the Universe.\nMetallicities [Fe/H] range from -2.2 dex to the solar value. The\nage-metallicity relation obtained can be described as having two components: an\nold population with a flat age-[Fe/H] relation, possibly associated with the\nhalo and/or bulge, and a second one with a roughly linear relation between age\nand metallicity, higher metallicities corresponding to younger ages, possibly\nassociated with the M31 disk. While we recover the very well known Galactic GC\nmetallicity bimodality, our own analysis of M31's metallicity distribution\nfunction (MDF) suggests that both GC systems cover basically the same [Fe/H]\nrange yet M31's MDF is not clearly bimodal.

We report on the recent observations of the supernova remnant SNR 1987A\nin the Large Magellanic Cloud with XMM-Newton. Carefully monitoring the\nevolution of the X-ray light curve allows to probe the complex circumstellar\nmedium structure observed around the supernova progenitor star.\n  Methods. We analyse all XMM-Newton observations of SNR 1987A from January\n2007 to December 2011, using data from the EPIC-pn camera. Spectra from all\nepochs are extracted and analysed in a homogeneous way. Using a multi-shock\nmodel to fit the spectra across the 0.2-10 keV band we measure soft and hard\nX-ray fluxes with high accuracy. In the hard X-ray band we examine the presence\nand properties of Fe K ines. Our findings are interpreted in the framework of a\nhydrodynamics-based model.\n  Results. The soft X-ray flux of SNR 1987A continuously increased in the\nrecent years. Although the light curve shows a mild flattening, there is no\nsudden break as reported in an earlier work, a picture echoed by a revision of\nthe Chandra light curve. We therefore conclude that material in the equatorial\nring and out-of-plane HII regions are still being swept-up. We estimate the\nthickness of the equatorial ring to be at least 4.5x10^16 cm (0.0146 pc). This\nlower limit will increase as long as the soft X-ray flux has not reached a\nturn-over. We detect a broad Fe K line in all spectra from 2007 to 2011. The\nwidths and centroid energies of the lines indicate the presence of a collection\nof iron ionisation stages. Thermal emission from the hydrodynamic model does\nnot reproduce the low-energy part of the line (6.4-6.5 keV), suggesting that\nfluorescence from neutral and/or low ionisation Fe might be present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 13:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

At low\ntemperature, a large pairing gap of the paired colors suppresses the pairing\nfluctuation effects for the unpaired color, and the spectral density of the\nunpaired color shows a single Fermi-liquid peak, which indicates the naive\nmean-field picture remains valid.

We construct an\nanalytic approximation fitting very well modern EOSs of 2SC and CFL color\nsuperconducting phases of quark matter. This allows us for simulating continua\nof sequences of first-order phase transitions from hadronic matter to the 2SC,\nand then to the CFL state of color superconducting quark matter.\n  We obtain constraints in the parameter space of the EOS of superconducting\nquark cores, resulting from M_max> 2 M_sol. We also derive constraints that\nwould result from significantly higher measured masses. For 2.4 M_sol required\nstiffness of the CFL quark core should have been close to the causality limit,\nthe density jump at the phase transition being very small.\n  Condition M_max > 2 M_sol puts strong constraints on the EOSs of the 2SC and\nCFL phases of quark matter. Density jumps at the phase transitions have to be\nsufficiently small and sound speeds in quark matter - sufficiently large. A\nstrict condition of thermodynamic stability of quark phase results in the\nmaximum mass of hybrid stars similar to that of purely baryon stars. Therefore,\nto get M_max>2 M_sol for stable hybrid stars, both sufficiently strong\nadditional hyperon repulsion at high density baryon matter and a sufficiently\nstiff EOS of quark matter would be needed. However, it is likely that the high\ndensity instability of quark matter (reconfinement) indicates actually the\ninadequacy of the point-particle model of baryons in dense matter at very high\ndensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 14:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

We illustrate this by\nperforming the anatomy of flavour violation in the 331 models, based on the\ngauge group SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X that are among the simplest NP scenarios\nwith new sources of flavour and CP violation. The latter originate dominantly\nthrough the flavour violating interactions of ordinary quarks and leptons with\na new heavy Z' gauge boson. After discussing first these models in some\ngenerality, we present a detailed study of Delta F=2 observables and of rare K\nand B meson decays in the specific beta=1/\\sqrt{3} model (to be called\noverline{331} model) assuming significantly smaller uncertainties in CKM and\nhadronic parameters than presently available. The most prominent roles in our\nanalysis play epsilon_K, Delta M_q (q=d,s), the mixing induced CP asymmetries\nS_{psi K_S} and S_{psi phi}, rare decays B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- and in particular\nthe CP-asymmetry S_{mu^+ mu^-}^s in B_s ->mu^+ mu^-. We identify a number of\ncorrelations between various observables that differ from those known from CMFV\nmodels. While, the Delta F=2 observables allow still for four oases in the new\nparameter space, we demonstrate how the inclusion of Delta F=1 observables can\nin the future identify the optimal oasis for this model. For 1 TeV <= M_{Z'}<=\n3 TeV the overline{331} model is in good agreement with the recent data for\nB^+->tau^+ nu_tau, it removes the epsilon_K-S_{psi K_S} tension present in the\nSM and the epsilon_K-Delta M_{s,d} tension present in CMFV models.\nSimultaneously, while differing from the SM, it is consistent with the present\ndata on BR(B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^-) and S_{psi phi}. We identify the triple\ncorrelation BR(B_s->mu^+ mu^-)-S_{psi phi}-S_{mu^+ mu^-}^s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 14:31:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 10:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-13"}

The computational expense of parameter estimation is\ndominated by waveform generation and scales linearly with the waveform\ncomputational cost. Previous work showed that gravitational waveforms from\nnon-spinning compact binary sources are amenable to a truncated singular value\ndecomposition, which allows them to be reconstructed via interpolation at fixed\ncomputational cost. However, the accuracy requirement for parameter estimation\nis typically higher than for searches, so it is crucial to ascertain that\ninterpolation does not lead to significant errors.

Depending on the physical context, a\nstar, planet or satellite can behave very nearly like a test-particle, so\ngeodesic motion is used to calculate the advance of the perihelion of a\nplanet's orbit, the dynamics of a binary pulsar system and of an Earth orbiting\nsatellite. Verifying geodesic motion is then a test of paramount importance to\nGeneral Relativity and other theories of fundamental physics. On the basis of\nthe first few months of observations of the recently launched satellite LARES,\nits orbit shows the best agreement of any satellite with the test-particle\nmotion predicted by General Relativity. That is, after modelling its known\nnon-gravitational perturbations, the LARES orbit shows the smallest deviations\nfrom geodesic motion of any artificial satellite. LARES-type satellites can\nthus be used for accurate measurements and for tests of gravitational and\nfundamental physics. Already with only a few months of observation, LARES\nprovides smaller scatter in the determination of several low-degree\ngeopotential coefficients (Earth gravitational deviations from sphericity) than\navailable from observations of any other satellite or combination of\nsatellites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 13:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-05"}
