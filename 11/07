We\nre-analyse the available HARPS and HIRES Doppler data in an attempt to\ndetermine the false positive rate of our Bayesian data analysis techniques and\nto count the number of Keplerian signals in the GJ 581 data. We apply the\ncommon Lomb-Scargle periodograms and posterior sampling techniques in the\nBayesian framework to estimate the number of signals in the radial velocities.\nWe also analyse the HARPS velocities sequentially after each full observing\nperiod to compare the sensitivities and false positive rates of the two signal\ndetection techniques. By relaxing the assumption that the radial velocity noise\nis white, we also demonstrate the consequences that noise correlations have on\nthe obtained results and the significances of the signals. According to our\nanalyses, the number of Keplerian signals favoured by the publicly available\nHARPS and HIRES radial velocity data of GJ 581 is four. This result relies on\nthe sensitivity of the Bayesian statistical analysis techniques but also\ndepends on the assumed noise model. We also show that the radial velocity noise\nis actually not white and that this feature has to be accounted for when\nanalysing radial velocities in a search for low-amplitude signals corresponding\nto low-mass planets. ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 16:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-07"}

A protein's\nthree-dimensional (3D) structure hence leaves an echo of correlations in the\nevolutionary record. Reverse engineering 3D structures from such correlations\nis an open problem in structural biology, pursued with increasing vigor as more\nand more protein sequences continue to fill the data banks. Within this task\nlies a statistical inference problem, rooted in the following: correlation\nbetween two sites in a protein sequence can arise from firsthand interaction\nbut can also be network-propagated via intermediate sites; observed correlation\nis not enough to guarantee proximity. To separate direct from indirect\ninteractions is an instance of the general problem of inverse statistical\nmechanics, where the task is to learn model parameters (fields, couplings) from\nobservables (magnetizations, correlations, samples) in large systems. In the\ncontext of protein sequences, the approach has been referred to as\ndirect-coupling analysis. Here we show that the pseudolikelihood method,\napplied to 21-state Potts models describing the statistical properties of\nfamilies of evolutionarily related proteins, significantly outperforms existing\napproaches to the direct-coupling analysis, the latter being based on standard\nmean-field techniques. This improved performance also relies on a modified\nscore for the coupling strength.

Interestingly, we\nfound that annealing in N2 also leads to superconductivity enhancement, similar\nto the annealing effects of O2, I2 and air.

Our analyses of these results\nsupport the argument that the superconductivity enhancement, caused either by\nannealing or nitric acid treatment, originates from the variation of\ninterstitial Fe. The interstitial Fe, which is destructive to superconducting\npairing, can be reduced by annealing in oxidation agents or nitric acid\ntreatment.

The localization method used is called selective LES and is based\non the exploitation of a scalar probe function $f$ which represents the\nmagnitude of the stretching-tilting term of the vorticity equation normalized\nwith the enstrophy (Tordella et al. 2007). For a fully developed turbulent\nfield of fluctuations, statistical analysis shows that the probability that $f$\nis larger than 2 is almost zero, and, for any given threshold, it is larger if\nthe flow is under-resolved. By computing the spatial field of $f$ in each\ninstantaneous realization of the simulation it is possible to locate the\nregions where the magnitude of the normalized vortical stretching-tilting is\nanomalously high. The sub-grid model is then introduced into the governing\nequations in such regions only. The results of the selective LES simulation are\ncompared with those of a standard LES, where the sub-grid terms are used in the\nwhole domain, and with those of a standard Euler simulation with the same\nresolution. The comparison is carried out by assuming as reference field a\nhigher resolution Euler simulation of the same jet. It is shown that the\nselective LES modifies the dynamic properties of the flow to a lesser extent\nwith respect to the classical LES. In particular, the prediction of the\nenstrophy, mean velocity and density distributions and of the energy and\ndensity spectra are substantially improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 16:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 20:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Learning curves show the model performance as function of the\ntraining sample size and can help to determine the sample size needed to train\ngood classifiers. However, building a good model is actually not enough: the\nperformance must also be proven. We discuss learning curves for typical small\nsample size situations with 5 - 25 independent samples per class. Although the\nclassification models achieve acceptable performance, the learning curve can be\ncompletely masked by the random testing uncertainty due to the equally limited\ntest sample size. In consequence, we determine test sample sizes necessary to\nachieve reasonable precision in the validation and find that 75 - 100 samples\nwill usually be needed to test a good but not perfect classifier. Such a data\nset will then allow refined sample size planning on the basis of the achieved\nperformance. We also demonstrate how to calculate necessary sample sizes in\norder to show the superiority of one classifier over another: this often\nrequires hundreds of statistically independent test samples or is even\ntheoretically impossible.

Neutral helium atoms enhance the damping\nin certain temperature interval, where the ratio of neutral helium and neutral\nhydrogen atoms is increased. Therefore, the height-dependence of ionization\ndegrees of hydrogen and helium may influence the damping rate of Alfven waves.\nWe aim to study the effect of neutral helium in the damping of Alfven waves in\nstratified partially ionized plasma of the solar chromosphere. We consider a\nmagnetic flux tube, which is expanded up to 1000 km height and then becomes\nvertical due to merging with neighboring tubes, and study the dynamics of\nlinear torsional Alfven waves in the presence of neutral hydrogen and neutral\nhelium atoms. We start with three-fluid description of plasma and consequently\nderive single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for torsional Alfven\nwaves. Thin flux tube approximation allows to obtain the dispersion relation of\nthe waves in the lower part of tubes, while the spatial dependence of\nsteady-state Alfven waves is governed by Bessel type equation in the upper part\nof tubes. Consecutive derivation of single-fluid MHD equations results in a new\nCowling diffusion coefficient in the presence of neutral helium which is\ndifferent from previously used one. We found that shorter-period (< 5 s)\ntorsional Alfven waves damp quickly in the chromospheric network due to\nion-neutral collision. On the other hand, longer-period (> 5 s) waves do not\nreach the transition region as they become evanescent at lower heights in the\nnetwork cores. Propagation of torsional Alfven waves through the chromosphere\ninto the solar corona should be considered with caution: low-frequency waves\nare evanescent due to the stratification, while high-frequency waves are damped\ndue to ion neutral collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 18:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 09:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We present here the first study of the expected dark matter\ndetection signal taking into account different self-scattering models. We\ndemonstrate that models with constant and velocity dependent cross sections,\nwhich are consistent with observational constraints, lead to distinct\nsignatures in the velocity distribution, because non-thermalised features found\nin the cold dark matter distribution are thermalised through particle\nscattering. Depending on the model, self-interaction can lead to a 10%\nreduction of the recoil rates at high energies, corresponding to a minimum\nspeed that can cause recoil larger than 300 km/s, compared to the cold dark\nmatter case. At lower energies these differences are smaller than 5% for all\nmodels. The amplitude of the annual modulation signal can increase by up to\n25%, and the day of maximum amplitude can shift by about two weeks with respect\nto the cold dark matter expectation.

How\nit relates to the properties of embedded clusters, in particular to the\nrecently established radius-density relation, has so far not been investigated.\nIn this paper, we model the development of the stellar component of molecular\nclumps as a function of time and initial local volume density so as to provide\na coherent framework able to explain both the molecular-cloud and\nembedded-cluster relations quoted above. To do so, we associate the observed\nvolume density gradient of molecular clumps to a density-dependent free-fall\ntime. The molecular clump star formation history is obtained by applying a\nconstant SFE per free-fall time, $\\eff$.\n  For volume density profiles typical of observed molecular clumps (i.e.\npower-law slope $\\simeq -1.7$), our model gives a star-gas surface-density\nrelation $\\Sigma_{\\star} \\propto \\Sigma_{gas}^2$, in very good agreement with\nthe Gutermuth et al relation.

In a resonance lock, the orbital and spin\nfrequencies evolve in lockstep, so that the tidal forcing frequency is\napproximately constant and a particular normal mode remains resonant, producing\nefficient tidal dissipation and nearly synchronous rotation. We show that\nanalogous locks between the spin and orbital frequencies can occur not only\nwith global standing modes, but even when damping is so efficient that the\nresonant tidal response becomes a traveling wave. We derive simple analytic\nformulas for the tidal quality factor Q and tidal heating rate during a g-mode\nresonance lock, and verify our results numerically.

In its\nsimplest realization, an SU(2) gauge field is assumed to begin inflation in a\nrotationally invariant VEV. The dynamics of the gauge fields significantly\nmodifies the equations of motion for the axion, providing an additional damping\nterm that supports slow-roll inflation, without the need to fine tune the axion\ndecay constant. We demonstrate that in an appropriate slow-roll limit it is\npossible to integrate out the massive gauge field fluctuations whilst still\nmaintaining the nontrivial modifications of the gauge field to the axion. In\nthis slow-roll limit, chromo-natural inflation is exactly equivalent to a\nsingle scalar field effective theory with a non-minimal kinetic term, i.e. a\nP(X,\\chi) model. This occurs through a precise analogue of the gelaton\nmechanism, whereby heavy fields can have unsuppressed effects on the light\nfield dynamics without contradicting decoupling. The additional damping effect\nof the gauge fields can be completely captured by the non-minimal kinetic term\nof the single scalar field effective theory. We utilize the single scalar field\neffective theory to infer the power spectrum and non-gaussianities in\nchromo-natural inflation and confirm that the mass squared of all the gauge\nfield fluctuations is sufficiently large and positive that they completely\ndecouple during inflation.

We derive a new galaxy\n[Fe/H]-M(star) relation as a function of z, and by assuming that GCs share the\nmetallicity of their parent galaxy when they form, we populate the merger tree\nwith GCs. We perform a series of Monte-Carlo simulations of the galaxy\nassembly, and study the properties of the final GC population as a function of\ngalaxy mass, assembly and star formation history, and under different\nassumptions for the evolution of the galaxy mass-[Fe/H] relation. The main\nresults are: 1) The hierarchical clustering scenario naturally predicts a\nmetallicity bimodality in the galaxy GC population: the metal-rich GCs are\nformed in the galaxy main progenitor around z~2, and the metal-poor GCs are\naccreted from satellites and formed at z~3-4. 2) The model reproduces the\nobserved relations for the metallicity of the metal-rich and metal-poor GCs as\na function of galaxy mass. The positions of the metal-poor and metal-rich peaks\ndepend exclusively on the evolution of the galaxy mass-[Fe/H] relation and the\n[O/Fe], both of which can be constrained by this method.

These have been explained in terms of the\nrelative abundance of species, using a null model that assigns links in\nproportion to abundance, but doubts have been raised as to whether this offers\na complete explanation. In particular, host-parasite networks offer a variety\nof examples in which the reverse patterns are observed.\n  We propose that the link between specificity and species-richness may also be\ndriven by the co-evolution of hosts and parasites, as hosts allocate resources\nto optimize defence against parasites, and parasites to optimize attack on\nhosts. In this hypothesis, species interactions are a result of resource\nallocations. This novel concept, linking together many different arguments for\nnetwork structures, is introduced through the adaptive dynamics of a simple\necological toy system of two hosts and two parasites.\n  We analyse the toy model and its functionality, demonstrating that\nco-evolution leads to specialization asymmetry in networks with closely related\nparasites or fast host mutation rates, but not in networks with more distantly\nrelated species. Having constructed the toy model and tested its applicability,\nour model can now be expanded to the full problem of a larger system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 09:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

An example of a four-level STED system is analyzed in\nanalogy to a four-level laser system, but the special space dependence of the\nSTED light is taken into account, restricting the fluorescence from extremely\nsmall volume, and thus extremely high resolution is obtained. Localization of\nindividual molecules is described by the FPALM method where interference\nbetween coherent fluorescent photons is taken into account. While in the STED\nmethod very high laser intensities are needed in its variant method known as\nRESOLFT the super-resolution measurements can be obtained by much weaker light\nintensities.

One special case, considered in this\nnote, is the so-called `massless limit' in which all four daughter objects\n(comprising one invisible particle and one visible system from each `side' of\nthe event) have zero mass. This note establishes that it is possible to\nconstruct a stable and accurate implementation for evaluating MT2 based on an\nanalytic expression valid in that massless limit. Although this implementation\nis found to have no significant speed improvements over existing evaluation\nstrategies, it leads to an unexpected by-product: namely a secondary variable,\nthat is found to be very similar to MT2 for much of its input-space and yet is\nmuch faster to calculate. This is potentially of interest for hardware\napplications that require very fast estimation of a mass scale (or QCD\nbackground discriminant) based on a hypothesis of pair production -- as might\nbe required by a high luminosity trigger for a search for pair production of\nnew massive states undergoing few subsequent decays (eg di-squark or di-slepton\nproduction). This is an application to which the contransverse mass MCT has\npreviously been well suited due to its simplicity and ease of evaluation.\nThough the new variable requires a quadratic root to be found, it (like MCT)\ndoes not require iteration to compute, and is found to perform better then MCT\nin circumstances in which the information from the missing transverse momentum\n(which the former retains and the latter discards) is both reliable and useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 13:25:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 10:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2013 08:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}

Rotational splittings for stochastically\nexcited dipolar modes are computed adopting a first-order perturbative approach\nfor two $1.3 M_\\odot$ benchmark models assuming slowly rotating cores. For red\ngiant stars with slowly rotating cores, we show that the variation of the\nrotational splittings of $\\ell=1$ modes with frequency depends only on the\nlarge frequency separation, the g-mode period spacing, and the ratio of the\naverage envelope to core rotation rates (${\\cal R}$).

We start from the assumption that the space-time can\nbe described as a non-Riemannian manifold, which, in addition to the metric\nfield, is endowed with torsion. In this new framework, the gravitational field\nis represented not only by the metric, but also by the torsion, which is\ncompletely determined by a geometric scalar field. We show that in this\nformulation general relativity has a new kind of invariance, whose invariance\ngroup consists of a set of conformal and gauge transformations, called Cartan\ntransformations. These involve both the metric tensor and the torsion vector\nfield, and are similar to the well known Weyl gauge transformations. By making\nuse of the concept of Cartan gauges, we show that, under Cartan\ntransformations, the new formalism leads to different pictures of the same\ngravitational phenomena. We show that in an arbitrary Cartan gauge general\nrelativity has the form of a scalar-tensor theory. In this approach, the\nRiemann-Cartan geometry appears as the natural geometrical setting of the\ngeneral relativity theory when the latter is viewed in an arbitrary Cartan\ngauge. We illustrate this fact by looking at the one of the classical tests of\ngeneral relativity theory, namely the gravitational spectral shift.

Our objective is to discover a set of low dimensional affine\nsubspaces that represents manifold data accurately while preserving the\nmanifold's structure. For this purpose, we employ a greedy technique that\npartitions manifold samples into groups that can be each approximated by a low\ndimensional subspace. We start by considering each manifold sample as a\ndifferent group and we use the difference of tangents to determine appropriate\ngroup mergings. We repeat this procedure until we reach the desired number of\nsample groups. The best low dimensional affine subspaces corresponding to the\nfinal groups constitute our approximate manifold representation. Our\nexperiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and show its\nsuperior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for manifold\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 19:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

In addition, we assume the presence of a constant gauge\nfield which, due to the nontrivial topology of background space, leads to\nAharonov-Bohm-like effects on the expectation values. By using the\nAbel-Plana-type summation formula and zeta function techniques, two different\nrepresentations are provided for both the current and charge densities. The\ncurrent density has nonzero components along the compact dimensions only and,\nin the absence of a gauge field, it vanishes for special cases of twisted and\nuntwisted scalar fields. In the high-temperature limit, the current density and\nthe topological part in the charge density are linear functions of the\ntemperature. The Bose-Einstein condensation for a fixed value of the charge is\ndiscussed. The expression for the chemical potential is given in terms of the\nlengths of compact dimensions, temperature and gauge field. It is shown that\nthe parameters of the phase transition can be controlled by tuning the gauge\nfield. The separate contributions to the charge and current densities coming\nfrom the Bose-Einstein condensate and from excited states are also\ninvestigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 18:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}
