This is fitted to a single temperature plasma\nemission model to provide an estimate of the gas density and temperature, which\nare sensitive to the gas inhomogeneities. Therefore, X-ray observations yield a\npotentially biased estimate of the thermal gas pressure, P_X. At the same time\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations directly measure the integrated gas\npressure, P_SZ. If the X-ray pressure profiles are strongly biased with respect\nto the SZ, then one has the possibility to probe the gas inhomogeneities, even\nat scales unresolved by the current generation of telescopes. At the same time,\na weak bias has implications for the interchangeable use of mass proxies like\nY_SZ and Y_X as cosmological probes. In this paper we investigate the\ndependence of the bias, defined as b_P(r)=P_X(r)/P_SZ(r)-1, on the\ncharacteristics of fluctuations in the ICM taking into account the correlation\nbetween temperature and density fluctuations. We made a simple prediction of\nthe irreducible bias in idealised X-ray vs SZ observations using\nmulti-temperature plasma emission model.

In addition, the\napparent extinctions of our candidate associations correlate well with the\npredictions from a Galactic model. These facts, along with the clear detection\nof a known OB association and the previous spectral verification of one cluster\nfound by this method, validate our method. Only one of the searched WMAP\nsources remains without a candidate. In 8 of the most luminous WMAP sources,\nthe candidate associations can account for the observed free-free flux.

Of particular note is the\ncoupling of meta-heuristic search engines with user-provided evaluation and\nrating of solutions, usually in the form of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms\n(IEAs). These have a well-documented history of successes, but arguably the\npreponderance of IEAs stems from this history, rather than as a conscious\ndesign choice of meta-heuristic based on the characteristics of the problem at\nhand. This paper sets out to examine the basis for that assumption, taking as a\ncase study the domain of interactive software design. We consider a range of\nfactors that should affect the design choice including ease of use,\nscalability, and of course, performance, i.e. that ability to generate good\nsolutions within the limited number of evaluations available in interactive\nwork before humans lose focus. We then evaluate three methods, namely greedy\nlocal search, an evolutionary algorithm and ant colony optimization, with a\nvariety of representations for candidate solutions. Results show that after\nsuitable parameter tuning, ant colony optimization is highly effective within\ninteractive search and out-performs evolutionary algorithms with respect to\nincreasing numbers of attributes and methods in the software design problem.\nHowever, when larger numbers of classes are present in the software design, an\nevolutionary algorithm using a naive grouping integer-based representation\nappears more scalable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 18:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-15"}

It has been thought for two decades that very few of these\nBHs could be retained through the cluster lifetime. With masses ~10 MSun, BHs\nare ~20 times more massive than an average cluster star. They segregate into\nthe cluster core, where they may eventually decouple from the remainder of the\ncluster. The small-N core then evaporates on a short timescale. This is the\nso-called Spitzer instability. Here we present the results of a full dynamical\nsimulation of a globular cluster containing many stellar-mass BHs with a\nrealistic mass spectrum. Our Monte Carlo simulation code includes detailed\ntreatments of all relevant stellar evolution and dynamical processes. Our main\nfinding is that old globular clusters could still contain many BHs at present.\nIn our simulation, we find no evidence for the Spitzer instability. Instead,\nmost of the BHs remain well-mixed with the rest of the cluster, with only the\ninnermost few tens of BHs segregating significantly. Over the 12 Gyr evolution,\nfewer than half of the BHs are dynamically ejected through strong binary\ninteractions in the cluster core. The presence of BHs leads to long-term\nheating of the cluster, ultimately producing a core radius on the high end of\nthe distribution for Milky Way globular clusters (and those of other galaxies).\nA crude extrapolation from our model suggests that the BH--BH merger rate from\nglobular clusters could be comparable to the rate in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 18:22:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2013 05:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This motivated us to study here social evolution\nin a large class of group structured populations, with arbitrary\nmulti-individual interactions among group members and random migration among\ngroups. Under the assumption of weak selection, we analyze the equilibria and\ntheir stability. For some significant models of social evolution with\nnon-linear fitness functions, including contingent behavior in iterated public\ngoods games and threshold models, we show that three regimes occur, depending\non the migration rate among groups. For sufficiently high migration rates, a\nrare cooperative allele A cannot invade a monomorphic population of asocial\nalleles N. For sufficiently low values of the migration rate, allele A can\ninvade the population, when rare, and then fixate, eliminating N. For\nintermediate values of the migration rate, allele A can invade the population,\nwhen rare, producing a polymorphic equilibrium, in which it coexists with N.\nThe equilibria and their stability do not depend on the details of the\npopulation structure. The levels of migration (gene flow) and group relatedness\nthat allow for invasion of the cooperative allele leading to polymorphic\nequilibria with the non-cooperative allele are common in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 18:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-15"}

This framework\nenriches the set the solutions, as other posterior estimates can be used as a\nsolution to the inverse problem, such as the posterior mean that can be easier\nto compute in practice. In this paper we prove consistency of Bayesian\nsolutions of an ill-posed linear inverse problem in the Ky Fan metric for a\ngeneral class of likelihoods and prior distributions in a finite dimensional\nsetting. This result can be applied to study infinite dimensional problems by\nletting the dimension of the unknown parameter grow to infinity which can be\nviewed as discretisation on a grid or spectral approximation of an infinite\ndimensional problem. Likelihood and the prior distribution are assumed to be in\nan exponential form that includes distributions from the exponential family,\nand to be differentiable. The observations can be dependent.

Comparing the measured cooling rates of\nthese stars with the expected values from theoretical models allows us to\nsearch for sources of additional cooling due to the emission of weakly\ninteracting particles. In this paper, we present an independent inference of\nthe mass of the axion using the recent determination of the evolutionary\ncooling rate of R548, the DAV class prototype. We employ a state-of-the-art\ncode which allows us to perform a detailed asteroseismological fit based on\nfully evolutionary sequences. Stellar cooling is the solely responsible of the\nrates of change of period with time ($\\dot\\Pi$) for the DAV class. Thus, the\ninclusion of axion emission in these sequences notably influences the\nevolutionary timescales, and also the expected pulsational properties of the\nDAV stars. This allows us to compare the theoretical $\\dot\\Pi$ values to the\ncorresponding empirical rate of change of period with time of R548 to discern\nthe presence of axion cooling. We found that if the dominant period at 213.13 s\nin R548 is associated with a pulsation mode trapped in the hydrogen envelope,\nour models indicate the existence of additional cooling in this pulsating white\ndwarf, consistent with axions of mass $m_{\\rm a} \\cos^2 \\beta \\sim 17.1$ meV at\na 2$\\sigma$ confidence level. This determination is in agreement with the value\ninferred from another well-studied DAV, G117$-$B15A.

This doesn't appear to be\nconsistent with the X-ray flux and spectrum of the source, which has remained\nessentially unchanged since the initial outburst. The iron abundance implied by\nthe ratio of the neutral Fe-K$\\alpha$ and Fe-K$\\beta$ is compatible with solar.\nWe search for lags in the neutral Fe-K$\\alpha$ with respect to the continuum\nand find marginal evidence for a lag at ~10 ks. We interpret this as the light\ncrossing time of the torus which would suggest that the neutral iron is located\nat a radius of 10 AU. This result depends on several assumptions including the\ndistance to the system, the inclination, the mass of system and the orbital\nperiod none of which are known with any great certainty. Better constraints on\nthese system parameters and further observations of this system are required to\nconfirm this result. We discuss the nature of this system in light of our\nresults and place it in context with other binary B[e] stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 20:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

When applied to CMB maps which have a detectable level of\nnon-Gaussianity the standard estimator is no longer optimal, possibly limiting\nthe sensitivity of future observations to a non-Gaussian signal. Previous\nstudies have proposed an improved estimator by using a realization-dependent\nnormalization.

The direct method\nmass-metallicity relation has a steeper slope, a lower turnover mass, and a\nfactor of two to three greater dependence on SFR than strong line\nmass-metallicity relations. Furthermore, the SFR-dependence appears monotonic\nwith stellar mass, unlike strong line mass-metallicity relations. We also\nmeasure the N/O abundance ratio, an important tracer of star formation history,\nand find the clear signature of primary and secondary nitrogen enrichment. N/O\ncorrelates tightly with oxygen abundance, and even more so with stellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 23:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Since the method relies on\nsolving an eigenvector problem, it is computationally expensive for large\ndatasets. To overcome this constraint, approximation methods have been\ndeveloped which aim to reduce running time while maintaining accurate\nclassification.

We use standard plasma diagnostics (e.g. [O III] and [N\nII] line ratios and the H$\\beta$ line fluxes) to constrain electron densities\nand temperatures. Using Monte Carlo modeling of the ejecta, we derive the\nstructure and filling factor from comparisons to the optical and ultraviolet\nline profiles. The ejecta can be modeled using an axisymmetric conical --\nbipolar -- geometry with a low inclination of the axis to the line of sight,\ni=15+/-5 degrees, compatible with published results from high angular\nresolution optical spectro-interferometry. The structure is similar to that\nobserved in the other short orbital period recurrent novae during their nebular\nstages. We show that the electron density scales as $t^{-3}$ as expected from a\nballistically ejected constant mass shell; there is no need to invoke a\ncontinuing mass outflow following the eruption. The derived mass for the ejecta\nwith filling factor f ~ 3%, M_ej ~ 2E-6$M_sun is similar to that obtained for\nother recurrent nova ejecta but inconsistent with the previously reported\nextended optically thick epoch of the explosion. We suggest that the system\nunderwent a common envelope phase following the explosion that produced the\nrecombination event. Implications for the dynamics of the recurrent novae are\ndiscussed.

However, the likelihood of autocatalytic sets\nemerging spontaneously has long been debated. Recently, progress has been made\nalong two different lines. Experimental results have shown that autocatalytic\nsets can indeed emerge in real chemical systems, and theoretical work has shown\nthat the existence of such self-sustaining sets is highly likely in formal\nmodels of chemical systems. Here, we take a first step towards merging these\ntwo lines of work by constructing and investigating a formal model of a real\nchemical system of RNA replicators exhibiting autocatalytic sets.\n  Results: We show that the formal model accurately reproduces recent\nexperimental results on an RNA replicator system, in particular how the system\ngoes through a sequence of larger and larger autocatalytic sets, and how a\ncooperative (autocatalytic) system can outcompete an equivalent selfish system.\nMoreover, the model provides additional insights that could not be obtained\nfrom experiments alone, and it suggests several experimentally testable\nhypotheses.\n  Conclusions: Given these additional insights and predictions, the modeling\nframework provides a better and more detailed understanding of the nature of\nchemical systems in general and the emergence of autocatalytic sets in\nparticular. This provides an important first step in combining experimental and\ntheoretical work on autocatalytic sets in the context of the orgin of life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 01:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}

To overcome this problem, in\nthis paper we proposed a new CPD method which converts the original $N$th\n($N>3$) order tensor to a 3rd-order tensor first. Then the full CPD is realized\nby decomposing this mode reduced tensor followed by a Khatri-Rao product\nprojection procedure. This way is quite efficient as unfolding to each of the\n$N$ modes are avoided, and dimensionality reduction can also be easily\nincorporated to further improve the efficiency. We show that, under mild\nconditions, any $N$th-order CPD can be converted into a 3rd-order case but\nwithout destroying the essential uniqueness, and theoretically gives the same\nresults as direct $N$-way CPD methods.

Mathematically, a shape can be modeled as an\nun-parameterized immersed sub-manifold, which is the notion of shape used here.\nEndowing shape space with a Riemannian metric opens up the world of Riemannian\ndifferential geometry with geodesics, gradient flows and curvature.\nUnfortunately, the simplest such metric induces vanishing path-length distance\non shape space. This discovery by Michor and Mumford was the starting point to\na quest for stronger, meaningful metrics that should be able to distinguish\nsalient features of the shapes. Sobolev metrics are a very promising approach\nto that. They come in two flavors: Outer metrics which are induced from metrics\non the diffeomorphism group of ambient space, and inner metrics which are\ndefined intrinsically to the shape. In this work, Sobolev inner metrics are\ndeveloped and treated in a very general setting. There are no restrictions on\nthe dimension of the immersed space or of the ambient space, and ambient space\nis not required to be flat. It is shown that the path-length distance induced\nby Sobolev inner metrics does not vanish. The geodesic equation and the\nconserved quantities arising from the symmetries are calculated, and\nwell-posedness of the geodesic equation is proven. Finally examples of\nnumerical solutions to the geodesic equation are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 07:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}

As an application, a regularity result\nfor the Poincar\\'e Lemma is presented.\n  At the beginning, the definitions of a subriemannian geometry, horizontal\nvector fields and horizontal curves are given. Then the question arises: Can\nany two points be connected by a horizontal curve? Chow's Theorem gives an\naffirmative answer for bracket generating distributions. (A distribution is\ncalled bracket generating if horizontal vector fields and their iterated Lie\nbrackets span the whole tangent space.)\n  We present three different proofs of Chow's Theorem; each one is interesting\nin its own. The first proof is based on the theory of Stefan and Sussmann\nregarding integrability of singular distributions. The second proof is\nelementary and gives some insight in the shape of subriemannian balls. The\nthird proof is based on infinite dimensional analysis of the endpoint map.\n  Finally, the study of the endpoint map allows us to prove a regularity result\nfor the Poincar\\'e Lemma in a form suited to subriemannian geometry: If for\nsome $r \\geq 0$ all horizontal derivatives of a given function $f$ are known to\nbe $r$ times continuously differentiable, then so is $f$.\n  Sections 1 to 3 are the common work of Martin Bauer and Philipp Harms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 08:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}

We present APEX\n12CO(6-5), (7-6), 13CO(6-5), (8-7) and HIFI 13CO(10-9) maps of the star forming\nregion G327.36-0.6. We infer the physical properties of the emitting gas on\nlarge scales through a LTE analysis, while we apply a more sophisticated LVG\napproach on selected positions. Maps of all lines are dominated in intensity by\nthe PDR around the Hii region G327.3-0.5. Mid-J 12CO emission is detected over\nthe whole extent of the maps with excitation temperatures ranging from 20K up\nto 80K in the gas around the Hii region, and H2 column densities from few 10^21\ncm-2 in the inter-clump gas to 3 10^22 cm-2 towards the hot core G327.3-0.6.\nThe warm gas (traced by 12 and 13CO(6-5) emission) is only a small percentage\n(10%) of the total gas in the IRDC, while it reaches values up to 35% of the\ntotal gas in the ring surrounding the Hii region. The 12CO ladders are\nqualitatively compatible with PDR models for high density gas, but the much\nweaker than predicted 13CO emission suggests that it comes from a large number\nof clumps along the line of sight. All lines are detected in the inter-clump\ngas when averaged over a large region with an equivalent radius of 50\"\n(~0.8pc), implying that the mid-J 12CO and 13CO inter-clump emission is due to\nhigh density components with low filling factor. Finally, the detection of the\n13CO(10-9) line allows to disentangle the effects of gas temperature and gas\ndensity on the CO emission, which are degenerate in the APEX observations\nalone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 10:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We investigate two approaches\nto optimize the parameters of spike-and-slab sparse coding: a novel truncated\nEM approach and, for comparison, an approach based on standard factored\nvariational distributions. The truncated approach can be regarded as a\nvariational approach with truncated posteriors as variational distributions. In\napplications to source separation we find that both approaches improve the\nstate-of-the-art in a number of standard benchmarks, which argues for the use\nof `spike-and-slab' priors for the corresponding data domains. Furthermore, we\nfind that the truncated EM approach improves on the standard factored approach\nin source separation tasks$-$which hints to biases introduced by assuming\nposterior independence in the factored variational approach. Likewise, on a\nstandard benchmark for image denoising, we find that the truncated EM approach\nimproves on the factored variational approach. While the performance of the\nfactored approach saturates with increasing numbers of hidden dimensions, the\nperformance of the truncated approach improves the state-of-the-art for higher\nnoise levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 12:34:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2013 11:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 09:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

That is, the existence of an edge\nbetween two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this paper, we\nconsider a graph $G = (V,E)$. We wish to perform an inference task -- the\ninference task considered here is \"vertex classification\". However, we do not\nobserve $G$; rather, for each potential edge $uv \\in {{V}\\choose{2}}$ we\nobserve an \"edge-feature\" which we use to classify $uv$ as edge/not-edge. Thus\nwe errorfully observe $G$ when we observe the graph $\\widetilde{G} =\n(V,\\widetilde{E})$ as the edges in $\\widetilde{E}$ arise from the\nclassifications of the \"edge-features\", and are expected to be errorful.\nMoreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge-features we\nobserve -- more informative edge-features are more expensive, and hence the\nnumber of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of\nthe edge-features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality\ntradeoff for a simple class of random graphs model, namely the stochastic\nblockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for\nclassifying $v$ and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for\nsubsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating\npoints for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the\nissue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize\nperformance for the ultimate inference task. Finally, we investigate the\nquantity/quality tradeoff for errorful obesrvations of the {\\it C.\\ elegans}\nconnectome graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 13:22:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2013 19:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2014 18:57:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 13:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

The theory is relatively insensitive to moderate amounts of\nenvironmental noise, wherein the location of the fitness maximum changes by\namounts of order the width of the noise-free distribution.

The activation\nof specific sensory-motor processes, which may partially replace impaired\nneural pathways, is likely the cause of the observed benefits. Nonlinear\nindexes, such as scaling exponents and Lyapunov exponents, have been proposed\nto characterize RAC effects. The maximal Lyapunov exponent estimates the degree\nof resilience of gait control to small perturbations, i.e. the local dynamic\nstability (LDS). The objective of the present study was to assess to what\nextent RAC influences gait LDS, and to compare this effect with that on scaling\nexponents. Twenty healthy subjects performed 6x5min walking trials on an\ninstrumented treadmill at three different speeds. Freely chosen walking\ncadences were measured during the first three trials and then imposed\naccordingly in the last three trials with a metronome. The 2D trajectory of the\ncenter of pressure on the treadmill was recorded. From the antero-posterior and\nthe medio-lateral signals, both long-term and short-term LDS were computed.\nLong-term LDS was strongly enhanced (relative change +47%), with significant\nchange in every direction and speed. The average change in short-term LDS was\nsmaller (+3%), with a more marked effect at low speed (+5%). RAC substantially\nmodified the fluctuation dynamics of the center of the pressure trajectory. We\nalso observed that both LDS and fractal dynamics (scaling exponents) responded\nsimilarly to RAC. Thus, both scaling exponents and LDS are responsive to\nsensory-motor synchronizing processes that RAC activates, and may constitute\nrelevant indexes for evaluating gait variability in cued walking. Finally, the\nmore locally stable gait pattern could be an indication of a lower fall risk,\nwhich may be an advantage to patients of RAC therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 14:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 10:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 08:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

Supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to be the primary candidates\nfor the sources of Galactic cosmic rays. According to the diffusive shock\nacceleration theory, SNR shocks produce a power-law spectrum with an index of s\n= 2, perhaps nonlinearly modified to harder spectra at high energy.\nObservations of SNRs often indicate particle spectra that are softer than that\nand show features not expected from classical theory. Known drawbacks of the\nstandard approach are the assumption that SNRs evolve in a uniform environment,\nand that the reverse shock does not accelerate particles. Relaxing these\nassumptions increases the complexity of the problem, because one needs reliable\nhydrodynamical data for the plasma flow as well as good estimates for the\nmagnetic field (MF) at the reverse shock. Aims. We show that these two factors\nare especially important when modeling young core-collapse SNRs that evolve in\na complicated circumstellar medium shaped by the winds of progenitor stars.\nMethods. We used high-resolution numerical simulations for the hydrodynamical\nevolution of the SNR. Instead of parametrizations of the MF profiles inside the\nSNR, we followed the advection of the frozen-in MF inside the SNR, and thus\nobtained the B-field value at all locations, in particular at the reverse\nshock. To model cosmic-ray acceleration we solved the cosmic-ray transport\nequation in test-particle approximation. Results. We find that the complex\nplasma-flow profiles of core-collapse SNRs significantly modify the particle\nspectra. Additionally, the reverse shock strongly affects the emission spectra\nand the surface brightness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 15:11:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 14:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

NGC 4921 shows a few but\nwell-defined dust arms midway to its centre while NGC 7049 displays many more\ndusty features, mainly collected within a ring-shaped formation. Numerous dark\nand filamentary structures, called outgrowths, are found to protrude from the\ndusty arms in both galaxies. The outgrowths point both outwards and inwards in\nthe galaxies. Mostly they are found to be V-shaped or Y-shaped with the\nbranches connected to dark arm filaments. Often the stem of the Y appears to\nconsist of intertwined filaments. Remarkably, the outgrowths show considerable\nsimilarities to elephant trunks in H II regions. A model of the outgrowths,\nbased on magnetized filaments, is proposed. The model provides explanations of\nboth the shapes and orientations of the outgrowths. Most important, it can also\ngive an account for their intertwined structures.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful sequence\nlearning architecture that has proven capable of learning such representations.\nHowever RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined alignment between the input\nand output sequences to perform transduction.

The crack\ndevelopment highlights the importance of voids which appear ahead of the crack\nas observed in experiments on the nano-scale. The appearance of these voids is\nresponsible for roughening the crack path on small scales, in agreement with\ntheoretical expectations. With increasing speed of propagation one observes the\nbranching instabilities that were reported in experiments. The simulations\nallow understanding the phenomena by analyzing the elastic stress field that\naccompanies the crack dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 14:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Self-consistent method was applied by solving coupled\nSchr\\\"odinger-Poisson equation taking wave function penetration and strain\neffects into account. Experimental I-V and gate leakage characteristic for\np-channel InxGa1-xSb MOSFETs are available in recent literature. However, a\nself- consistent simulation of C-V characterization and direct tunneling gate\nleakage current is yet to be done for both n- channel and p-channel InxGa1-xSb\nsurface channel MOSFETs. We studied the variation of C-V characteristics and\ngate leakage current with some important process parameters like oxide\nthickness, channel composition, channel thickness and temperature for n-channel\nMOSFET in this work. Device performance should improve as compressive strain\nincreases in channel. Our simulation results validate this phenomenon as\nballistic current increases and gate leakage current decreases with the\nincrease in compressive strain. We also compared the device performance by\nreplacing InxGa1-xSb with InxGa1-xAs in channel of the structure. Simulation\nresults show that performance is much better with this replacement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 17:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}
