Our frame- work includes\nseveral previously studied domains of asymptotics as special cases and allows\none to investigate interesting connections and transitions among the various\ndomains. More importantly, it enables us to investigate asymptotic scenarios\nthat have not been considered before, and gain new insights into the\nconsistency, subspace consistency and strong inconsistency regions of PCA and\nthe boundaries among them. We also establish the corresponding convergence rate\nwithin each region. Under general spike covariance models, the dimension (or\nthe number of variables) discourages the consistency of PCA, while the sample\nsize and spike information (the relative size of the population eigenvalues)\nencourages PCA consistency. Our framework nicely illustrates the relationship\namong these three types of information in terms of dimension, sample size and\nspike size, and rigorously characterizes how their relationships affect PCA\nconsistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 16:02:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2012 18:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 02:57:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 15:39:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2013 01:33:11 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2013 15:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

Let k denote a complete nonarchimedean valued field. We first\nprove a lower bound for the gonality of a curve over the algebraic closure of k\nin terms of the minimal degree of a class of graph maps, namely: one should\nminimize over all so-called finite harmonic graph morphisms to trees, that\noriginate from any refinement of the dual graph of the stable model of the\ncurve. Next comes our main result: we prove a lower bound for the degree of\nsuch a graph morphism in terms of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian and\nsome \"volume\" of the original graph; this can be seen as a substitute for\ngraphs of the Li-Yau inequality from differential geometry, although we also\nprove that the strict analogue of the original inequality fails for general\ngraphs.

We explore this\nrelationship in several directions. We start proving a formula which relates\nthe Lorentzian distance in the full spacetime with the least action of a\nmechanical system living in a quotient classical space time. The timelike\neikonal equation satisfied by the Lorentzian distance is proved to be\nequivalent to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the least action. We also prove\nthat the Legendre transform on the classical base corresponds to the musical\nisomorphism on the light cone, and the Young-Fenchel inequality is nothing but\na well known geometric inequality in Lorentzian geometry. A strategy to\nsimplify the dynamics passing to a reference frame moving with the E.-L. flow\nis explained. It is then proved that the causality properties can be\nconveniently expressed in terms of the least action. In particular, strong\ncausality coincides with stable causality and is equivalent to the lower\nsemi-continuity of the classical least action on the diagonal, while global\nhyperbolicity is equivalent to the coercivity condition on the action\nfunctional. The classical Tonelli's theorem in the calculus of variations\ncorresponds, then, to the well known result that global hyperbolicity implies\ncausal simplicity. The well known problem of recasting the metric in a global\nRosen form is shown to be equivalent to that of finding global solutions to the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation having complete characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 16:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

The formation of sdBs is still unclear as well as the\nchemical composition of their atmospheres. The observed helium depletion is\nattributed to atmospheric diffusion. Metal abundances have been determined for\nabout a dozen sdBs only resulting in puzzling patterns with enrichment of heavy\nmetals and depletion of lighter ones. Aims: In this paper we present a detailed\nmetal abundance analysis of 106 sdBs. Methods: From high resolution spectra we\nmeasured elemental abundances of up to 24 different ions per star. A\nsemi-automatic analysis pipeline was developed to calculate and fit LTE models\nto a standard set of spectral lines. Results: A general trend of enrichment was\nfound with increasing temperature for most of the heavier elements. The lighter\nelements like carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are depleted and less affected by\ntemperature. Although there is considerable scatter from star to star, the\ngeneral abundance patterns in most sdBs are similar. State-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels predict such patterns and are in qualitative agreement with our results.\nHowever, the highest enrichments measured cannot not be explained with these\nmodels. Peculiar line shapes of the strongest metal lines in some stars\nindicate vertical stratification to be present in the atmospheres. Such effects\nare not accounted for in current diffusion models and may be responsible for\nsome of the yet unexplained abundance anomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 16:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The\ncollision-induced absorption (CIA) of molecular hydrogen causes a clearly\ndefined blue turn-off along the WD (WDBTO) cooling sequences and a bright\nsecondary maximum in the WD LFs. These features are independent of age over a\nbroad age range and are minimally affected by metal abundance. This means that\nthe NIR magnitudes of the WDBTO are very promising distance indicators. The\ninterplay between the cooling time of progressively more massive WDs and the\nonset of CIA causes a red turn-off along the WD (WDRTO) cooling sequences and a\nwell defined faint peak in the WD LFs. These features are very sensitive to the\ncluster age, and indeed the K-band magnitude of the faint peak increases by\n0.2--0.25 mag/Gyr for ages between 10 and 14 Gyr. On the other hand, the faint\npeak in the optical WD LF increases in the same age range by 0.17 (V band) and\n0.15 (I band) mag/Gyr. Moreover, we also suggest to use the difference in\nmagnitude between the main sequence turn-off and either the WDBTO (optical) or\nthe WDRTO (NIR).

Logit dynamics is a decentralized algorithm in which a level of\nirrationality (a.k.a. \"noise\") is introduced in players' behavior. In this\ncontext, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium, as\nopposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy\nprofiles that possess several nice properties, including existence and\nuniqueness. However, there are games in which their computation may take time\nexponential in the number of players. We therefore look at an approximate\nversion of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by\nAuletta et al. [SODA 2012]. These are distributions that remain stable (i.e.,\nplayers do not go too far from it) for a super-polynomial number of steps\n(rather than forever, as for logit equilibria). The hope is that these\ndistributions exist and can be reached quickly by logit dynamics.\n  We identify a class of potential games, called asymptotically well-behaved,\nfor which the behavior of the logit dynamics is not chaotic as the number of\nplayers increases so to guarantee meaningful asymptotic results. We prove that\nany such game admits distributions which are metastable no matter the level of\nnoise present in the system, and the starting profile of the dynamics. These\ndistributions can be quickly reached if the rationality level is not too big\nwhen compared to the inverse of the maximum difference in potential.

If the tunneling coupling is weak, individual levels\nare resolved and the conductance $G(V)$ at small temperatures is composed of a\nset of resonant Lorentz peaks which cannot be described within perturbation\ntheory over tunnelling strength. We establish a general formula for their\nwidths and heights and show that the width of any peak scales as normal-state\ntunnel conductance, while its height is $\\lesssim 2e^2/h$ and depends only on\ncontact geometry and the spatial profile of the resonant Andreev level.

We use it to study the interference of\nAndreev reflection processes through different levels. The effect is most\npronounced at low voltages, where an Andreev level at $E_j$ and its conjugate\nat $-E_j$ interfere destructively. This interference leads to the quantization\nof the zero-bias conductance: G(0) equals $2e^2/h$ (or 0) if there is (there is\nnot) a Majorana fermion in the spectrum, in agreement with previous results\nfrom $S$-matrix theory. We also study $G(eV>0)$ for a system with a pair of\nalmost decoupled Majorana fermions with splitting $E_0$ and show that at lowest\n$E_0$ there is a zero-bias Lorentz peak of width $W$ as expected for a single\nMajorana fermion (a topological NS-junction) with a narrow dip of width\n$E_0^2/W$ at zero bias, which ensures $G(0)=0$ (the NS-junction remains trivial\non a very small energy scale). As the coupling $W$ gets stronger, the dip\nbecomes narrower, which can be understood as enhanced decoupling of the remote\nMajorana fermion.

Akin to the situation of heavy fermions, organic\nsuperconductors and pnictides, it has been proposed that the pairing mechanism\nin cuprates comes from fluctuations of a nearby quantum phase transition.\nRecent evidence of charge modulation and the associated fluctuations in the\npseudogap phase of YBa_2Cu_3O_y make charge order a likely candidate for a\ncompeting order. However, a thermodynamic signature of the charge ordering\nphase transition is still lacking. Moreover, whether such charge order is one-\nor two-dimensional is still controversial but pivotal for the understanding the\ntopology of the reconstructed Fermi surface. Here we address both issues by\nmeasuring sound velocities in YBCO_6.55 in high magnetic fields, a powerful\nthermodynamic probe to detect phase transitions. We provide the first\nthermodynamic signature of the field-induced charge ordering phase transition\nin YBCO allowing construction of a field-temperature phase diagram, which\nreveals the competing nature of this charge order. The comparison of different\nacoustic modes indicates that the charge modulation has a two-dimensional\ncharacter, thus imposing strong constraints on Fermi surface reconstruction\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 18:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

The globular cluster system of a galaxy is typically assumed to\nbe in dynamical equilibrium within the potential of the host galaxy. However\ncluster galaxies are subjected to a rapidly evolving and, at times, violently\ndestructive tidal field. We investigate the impact of the harassment on the\ndynamics of GCs surrounding early type cluster dwarfs, using numerical\nsimulations. We find that the dynamical behaviour of the GCS is strongly\ninfluenced by the fraction of bound dark matter f_{DM} remaining in the galaxy.\nOnly when f_{DM} falls to ~15%, do stars and GCs begin to be stripped. Still\nthe observed GC velocity dispersion can be used to measure the true enclosed\nmass to within a factor of 2, even when f_{DM} falls as low as ~3%. This is\npossible partly because unbound GCs quickly separate from the galaxy body.\nHowever even the distribution of {\\it{bound}} GCs may spatially expand by a\nfactor of 2-3. Once f_{DM} falls into the <3% regime, the galaxy is close to\ncomplete disruption, and GCS dynamics can no longer be used to reliably\nestimate the enclosed mass. In this regime, the remaining bound GCS may\nspatially expand by a factor of 4 to 8. It may be possible to test if a galaxy\nis in this regime by measuring the dynamics of the stellar disk.

We compare these data to\nanalogous measurements in metal-poor stars of the Galactic halo and to detailed\ncalculations of explosive nucleosynthesis in metal-free stars. We conclude that\nmost of the DLAs in our sample were enriched by stars that released an energy\nof < 1.2 x 10^51 erg when they exploded as core-collapse supernovae. Finally,\nwe discuss the exciting prospect of measuring Fe-peak element ratios in damped\nLyman-alpha systems with Fe/H < 1/1000 of solar when 30-m class telescopes\nbecome available. Only then will we be able to pin down the energy that was\nreleased by the supernovae of the first stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2013 18:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 23:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We can differentiate degenerate combinations of the\nbias parameters by combining results for the global ionization histories and\ncorrelation length between ionized regions.

In the standard model, we observe three fundamentally\ndifferent types of behavior: QCD is in a confined phase at zero temperature,\nwhile the electroweak sector of the standard model combines Coulomb and Higgs\nphases. Our current understanding of the phase structure of gauge theories owes\nmuch to the modern theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, but has\ndeveloped into a subject of extensive study. After reviewing some fundamental\nconcepts of phase transitions and finite-temperature gauge theories, we discuss\nsome recent work that broadly extends our knowledge of the mechanisms that\ndetermine the phase structure of gauge theories. A new class of models with a\nrich phase structure has been discovered, generalizing our understanding of the\nconfinement-deconfinement transition in finite-temperature gauge theories.\nModels in this class have space-time topologies with one or more compact\ndirections. On R^3 x S^1, the addition of double-trace deformations or periodic\nadjoint fermions to a gauge theory can yield a confined phase in the region\nwhere the S^1 circumference L is small, so that the coupling constant is small,\nand semiclassical methods are applicable. In this region, Euclidean monopole\nsolutions, which are constituents of finite-temperature instantons, play a\ncrucial role in the calculation of a non-perturbative string tension. We review\nthe techniques use to analyze this new class of models and the results obtained\nso far, as well as their application to finite-temperature phase structure,\nconformal phases of gauge theories and the large-N limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 21:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Processing the high dimensional data\nincurs a high computational cost and is inherently inefficient since many of\nthe values that describe a data object are redundant due to noise and inner\ncorrelations. Consequently, the dimensionality, i.e. the number of values that\nare used to describe a data object, needs to be reduced prior to any other\nprocessing of the data. The dimensionality reduction removes, in most cases,\nnoise from the data and reduces substantially the computational cost of\nalgorithms that are applied to the data.\n  In this thesis, a novel coherent integrated methodology is introduced\n(theory, algorithm and applications) to reduce the dimensionality of\nhigh-dimensional datasets. The method constructs a diffusion process among the\ndata coordinates via a random walk. The dimensionality reduction is obtained\nbased on the eigen-decomposition of the Markov matrix that is associated with\nthe random walk.

Most\nof the literature on host-pathogen coevolution focuses on this phenomenon, and\nlooks for consequent evidence of coevolutionary arms races. An alternative\nstrategy, less often considered in the literature, is to deter rapid\nevolutionary change by the opponent. To study how this can be done, we\nconstruct an evolutionary game between a controller that must process\ninformation, and an adversary that can tamper with this information processing.\nIn this game, a species can foil its antagonist by processing information in a\nway that is hard for the antagonist to manipulate. We show that the structure\nof the information processing system induces a fitness landscape on which the\nadversary population evolves. Complex processing logic can carve long, deep\nfitness valleys that slow adaptive evolution in the adversary population. We\nsuggest that this type of defensive complexity on the part of the vertebrate\nadaptive immune system may be an important element of coevolutionary dynamics\nbetween pathogens and their vertebrate hosts. Furthermore, we cite evidence\nthat the immune control logic is phylogenetically conserved in mammalian\nlineages. Thus our model of defensive complexity suggests a new hypothesis for\nthe lower rates of evolution for immune control logic compared to other immune\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 03:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-14"}

On the\none hand, outperforming many of the established pure continuous variable or\ndiscrete variable schemes, these hybrid approaches offer new opportunities.\nHowever, on the other hand, they also lead to new, intricate, as yet\nuninvestigated, phenomena.\n  An important ingredient of several of these hybrid protocols is a new kind of\nentanglement: The hybrid entanglement between continuous variable and discrete\nvariable quantum systems, which is studied in detail in this work. An\nexhaustive analysis of this kind of entanglement is performed, where the focus\nis on bipartite entanglement. Nevertheless, also issues regarding multipartite\nhybrid entanglement are briefly discussed. The quintessence of this thesis is a\nnew classification scheme which distinguishes between effective discrete\nvariable hybrid entanglement and so-called true hybrid entanglement. However,\nalong the way, also other questions are addressed, which have emerged during\nthe studies. For example, entanglement witnessing is discussed not only for\nhybrid entangled states, but also for fully continuous variable two-mode\nSchroedinger cat states. Furthermore, subtleties regarding entanglement\nwitnessing in a certain kind of mixed states are examined.

In this paper we establish the following\ndichotomy: either $P$ is a moderate asymmetric expander in the sense that\n$|P(A,B)| \\gg |\\F|$ whenever $A, B \\subset \\F$ are such that $|A| |B| \\geq C\n|\\F|^{2-1/8}$ for a sufficiently large $C$, or else $P$ takes the form $P(x,y)\n= Q(F(x)+G(y))$ or $P(x,y) = Q(F(x) G(y))$ for some polynomials $Q,F,G$. This\nis a reasonably satisfactory classification of polynomials of two variables\nthat moderately expand (either symmetrically or asymmetrically). We obtain a\nsimilar classification for weak expansion (in which one has $|P(A,A)| \\gg\n|A|^{1/2} |\\F|^{1/2}$ whenever $|A| \\geq C |\\F|^{1-1/16}$), and a partially\nsatisfactory classification for almost strong asymmetric expansion (in which\n$|P(A,B)| = (1-O(|\\F|^{-c})) |\\F|$ when $|A|, |B| \\geq |\\F|^{1-c}$ for some\nsmall absolute constant $c>0$).\n  The main new tool used to establish these results is an algebraic regularity\nlemma that describes the structure of dense graphs generated by definable\nsubsets over finite fields of large characteristic. This lemma strengthens the\nSz\\'emeredi regularity lemma in the algebraic case, in that while the latter\nlemma decomposes a graph into a bounded number of components, most of which are\n$\\eps$-regular for some small but fixed $\\epsilon$, the latter lemma ensures\nthat all of the components are $O(|\\F|^{-1/4})$-regular. This lemma, which may\nbe of independent interest, relies on some basic facts about the \\'etale\nfundamental group of an algebraic variety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 05:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 16:34:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 18:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 05:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-04"}

In this work, the\ncapacity gain achieved through CoMP transmission is studied in various models\nof wireless networks that have practical significance. The capacity gain is\nanalyzed through the degrees of freedom (DoF) criterion. The DoF available for\ncommunication provides an analytically tractable way to characterize the\ncapacity of interference channels. The considered channel model has K\ntransmitter/receiver pairs, and each receiver is interested in one unique\nmessage from a set of K independent messages. Each message can be available at\nmore than one transmitter. The maximum number of transmitters at which each\nmessage can be available, is defined as the cooperation order M. For fully\nconnected interference channels, it is shown that the asymptotic per user DoF,\nas K goes to infinity, remains at 1/2 as M is increased from 1 to 2.\nFurthermore, the same negative result is shown to hold for all M > 1 for any\nmessage assignment that satisfies a local cooperation constraint. On the other\nhand, when the assumption of full connectivity is relaxed to local\nconnectivity, and each transmitter is connected only to its own receiver as\nwell as L neighboring receivers, it is shown that local cooperation is optimal.\nThe asymptotic per user DoF is shown to be at least max {1/2,2M/(2M+L)} for\nlocally connected channels, and is shown to be 2M/(2M+1) for the special case\nof Wyner's asymmetric model where L=1. An interesting feature of the proposed\nachievability scheme is that it relies on simple zero-forcing transmit beams\nand does not require symbol extensions. Also, to achieve the optimal per user\nDoF for Wyner's model, messages are assigned to transmitters in an asymmetric\nfashion unlike traditional assignments where message i has to be available at\ntransmitter i.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 06:36:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2013 06:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-10"}

As a matter of fact the Li\\'enard-Weichert retarded potential leads to\na formula indistinguishable from the one obtained assuming that the electric\nfield propagates with infinite velocity. Feyman explanation for this apparent\nparadox was based on the fact that uniform motions last indefinitely.\n  To verify such an explanation, we performed an experiment to measure the\ntime/space evolution of the electric field generated by an uniformely moving\nelectron beam.

Firstly a loading\ndose is given, which is designed to bring the International Normalisation Ratio\n(INR) to within therapeutic range. Then a stable maintenance dose is given to\nmaintain the INR within therapeutic range. In the United Kingdom (UK) the\nloading dose is usually given as three individual daily doses, the standard\nloading dose being 10mg on days one and two and 5mgs on day three, which can be\nvaried at the discretion of the clinician. However, due to the large\ninter-individual variation in the response to Warfarin therapy, it is difficult\nto identify which patients will reach the narrow therapeutic window for target\nINR, and which will be above or below the therapeutic window. The aim of this\nresearch was to develop a methodology using a neural networks classification\nalgorithm and data mining techniques to predict for a given loading dose and\npatient characteristics if the patient is more likely to achieve target INR or\nmore likely to be above or below therapeutic range.\n  Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 10-fold stratified cross validation\nalgorithms were used to determine an artificial neural network to classify\npatients' response to their initial Warfarin loading dose. The resulting neural\nnetwork model correctly classifies an individual's response to their Warfarin\nloading dose over 80% of the time. As well as taking into account the initial\nloading dose, the final model also includes demographic, genetic and a number\nof other potential confounding factors. With this model clinicians can\npredetermine whether a given loading regimen, along with specific patient\ncharacteristics will achieve a therapeutic response for a particular patient.\nThus tailoring the loading dose regimen to meet the individual needs of the\npatient and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions associated with\nWarfarin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 10:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-14"}

The existence\nof misbehaving nodes may paralyze the routing operation in MANETs. To overcome\nthis behavior, the trustworthiness of the network nodes should be considered in\nthe route selection process combined with the hop count. The trustworthiness is\nachieved by measuring the trust value for each node in the network. In this\npaper, a new protocol based on self monitoring (agent-based) and following the\ndynamic source routing (DSR) algorithm is presented. This protocol is called\nAgent-Based Trusted Dynamic Source Routing (ATDSR) Protocol for MANETs. The\nobjective of this protocol is to manage trust information locally with minimal\noverhead in terms of extra messages and time delay. This objective is achieved\nthrough installing in each participated node in the network a multi-agent\nsystem (MAS). MAS consists of two types of agents: monitoring agent (MOA) and\nrouting agent (ROA). A new mathematical and more realistic objective model for\nmeasuring the trust value is introduced. This model is weighted by both number\nand size of routed packets to reflect the selective forwarding behavior of a\nnode. The performance evaluation via simulation shows that our protocol is\nbetter than standard and trusted DSR. The simulation is done over a variety of\nenvironmental conditions such as number of malicious nodes, host density and\nmovement rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 10:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 16:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-18"}

There has\nbeen many efforts to extend stable model semantics so that answer set programs\ncan use a more extensive syntax. To such endeavor, the community of\nnon-monotonic reasoning has introduced extensions such as equilibrium models\nand FLP semantics. However, both of these extensions suffer from two problems:\nintended models according to such extensions (1) are not guaranteed to be\nminimal, and (2) more importantly, may have self-justifications (i.e., the\njustification for pertinence of an atom in an intended model may be its own\npertinence). Both of these properties directly violate the spirit of stable\nmodel semantics. Therefore, we believe that we need a new extension of stable\nmodel semantics that guarantees both minimality and being strongly grounded.\n  This paper introduces one such extension using two different approaches:\nfirstly, by extending the goal-reachability interpretation of logic programs to\nthe full propositional language and, secondly, using derivability in\nintuitionistic propositional logic. We show that both these approaches give the\nsame semantics, that we call the supported semantics. Moreover, using the first\napproach, we also extend well-founded semantics to full propositional language.\nFurthermore, we discuss how our supported models relate to other existing\nsemantics for non-monotonic reasoning including the equilibrium models. Last,\nbut not the least, we discuss the complexity of reasoning about supported\nmodels and show that all interesting reasoning tasks (such as brave/cautious\nreasoning) are PSPACE-complete.

Additionally, the\nalgorithm presented avoids the need for calculating midpoints, doesn't require\nadditional entry/exit flags, and avoids changing the vertex data structure used\nin the original Greiner-Hormann algorithm, which was required by the extension\npresented by Kim et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 22:21:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 04:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}
