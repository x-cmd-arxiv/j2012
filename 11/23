The\nclassification criteria are defined by the data and the algorithm, with no\nprior physical framework. We work with a representative set of stellar spectra\nassociated with the SDSS SEGUE and SEGUE-2 programs. We classify the original\nspectra as well as the spectra with the continuum removed. The second set only\ncontains spectral lines, and it is less dependent on uncertainties of the flux\ncalibration. The classification of the spectra with continuum renders 16 major\nclasses. Roughly speaking, stars are split according to their colors, with\nenough finesse to distinguish dwarfs from giants of the same effective\ntemperature, but with difficulties to separate stars with different\nmetallicities. Overall, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the\nclasses we derive and the MK types. The classification of spectra without\ncontinuum renders 13 classes, the color separation is not so sharp, but it\ndistinguishes stars of the same effective temperature and different\nmetallicities. Some classes thus obtained present a fairly small range of\nphysical parameters (200 K in effective temperature, 0.25 dex in surface\ngravity, and 0.35 dex in metallicity), so that the classification can be used\nto estimate the main physical parameters of some stars at a minimum\ncomputational cost. We also analyze the outliers of the classification. Most of\nthem turn out to be failures of the reduction pipeline, but there are also high\nredshift QSOs, multiple stellar systems, dust-reddened stars, galaxies, and,\nfinally, odd spectra whose nature we have not decipher. The template spectra\nrepresentative of the classes are publicly available\n(ftp://stars:kmeans@ftp.iac.es).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 16:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

If the jet\none-sidedness is due to relativistic beaming the depolarization asymmetry must\nbe due to an intervening Faraday screen. If it is intrinsic the depolarization\nasymmetry must be related to internal differences in the lobes. We assume in\nthis paper that the speed in the outer jet of several Fanaroff-Riley Class 1\n(FRI) sources exhibiting the L-G effect is close to the 0.1c reported by\nseveral other investigators.

Although it is not known if the flow in the outer\njets of FRII sources also slows to this speed it is suggested that the\nexplanation of the L-G effect is likely to be the same in both types. This\nargument is strengthened by the recent evidence that FRII galaxies have very\nlarge viewing angles, which in turn implies that the L-G model cannot work\nregardless of the jet velocity.

Is the difference between MCs\nand ICMEs without detected flux rope intrinsic or rather due to an\nobservational bias? As the spacecraft has no relationship with the MC\ntrajectory, the frequency distribution of MCs versus the spacecraft distance to\nthe MCs axis is expected to be approximately flat. However, Lepping and Wu\n(2010) confirmed that it is a strongly decreasing function of the estimated\nimpact parameter. Is a flux rope more frequently undetected for larger impact\nparameter? In order to answer the questions above, we explore the parameter\nspace of flux rope models, especially the aspect ratio, boundary shape, and\ncurrent distribution. The proposed models are analyzed as MCs by fitting a\ncircular linear force-free field to the magnetic field computed along simulated\ncrossings.\n  We find that the distribution of the twist within the flux rope, the\nnon-detection due to too low field rotation angle or magnitude are only weakly\naffecting the expected frequency distribution of MCs versus impact parameter.\nHowever, the estimated impact parameter is increasingly biased to lower values\nas the flux-rope cross section is more elongated orthogonally to the crossing\ntrajectory. The observed distribution of MCs is a natural consequence of a\nflux-rope cross section flattened in average by a factor 2 to 3 depending on\nthe magnetic twist profile. However, the faster MCs at 1 AU, with V>550 km/s,\npresent an almost uniform distribution of MCs vs. impact parameter, which is\nconsistent with round shaped flux ropes, in contrast with the slower ones. We\nconclude that either most of the non-MC ICMEs are encountered outside their\nflux rope or near the leg region, or they do not contain any.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 17:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this work, we propose a methodology to measure the magnitude\nof Cobb angle, which appreciably reduces the variability related to its\nmeasurement compared to the related works. The proposed methodology is\nfacilitated by using a suitable new improved version of Non-Local Means for\nimage denoisation and Otsus automatic threshold selection for Canny edge\ndetection.

We test and confirm their empirical relationship using a\nfifth source, H1743-322, whose spin was recently measured. We show that this\nrelationship is consistent with Fe-line spin measurements provided that the\nblack hole spin axis is assumed to be aligned with the binary angular momentum\naxis. We also show that, during a major outburst of a black hole transient, the\nsystem reasonably approximates an X-ray standard candle. We further show, using\nthe standard synchrotron bubble model, that the radio luminosity at light-curve\nmaximum is a good proxy for jet kinetic energy. Thus, the observed tight\ncorrelation between radio power and black hole spin indicates a strong\nunderlying link between mechanical jet power and black hole spin. Using the\nfitted correlation between radio power and spin for the above five calibration\nsources, we predict the spins of six other black holes in X-ray/radio transient\nsystems with low-mass companions. Remarkably, these predicted spins are all\nrelatively low, especially when compared to the high measured spins of black\nholes in persistent, wind-fed systems with massive companions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 21:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 20:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We confirmed\nthat the spiral arms are formed due to a swing amplification mechanism that\nreinforces density enhancement as a seeded wake. In the damping phase, the\nCoriolis force exerted on a portion of the arm surpasses the gravitational\nforce that acts to shrink the portion. Consequently, the stars in the portion\nescape from the arm, and subsequently they form a new arm at a different\nlocation. The time-dependent nature of the spiral arms are originated in the\ncontinual repetition of this non-linear phenomenon. Since a spiral arm does not\nrigidly rotate, but follows the galactic differential rotation, the stars in\nthe arm rotate at almost the same rate as the arm. In other words, every single\nposition in the arm can be regarded as the co-rotation point. Due to\ninteraction with their host arms, the energy and angular momentum of the stars\nchange, thereby causing the radial migration of the stars. During this process,\nthe kinetic energy of random motion (random energy) of the stars does not\nsignificantly increase, and the disk remains dynamically cold. Owing to this\nlow degree of disk heating, the short-lived spiral arms can recurrently develop\nover many rotational periods. The resultant structure of the spiral arms in the\n$N$-body simulations is consistent with some observational nature of spiral\ngalaxies. We conclude that the formation and structure of spiral arms in\nisolated disk galaxies can be reasonably understood by non-linear interactions\nbetween a spiral arm and its constituent stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 01:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A truncated boundary allowing for a satisfactory accuracy of the\nnumerical solution has to be determined by trial and errors and this seems to\nbe the weakest point of the classical approach. On the other hand, the free\nboundary approach overcomes the need for a priori definition of the truncated\nboundary. In fact, in a free boundary formulation the unknown free boundary can\nbe identified with a truncated boundary and being unknown it has to be found as\npart of the solution.

The most striking one is the Gott spacetime. Two\ncosmic strings, approaching each other with high velocity, could produce closed\ntimelike curves. It was quickly recognized that this solution violates physical\nboundary conditions. The effective one particle generator becomes hyperbolic,\nso the center of mass is tachyonic. On a 5-dimensional warped spacetime, it\nseems possible to get an elliptic generator, so no obstruction is encountered\nand the velocity of the center of mass of the effective particle has an overlap\nwith the Gott region.

Current researchers have\nproposed several measures or algorithms, such as betweenness, PageRank and HITS\netc., to identify the node importance. However, these measures are based on\ndifferent aspects of properties of nodes, and often conflict with the others. A\nreasonable, fair standard is needed for evaluating and comparing these\nalgorithms. This paper develops a framework as the standard for ranking the\nimportance of nodes. Four intuitive rules are suggested to measure the node\nimportance, and the equivalence classes approach is employed to resolve the\nconflicts and aggregate the results of the rules. To quantitatively compare the\nalgorithms, the performance indicators are also proposed based on a similarity\nmeasure. Three widely used real-world networks are used as the test-beds. The\nexperimental results illustrate the feasibility of this framework and show that\nboth algorithms, PageRank and HITS, perform well with bias when dealing with\nthe tested networks.

It is known that the biased expected effect of a random letter-change\non the optimal score implies an order of fluctuation linear in $\\sqrt{n}$.\nHowever, in many situations where such a biased effect is observed empirically,\nit has been impossible to prove analytically. The main result of this paper\nshows that when the rescaled-limit of the optimal alignment score increases in\na certain direction, then the biased effect exists. On the basis of this result\none can quantify a confidence level for the existence of such a biased effect\nand hence of an order $\\sqrt{n}$ fluctuation based on simulation of optimal\nalignments scores.This is an important step forward, as the correct order of\nfluctuation was previously known only for certain special distributions. To\nillustrate the usefulness of our new methodology, we apply it to optimal\nalignments of strings written in the DNA-alphabet. As scoring function, we use\nthe BLASTZ default-substitution matrix together with a realistic gap penalty.\nBLASTZ is one of the most widely used sequence alignment methodologies in\nbioinformatics. For this DNA-setting, we show that with a high level of\nconfidence, the fluctuation of the optimal alignment score is of order\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$. An important special case of optimal alignment score is the\nLongest Common Subsequence (LCS) of random strings. For binary sequences with\nequiprobable symbols, the question of the fluctuation of the LCS remains open.\nThe symmetry in that case does not allow for our method. On the other hand, in\nreal-life DNA sequences, it is not the case that all letters occur with the\nsame frequency. Thus, for many real life situations, our method allows to\ndetermine the order of the fluctuation up to a high confidence level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 12:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-26"}

From collinear spin polarized calculations\nwe find that DFT+U_Eff predicts a gapless ferromagnet in contrast with\nexperiment which indicates an insulating antiferromagnet. The inclusion of\nanisotropic Coulomb and exchange interactions in the DFT+U approach, defining U\nand J explicitly, corrects these errors and leads to an antiferromagnetic\nground state with a fundamental gap of 0.8 eV consistent with low temperature\nexperiments. To our knowledge, this work on \\beta-MnO2 represents the first\ndemonstration of a case in which the application of fully anisotropic\ninteractions in DFT+U determines the magnetic order and consequent band gap,\nwhile the more commonly used effective U approach fails. Such effects are\nargued to be of importance in many insulating materials.

Magnetic coupling constants obtained by the fitting of a\nHeisenberg spin Hamiltonian to the energies of a range of magnetic states\nassist in rationalizing the finding that anisotropic interactions enhance the\nstability of the experimentally observed helical antiferromagnetic order.

Here we propose a novel\nmethod for the demarcation of the linker based on a three-dimensional protein\nstructure and a domain definition.

Excitation of far-infrared and submillimetric molecular lines may\noriginate from nonreactive collisions, chemical formation, or far infrared,\nnear-infrared, and optical fluorescences. As a template, we investigate the\nimpact of each of these processes on the excitation of the methylidyne cation\nCH+ and on the intensities of its rotational transitions recently detected in\nemission in dense photodissociation regions (PDRs) and in planetary nebulae.\nMethods. We have developed a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE)\nexcitation model that includes the entire energy structure of CH+, i.e. taking\ninto account the pumping of its vibrational and bound and unbound electronic\nstates by near-infrared and optical photons. The model includes the theoretical\ncross-sections of nonreactive collisions with H, H2, He, and e-, and a\nBoltzmann distribution is used to describe the probability of populating the\nexcited levels of CH+ during its chemical formation by hydrogenation of C+. To\nconfirm our results we also performed an extensive analytical study, which we\nuse to predict the main excitation process of several diatomic molecules,\nnamely HF, HCl, SiO, CS, and CO. Results. At densities nH = 10^4 cm-3, the\nexcitation of the rotational levels of CH+ is dominated by the radiative\npumping of its electronic, vibrational, and rotational states if the\nintensities of the radiation field at \\sim 0.4, \\sim 4, and \\sim 300 \\mum are\nstronger than 10^5, 10^8, and 10^4 times those of the local interstellar\nradiation field (ISRF). Below these values, the chemical pumping is the\ndominant source of excitation of the J > 1 levels, even at high kinetic\ntemperatures (\\sim 1000 K).

The theoretical\nconsideration is based on the so-called velocity Langevin (V-Langevin) equation\nwhich determines the progress of the translocation in terms of the number of\npolymer segments, $s(t)$, that have passed through the pore at time $t$ due to\na driving force $f$. The formalism is based only on the assumption that, due to\nthermal fluctuations, the translocation velocity $v=\\dot{s}(t)$ is a Gaussian\nrandom process as suggested by our MD data. With this in mind we have derived\nthe corresponding Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) which has a nonlinear drift term\nand diffusion term with a {\\em time-dependent} diffusion coefficient $D(t)$.\nOur MD simulation reveals that the driven translocation process follows a {\\em\nsuper}diffusive law with a running diffusion coefficient $D(t) \\propto\nt^{\\gamma}$ where $\\gamma < 1$. This finding is then used in the numerical\nsolution of the FPE which yields an important result: for comparatively small\ndriving forces fluctuations facilitate the translocation dynamics. As a\nconsequence, the exponent $\\alpha$ which describes the scaling of the mean\ntranslocation time $<\\tau>$ with the length $N$ of the polymer, $<\\tau> \\propto\nN^{\\alpha}$ is found to diminish. Thus, taking thermal fluctuations into\naccount, one can explain the systematic discrepancy between theoretically\npredicted duration of a driven translocation process, considered usually as a\ndeterministic event, and measurements in computer simulations.
