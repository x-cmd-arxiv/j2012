Unlike M, this matrix is\nsuitable to describe anisotropy in cortical magnification, which is of\nparticular interest in the highly gyrified human cerebral cortex. The advantage\nof our tensor method over other surface-based 3D methods to explore cortical\nmorphometry is that M expresses cortical quantities in the corresponding\nsensory space. It allows us to investigate the spatial relation between sensory\nfunction and anatomical structure. To this end, we consider the calcarine\nsulcus (CS) as an anatomical landmark for the primary visual cortex (V1). We\nfound that a stereotypically formed 3D model of V1 compared to a flat model\nexplains an excess of cortical tissue for the representation of visual\ninformation coming from the horizon of the visual field. This suggests that the\nintrinsic geometry of this sulcus is adapted to encephalize a particular\nfunction along the horizon. Since visual functions are assumed to be M-scaled,\ncortical folding can serve as an anatomical basis for increased functionality\non the horizon similar to a retinal specialization known as visual streak,\nwhich is found in animals with lower encephalization. Thus, the gain of surface\narea by cortical folding links anatomical structure to cortical function in a\npreviously unrecognized way, which may guide sulci development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2012 17:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-01"}

All this information is essential for understanding\nthe energetic particle acceleration that we discuss further in the review. For\ninstance, we show how fast and slow modes accelerate energetic particles\nthrough the second order Fermi acceleration, while density fluctuations\ngenerate magnetic fields in pre-shock regions enabling the first order Fermi\nacceleration of high energy cosmic rays. Very importantly, however, the first\norder Fermi cosmic ray acceleration is also possible in sites of magnetic\nreconnection. In the presence of turbulence this reconnection gets fast and we\npresent numerical evidence supporting the predictions of the Lazarian &\nVishniac (1999) model of fast reconnection. The efficiency of this process\nsuggests that magnetic reconnection can release substantial amounts of energy\nin short periods of time. As the particle tracing numerical simulations show\nthat the particles can be efficiently accelerated during the reconnection, we\nargue that the process of magnetic reconnection may be much more important for\nparticle acceleration than it is currently accepted.

They are\nthought to correspond to early formative stages of disk galaxies. On the other\nhand, halo objects, such as old globular clusters and halo stars, are likely to\nconsist of the oldest stars in a galaxy (age>10 Gyr), therefore the clumpy disk\nformation can be presumed to take place in a pre-existing halo system. Aims:\nGiant clumps are orbiting in the same direction in a premature disk and so\nmassive that they may be expected to interact gravitationally with halo objects\nand exercise influence on kinematic state of the halo. Accordingly, I\nscrutinize the possibility that the clumps leave a kinematic imprint of the\nclumpy disk formation on a halo system. Methods: I perform a restricted N-body\ncalculation with a toy-model to study the kinematic influence on a halo by\norbital motions of clumps, examine dependence of the results on masses\n(mass-loss), number and orbital radii of the clumps. Results: I will show that\nhalo objects can catch clump motions and acquire disky rotation in a dynamical\nfriction time-scale of the clumps, ~0.5 Gyr. The influence of clumps is limited\nwithin a region around the disk, the halo system shows vertical gradients of\nnet rotation velocity and orbital eccentricity. The significance of the\nkinematic influence strongly depends on the clump masses, the lower limit of\npostulated clump mass would be 5x10^8 solar masses. The result depends also on\nwhether the clumps are subjected to rapid mass-loss or not, which is an open\nquestion under debate in recent studies. The existence of such massive clumps\nis not unrealistic, I therefore suggest that there could remain the imprints of\npast clumpy disk formation in current galactic halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 01:32:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 07:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The distribution of spacetime defects is constructed\nto be Lorentz-invariant. It does not introduce a preferred reference frame,\nbecause it is based on a sprinkling process. A field-theoretic action for the\nphoton and a fermion is set up, in which the photon is assumed not to couple to\nthe defects directly, but via a scalar field. We are interested in signs for\nLorentz violation caused by the spacetime defects, which are expected to reveal\nthemselves in the photon sector.

In many\nproblems, the pseudo-true parameter corresponds to a population parameter of\ninterest, and so a misspecified model can provide consistent estimation for\nthis parameter. Furthermore, the well-known sandwich variance formula of\nHuber(1967) provides an asymptotically accurate sampling distribution for the\nMLE, even under model misspecification. However, confidence intervals based on\na sandwich variance estimate may behave poorly for low sample sizes, partly due\nto the use of a plug-in estimate of the variance. From a Bayesian perspective,\nplug-in estimates of nuisance parameters generally underrepresent uncertainty\nin the unknown parameters, and averaging over such parameters is expected to\ngive better performance. With this in mind, we present a Bayesian sandwich\nposterior distribution, whose likelihood is based on the sandwich sampling\ndistribution of the MLE. This Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of\nprior information about the parameter of interest, averages over uncertainty in\nthe nuisance parameter and is asymptotically robust to model misspecification.\nIn a small simulation study on estimating a regression parameter under\nheteroscedasticity, the addition of accurate prior information and the\naveraging over the nuisance parameter are both seen to improve the accuracy and\ncalibration of confidence intervals for the parameter of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 04:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-02"}

Particular attention is paid to the separation\nof the momentum distributions into the mean-field and short-range correlations\n(SRC) contributions. It is shown that at high values of the momentum $k$ the\nhigh-momentum components ($k\\gtrsim 1.5-2$ fm$^{-1}$) of all nuclei considered\nare very similar, exhibiting the well-known scaling behavior with the mass\nnumber $A$, independently of the used many-body approach and the details of the\nbare $NN$ interaction.

In this paper we study the emerging paradigm of sampling and\nreconstructing spatial fields using sensors that move through space. We show\nthat mobile sensing offers some unique advantages over static sensing in\nsensing time-invariant bandlimited spatial fields. Since a moving sensor\nencounters such a spatial field along its path as a time-domain signal, a\ntime-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed prior to sampling the signal\nreceived at the sensor. Such a filtering procedure, when used by a\nconfiguration of sensors moving at constant speeds along equispaced parallel\nlines, leads to a complete suppression of spatial aliasing in the direction of\nmotion of the sensors. We analytically quantify the advantage of using such a\nsampling scheme over a static sampling scheme by computing the reduction in\nsampling noise due to the filter. We also analyze the effects of non-uniform\nsensor speeds on the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulation examples we\ndemonstrate the advantages of mobile sampling over static sampling in practical\nproblems.\n  We extend our analysis to sampling and reconstruction schemes for monitoring\ntime-varying bandlimited fields using mobile sensors. We demonstrate that in\nsome situations we require a lower density of sensors when using a mobile\nsensing scheme instead of the conventional static sensing scheme.

More recently than 100Myr, there has been a burst of SF at a\nrate ~2-3 times higher than the average SFR. The inferred recent SFR from CMD\nmodelling is higher than inferred from the Ha flux of the galaxy; we interpret\nthis to mean that the upper end of the IMF is not being fully sampled due to\nthe low SFR.
