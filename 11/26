Specifically,\nin this paper, identical (except for their speeds) mobile agents are placed at\narbitrary locations on a cycle of length $n$ and use their speed difference in\norder to rendezvous fast. We normalize the speed of the slower agent to be 1,\nand fix the speed of the faster agent to be some $c>1$. (An agent does not know\nwhether it is the slower agent or the faster one.) The straightforward\ndistributed-race DR algorithm is the one in which both agents simply start\nwalking until rendezvous is achieved. It is easy to show that, in the worst\ncase, the rendezvous time of DR is $n/(c-1)$. Note that in the interesting\ncase, where $c$ is very close to 1 this bound becomes huge. Our first result is\na lower bound showing that, up to a multiplicative factor of 2, this bound is\nunavoidable, even in a model that allows agents to leave arbitrary marks, even\nassuming sense of direction, and even assuming $n$ and $c$ are known to agents.\nThat is, we show that under such assumptions, the rendezvous time of any\nalgorithm is at least $\\frac{n}{2(c-1)}$ if $c\\leq 3$ and slightly larger if\n$c>3$. We then construct an algorithm that precisely matches the lower bound\nfor the case $c\\leq 2$, and almost matches it when $c>2$. Moreover, our\nalgorithm performs under weaker assumptions than those stated above, as it does\nnot assume sense of direction, and it allows agents to leave only a single mark\n(a pebble) and only at the place where they start the execution. Finally, we\ninvestigate the setting in which no marks can be used at all, and show tight\nbounds for $c\\leq 2$, and almost tight bounds for $c>2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2015 16:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

The\ncommunity labels for the nodes are unknown and it is of major interest to\nestimate them (i.e., community detection). Degree Corrected Block Model (DCBM)\nis a popular network model. How to detect communities with the DCBM is an\ninteresting problem, where the main challenge lies in the degree heterogeneity.\nWe propose a new approach to community detection which we call the Spectral\nClustering On Ratios-of-Eigenvectors (SCORE). Compared to classical spectral\nmethods, the main innovation is to use the entry-wise ratios between the first\nleading eigenvector and each of the other leading eigenvectors for clustering.\nLet $A$ be the adjacency matrix of the network. We first obtain the $K$ leading\neigenvectors of $A$, say, $\\hat{\\eta}_1,\\ldots,\\hat{\\eta}_K$, and let $\\hat{R}$\nbe the $n\\times (K-1)$ matrix such that\n$\\hat{R}(i,k)=\\hat{\\eta}_{k+1}(i)/\\hat{\\eta}_1(i)$, $1\\leq i\\leq n$, $1\\leq\nk\\leq K-1$. We then use $\\hat{R}$ for clustering by applying the $k$-means\nmethod. The central surprise is, the effect of degree heterogeneity is largely\nancillary, and can be effectively removed by taking entry-wise ratios between\n$\\hat{\\eta}_{k+1}$ and $\\hat{\\eta}_1$, $1\\leq k\\leq K-1$. The method is\nsuccessfully applied to the web blogs data and the karate club data, with error\nrates of $58/1222$ and $1/34$, respectively.

The\nluminosity function of the stars can also be inferred even when the precise\nluminosity of each star is uncertain, via the use of a hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel. The computational feasibility of the method is demonstrated on two\nsimulated images with different numbers of stars. We find that our method\nsuccessfully recovers the input parameter values along with principled\nuncertainties even when the field is crowded. We also compare our results with\nthose obtained from the SExtractor software. While the two approaches largely\nagree about the fluxes of the bright stars, the Bayesian approach provides more\naccurate inferences about the faint stars and the number of stars, particularly\nin the crowded case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 20:52:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 21:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This is especially established for a class of stripped\nenvelope supernovae (SNe IIb/Ib/Ic) where a combination of high shock velocity\nand low circumstellar material (CSM) density makes it easier to derive the\nintrinsic energy distribution than in other classes of SNe.

An expected\nresult of the Planck data analysis is the distinction of the various\ncontaminants of the CMB signal. Among these contaminants is the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, which is caused by the inverse Compton\nscattering of CMB photons by high energy electrons in the intracluster medium\nof galaxy clusters. We modify a public version of the JADE (Joint Approximate\nDiagonalization of Eigenmatrices) algorithm, to deal with noisy data, and then\nuse this algorithm as a tool to search for SZ clusters in two simulated\ndatasets. The first dataset is composed of simple \"homemade\" simulations and\nthe second of full sky simulations of high angular resolution, available at the\nLAMBDA (Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis) website. The\nprocess of component separation can be summarized in four main steps: (1)\npre-processing based on wavelet analysis, which performs an initial cleaning\n(denoising) of data to minimize the noise level; (2) the separation of the\ncomponents by JADE; (3) the calibration of the recovered SZ map; and (4) the\nidentification of the positions and intensities of the clusters using the\nSExtractor software.

The\noutflow floods through the inter-cloud channels, sweeps up the hot ISM, and\nablates and disperses the dense clouds. The momentum of the UFO is primarily\ntransferred to the dense clouds via the ram pressure in the channel flow, and\nthe wind-blown bubble evolves in the energy-driven regime. Any dependence on\nUFO opening angle disappears after the first interaction with obstructing\nclouds. On kpc scales, therefore, feedback by UFOs operates similarly to\nfeedback by relativistic AGN jets.

Because the\nabsorption cross section of neutral hydrogen decreases sharply with photon\nenergy (proportional to the inverse cube), X-rays can escape more freely than\nUV photons from the star-forming regions in which they are produced, allowing\nHMXBs to make a potentially significant contribution to the ionizing X-ray\nbackground during reionization. In this paper, we explore the ionizing power of\nHMXBs at redshifts z > 6 using a Monte Carlo model for a coeval stellar\npopulation of main sequence stars and HMXBs. Using the archetypal Galactic HMXB\nCygnus X-1 as our template, we propose a composite HMXB spectral energy\ndistribution consisting of black-body and power-law components, whose\ncontributions depend on the accretion state of the system.

Since the novel techniques require\nextra payload resources, fairness issues in the comparison among the two\napproaches arise. The present contribution evaluates in a fair manner, the\nperformance of the return link (RL) of a SatCom system serving mobile users\nthat are jointly decoded at the receiver. More specifically, the achievable\nspectral efficiency of the assumed system is compared to a conventional system\nunder the constraint of equal physical layer resource utilization. Furthermore,\nrealistic link budgets for the RL of mobile SatComs are presented, thus\nallowing the comparison of the systems in terms of achievable throughput. Since\nthe proposed systems operate under the same payload requirements as the\nconventional systems, the comparison can be regarded as fair. Finally, existing\nanalytical formulas are also employed to provide closed form descriptions of\nthe performance of clustered multibeam MUD, thus introducing insights on how\nthe performance scales with respect to the system parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 08:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

At a typical observing wavelength, this\ndelay can vary by tens of microseconds on five-year time scales, far in excess\nof signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays, such as that induced by a\ngravitational-wave background. Measurement of these delay variations is not\nonly crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides an\nunparallelled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at au scales. In\nthis paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength- independent\nred-noise, 'simple' algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion can\nattenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. We present a robust\nmethod for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply it\nto observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Correction for dispersion\nvariations comes at a cost of increased band-limited white noise. We discuss\nscheduling to minimise this additional noise, and factors, such as\nscintillation, that can exacerbate the problem. Comparison with scintillation\nmeasurements confirms previous results that the spectral exponent of electron\ndensity variations in the interstellar medium often appears steeper than\nexpected. We also find a discrete change in dispersion measure of PSR\nJ1603-7202 of ~2x10^{-3} cm^{-3}pc for about 250 days.

To this end,\nthe topic of dual satellite systems, in which satellites share spatial (i.e.\nsame coverage area) and spectral (i.e. full frequency reuse) degrees of freedom\nis introduced. In each multibeam satellite, multiuser interferences are\nmitigated by employing zero forcing precoding with realistic per antenna power\nconstraints. However, the two sets of users that the transmitters are\nseparately serving, interfere. The present contribution, proposes the partial\ncooperation, namely coordination between the two coexisting transmitters in\norder to reduce interferences and enhance the performance of the whole system,\nwhile maintaining moderate system complexity. In this direction, a heuristic,\niterative, low complexity algorithm that allocates users in the two interfering\nsets is proposed.

The first is achieved by\nmaximizing the orthogonality between users allocated in the same set, hence\noptimizing the zero forcing performance, whilst the second by minimizing the\nlevel of interferences between the two sets.

The resulting ejecta are\nchemically stratified, have the same mass and roughly the same asymptotic\nkinetic energy, but exhibit a range in 56Ni mass. We investigate the\ncontemporaneous photometric and spectroscopic properties of a sequence of\ndelayed-detonation models, characterized by 56Ni masses between 0.18 and 0.81\nMsun. Starting at 1d after explosion, we perform the full non-LTE,\ntime-dependent radiative transfer with the code CMFGEN, with an accurate\ntreatment of line blanketing, and compare our results to SNe Ia at bolometric\nmaximum. Despite the 1D treatment, our approach delivers an excellent agreement\nto observations. We recover the range of SN Ia luminosities, colours, and\nspectral characteristics from the near-UV to 1 micron, for standard as well as\nlow-luminosity 91bg-like SNe Ia. Our models predict an increase in rise time to\npeak with increasing 56Ni mass, from ~15 to ~21d, yield peak bolometric\nluminosities that match Arnett's rule to within 10%, and reproduce the much\nsmaller scatter in near-IR magnitudes compared to the optical.

Finally, we examine recent,\nrelevant experimental measurements and outline future prospects to improve our\nunderstanding of these unique environments from observational, theoretical and\nexperimental perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 09:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

The broad aim is to investigate whether simple flows of model\ngranular matter exhibits spontaneous oscillatory motion in generic flow\nconditions, and in this case, whether the frictional properties of the contacts\nbetween grains may affect the existence or the characteristics of this\noscillatory motion. The analysis of different series of simulations show that\nthe flow develops an oscillatory motion with a well-defined frequency which\nincreases like the inverse of the velocity's square root. We show that the\noscillation is essentially a surface phenomena. The amplitude of the\noscillation is higher for lower volume fractions, and can thus be related to\nthe flow velocity and grains friction properties. The study of the influence of\nthe periodic geometry of the simulation cell shows no significant effect.

To better understand the spread of various products\nthrough a social network arXiv:1105.2434 introduced a threshold model, in which\nthe nodes influenced by their neighbours can adopt one out of several\nalternatives. To analyze the consequences of such product adoption we associate\nhere with each such social network a natural strategic game between the agents.\n  In these games the payoff of each player weakly increases when more players\nchoose his strategy, which is exactly opposite to the congestion games. The\npossibility of not choosing any product results in two special types of (pure)\nNash equilibria.\n  We show that such games may have no Nash equilibrium and that determining an\nexistence of a Nash equilibrium, also of a special type, is NP-complete. This\nimplies the same result for a more general class of games, namely polymatrix\ngames. The situation changes when the underlying graph of the social network is\na DAG, a simple cycle, or, more generally, has no source nodes.

In agreement with\nmagnetic extrapolations, we find that the flows are thin, fan-like structures\nrooted in quasi separatrix layers (QSLs). The fans are tilted away from the AR\ncentre. The highest plasma velocities in these three spectral lines have\nsimilar magnitudes and their heights increase with temperature.

The optical characteristics of TCOs have been studied to evaluate\nthe functionalities and potential of these materials as metal substitutes in\nplasmonic and MM devices, even apart from their usual use as electrode\nmaterials. However, patterning TCOs at the nanoscale, which is necessary for\nplasmonic and MM devices, is not well-studied. This paper investigates\nnanopatterning processes for TCOs, especially the lift-off technique with\nelectron-beam lithography, and the realization of plasmonic nanostructures with\nTCOs. By employing the developed nanopatterning process, we fabricate\n2D-periodic arrays of TCO nanodisks and characterize the material's plasmonic\nproperties to evaluate the performance of TCOs as metal substitutes.\nLight-induced collective oscillations of the free electrons in the TCOs (bulk\nplasmons) and localized surface plasmon resonances are observed in the\nwavelength range from 1.6 to 2.1 micron. Well-defined resonance peaks are\nobserved, which can be dramatically tuned by varying the amount of dopant and\nby thermally annealing the TCO nanodisks in nitrogen gas ambient while\nmaintaining the low-loss properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 15:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

Here, we present ongoing work on the data\nanalysis for both the event reconstruction (energy, direction) and gamma/hadron\nseparation, carried out within the HAP (H.E.S.S. Analysis Package) software\nframework of the H.E.S.S. collaboration, for this initial study. The event\nreconstruction uses both Hillas-parameter-based algorithms and an improved\nversion of the 3D-Model algorithm. For the gamma/hadron discrimination,\noriginal and robust discriminant variables are used and treated with Boosted\nDecision Trees (BDTs) in the TMVA (Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis)\nframework. With this advanced analysis, known as Paris-MVA, the sensitivity is\nimproved by a factor of about 2 in the core range of CTA relative to the\nstandard analyses. Here we present the algorithms used for the reconstruction\nand discrimination, together with the resulting performance characteristics,\nwith good confidence, since the method has been successfully applied for\nH.E.S.S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 15:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Recently, it has been extended by Pham and\nVenkatesh to cope with the case where corruption to the CS data is modeled as\nimpulsive noise. The new formulation, termed as robust CS, combines robust\nstatistics and CS into a single framework to suppress outliers in the CS\nrecovery. To solve the newly formulated robust CS problem, Pham and Venkatesh\nsuggested a scheme that iteratively solves a number of CS problems, the\nsolutions from which converge to the true robust compressed sensing solution.\nHowever, this scheme is rather inefficient as it has to use existing CS solvers\nas a proxy. To overcome limitation with the original robust CS algorithm, we\npropose to solve the robust CS problem directly in this paper and drive more\ncomputationally efficient algorithms by following latest advances in\nlarge-scale convex optimization for non-smooth regularization. Furthermore, we\nalso extend the robust CS formulation to various settings, including additional\naffine constraints, $\\ell_1$-norm loss function, mixed-norm regularization, and\nmulti-tasking, so as to further improve robust CS. We also derive simple but\neffective algorithms to solve these extensions. We demonstrate that the new\nalgorithms provide much better computational advantage over the original robust\nCS formulation, and effectively solve more sophisticated extensions where the\noriginal methods simply cannot. We demonstrate the usefulness of the extensions\non several CS imaging tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 15:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-03"}
