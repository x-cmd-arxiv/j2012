The six major flares\noccurred near the main magnetic neutral lines of four active regions, NOAA\n11158, 11166, 11283 and 11429. During all six flares the neutral line field\nvectors became stronger and more horizontal, in each case almost entirely due\nto strengthening of the horizontal field components parallel to the neutral\nline. In all six cases the neutral line pre-flare fields were more vertical\nthan the reference potential fields, and collapsed abruptly and permanently\ncloser to potential field tilt angles during every flare, implying that the\nrelaxation of magnetic stress associated with non-potential tilt angles plays a\nmajor role during major flares. The shear angle with respect to the reference\npotential field did not show such a pattern, demonstrating that flare processes\ndo not generally relieve magnetic stresses associated with photospheric\nmagnetic shear. The horizontal fields became significantly and permanently more\naligned with the neutral line during the four largest flares, suggesting that\nthe collapsing field is on average more aligned with the neutral line than the\npre-flare neutral line field. The vertical Lorentz force had a large, abrupt,\npermanent downward change during each of the flares, consistent with loop\ncollapse. The horizontal Lorentz force changes acted mostly parallel to the\nneutral line in opposite directions on each side, a signature of the fields\ncontracting during the flare, pulling the two sides of the neutral line towards\neach other. The greater effect of the flares on field tilt than on shear may be\nexplained by photospheric line-tying.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 18:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-12"}

These properties are\na consequence of their weak interactions within a nearly linear medium. To\ncreate and manipulate nonclassical states of light, however, one requires a\nstrong, nonlinear interaction at the single photon level. One approach to\ngenerate suitable interactions is to couple photons to atoms, as in the strong\ncoupling regime of cavity QED systems. In these systems, however, one only\nindirectly controls the quantum state of the light by manipulating the atoms. A\ndirect photon-photon interaction occurs in so-called Kerr media, which\ntypically induce only weak nonlinearity at the cost of significant loss. So\nfar, it has not been possible to reach the single-photon Kerr regime, where the\ninteraction strength between individual photons exceeds the loss rate. Here,\nusing a 3D circuit QED architecture, we engineer an artificial Kerr medium\nwhich enters this regime and allows the observation of new quantum effects. We\nrealize a Gedankenexperiment proposed by Yurke and Stoler, in which the\ncollapse and revival of a coherent state can be observed. This time evolution\nis a consequence of the quantization of the light field in the cavity and the\nnonlinear interaction between individual photons. During this evolution\nnon-classical superpositions of coherent states, i.e. multi-component\nSchroedinger cat states, are formed. We visualize this evolution by measuring\nthe Husimi Q-function and confirm the non-classical properties of these\ntransient states by Wigner tomography.

We analyzed the CO emission lines (J_up = 14-46) in the\nPACS spectra, extracted within a projected distance of <= 2000 AU centered on\nthe protostar. The total luminosity of the CO lines observed with PACS (L(CO))\nis found to increase with increasing L_bol.

The\nrotational temperature components are remarkably invariant between protostars\nand show no dependence on L_bol, T_bol or envelope density, implying that if\nthe emitting gas is in LTE, the CO emission must arise in multiple temperature\ncomponents that remain independent of L_bol over two orders of magnitudes.

Based on 123 eclipse timings\ncalculated from the Wilson-Devinney binary model, a period study of the close\nbinary reveals that the orbital period has experienced a sinusoidal variation\nwith a period and a semi-amplitude of 205$\\pm$2 d and 0.0021$\\pm$0.0002 d,\nrespectively. The period variation would be produced by the light-travel-time\neffect due to a gravitationally-bound third body with a minimum mass of $M_3\n\\sin i_3$=0.76 M$_\\odot$ in an eccentric orbit of $e_3$=0.61. This is\nconsistent with the presence of third light found in our light-curve solution\nand the tertiary signal of 204.2 d period most likely arises from the K-type\nstar crossed by the close eclipsing binary. Then, KIC002856960 is a triply\neclipsing hierarchical system, A(BC), consisting of a close binary with two\nM-type dwarfs and a more massive K-type component. The presence of the third\nstar may have played an important role in the formation and evolution of the\nclose pair, which may ultimately evolve into a contact system by angular\nmomentum loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 22:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Transit detection\ndepends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host\nstar properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not\naccurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected\nusing criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,\ncombined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties\nof transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the\nKepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius\ndistribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%\noverestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler\ntarget catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and\nunderestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,\nespecially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are\nsmaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more\nmetal-poor than the target average. Fourth, uncertainties in stellar radii\nproduce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation. A previous\nfinding, that highly-irradiated giant are more likely to have \"inflated\" radii,\nremains significant, even accounting for this effect. In contrast, transit\ndepth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of\nany intrinsic correlation, and a previous claim of a negative correlation\nbetween giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an\nartifact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2012 01:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this paper we provide a detailed\nasymptotic analysis of large average submatrices of an $n \\times n$ Gaussian\nrandom matrix. The first part of the paper addresses global maxima. For fixed\n$k$ we identify the average and the joint distribution of the $k \\times k$\nsubmatrix having largest average value. As a dual result, we establish that the\nsize of the largest square sub-matrix with average bigger than a fixed positive\nconstant is, with high probability, equal to one of two consecutive integers\nthat depend on the threshold and the matrix dimension $n$. The second part of\nthe paper addresses local maxima. Specifically we consider submatrices with\ndominant row and column sums that arise as the local optima of iterative search\nprocedures for large average submatrices. For fixed $k$, we identify the\nlimiting average value and joint distribution of a $k \\times k$ submatrix\nconditioned to be a local maxima. In order to understand the density of such\nlocal optima and explain the quick convergence of such iterative procedures, we\nanalyze the number $L_n(k)$ of local maxima, beginning with exact asymptotic\nexpressions for the mean and fluctuation behavior of $L_n(k)$.

Combining both shared memory and message passing\nparallelizations within the same application, the hybrid MPI-OpenMP paradigm is\nan emerging trend for parallel programming to fully exploit distributed\nshared-memory architecture. In this paper, we improve the performance of MPEG-2\nencoder and n-body simulation by employing the hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming\nparadigm on SMP clusters. The hierarchical image data structure of the MPEG\nbit-stream is eminently suitable for the hybrid model to achieve multiple\nlevels of parallelism: MPI for parallelism at the group of pictures level\nacross SMP nodes and OpenMP for parallelism within pictures at the slice level\nwithin each SMP node. Similarly, the work load of the force calculation which\naccounts for upwards of 90% of the cycles in typical computations in the n-body\nsimulation is shared among OpenMP threads after ORB domain decomposition among\nMPI processes.

The few methods that take biological pathways\nor networks into account are either restricted to investigating a limited\nnumber of predetermined sets of loci, or do not scale to genome-wide settings.\n  We present SConES, a new efficient method to discover sets of genetic loci\nthat are maximally associated with a phenotype, while being connected in an\nunderlying network.

Increasing the mesh size tends to average out the intensity in\nthe direction of the mean of the stationary process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2012 15:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

We provide a procedure to identify multiple sources of an\noutbreak or their closer neighbors. Our methodology is based on a simple\nspectral technique requiring only the knowledge of the undirected contact\ngraph. The algorithm is tested on a variety of graphs collected from outbreaks\nincluding fluency, H5N1, Tbc, in urban and rural areas. Results show that the\nspectral technique is able to identify the source nodes if the graph\napproximates a tree sufficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2012 15:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

Accordingly, it\nis intentionally informal and conversational in tone to teach students how to\nbuild an intuition to complement mathematical formalism. This is accomplished\nby beginning with common and everyday experience and then guiding students\ntoward two realizations: (i) That real objects are deformable even when\ndeformations are not easily visible, and (ii) that the relation between\nfriction and normal forces follows from the action-reaction principle. The\ntraditional formulae under static and kinetic conditions are then analyzed to\nshow that peculiarity of the normal-friction relationship follows readily from\nobservations and knowledge of physics principles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2012 04:46:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-26"}

The wings, via a weight enhanced Tutte's barycentric embedding of a\nplanar map, produce the unexpected reformutation of a 3-dimensionl problem into\na 2-dimensional one. The total number of edges in each one of the pair of final\nwings is less than $8n-5$. Tutte's method is applied O(n) times to each one of\nthe 2 wings in the final pair to assure rectilinearity of the embeddings of the\nplanar maps, which include the final wings. A cone construction over the final\nwings provides a PL-complex $\\mathcal{H}_1^\\diamond$, which contain the set of\n0-simplices $\\{a_1, a_2,...,a_f\\} \\cup \\{b_1, b_2,...,b_g\\}$ (as defined in the\nsecond part of the article) properly fixed in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The other\n0-simplices are obtained by bisections of segments linking previously defined\npoints. This implies that $\\mathcal{H}_n$ is PL-embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nWe then conclude the surgery description of the 3-manifold induced by the gem\nwith its resolution by defining some disjoint cylinders contained in\n$\\mathcal{H}_{n}^\\star$, directly from the hinges (dual of the twistors of the\nresolution), in a 1-1 correspondence. The medial curves of the cylinders define\nthe link we seek. The framing of a medial curve is the linking number of the\nboundary components of the corresponding cylinder. The analysis of the whole\nproccess shows that the memory and time requirement to complete the algorithm\nis O(n^2). Data for the Weber-Seifert 3-manifold, which answers Jeffrey Weeks's\nquestion is given in the appendix. It consists of a link with 142 crossings but\nit admits simplifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 19:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 18:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 04:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}
