An objective method for\nsemi-empirical definition of spectral features sensitive to various physical\nparameters is applied to the spectra. It is based on sensitivity map--i.e.,\nderivative of the flux in the spectra with respect to the stellar parameters at\na fixed wavelength. New optimized indices are defined and their equivalent\nwidths (EWs) are measured. A number of sensitive features to the effective\ntemperature and surface gravity are re-identified or newly identified clearly\nshowing the reliability of the sensitivity map analysis. The sensitivity map\nallows to identify the best bandpass limits for the line and nearby continuum.\nIt reliably predicts the trends of spectral features with respect to a given\nphysical parameter but not their absolute strengths. Line blends are easy to\nrecognize when blended features have different behavior with respect to some\nphysical stellar parameter. The use of sensitivity map is therefore\ncomplementary to the use of indices. We give the EWs of the new indices\nmeasured for the IRTF star sample.

Recent work on stellar dynamics has demonstrated that there\nseems to be a complot in phase space acting on low-eccentricity captures, since\ntheir rates decrease significantly by the presence of a blockade in the rate at\nwhich orbital angular momenta change takes place. This so-called \"Schwarzschild\nbarrier\" is a result of the impact of relativistic precession on to the stellar\npotential torques, and thus it affects the enhancement on lower-eccentricity\nEMRIs that one would expect from resonant relaxation. We confirm and quantify\nthe existence of this barrier using a statistical sample of 2,500\ndirect-summation N-body simulations using both a post-Newtonian and also for\nthe first time in a direct-summation code a geodesic approximation for the\nrelativistic orbits. The existence of the barrier prevents low-eccentricity\nEMRIs from approaching the central MBH, but high-eccentricity EMRIs, which have\nbeen wrongly classified as \"direct plunges\" until recently, ignore the presence\nof the barrier, because they are driven by two-body relaxation. Hence, since\nthe rates are significantly affected in the case of low-eccentricity EMRIs, we\npredict that a LISA-like observatory such as eLISA will predominantly detect\nhigh-eccentricity EMRIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N. In the light of the above observations, we are in a position to state that\nto this date no case has come to light indicative of the failure of the LT\nunder the conditions for which it has been deduced.

We observe the\nrestriction of the solutions to a measurable subset $\\omega$ of $\\Omega$ during\na time interval [0,T] with T>0. We address the problem of the optimal location\nof the observation subset \\omega among all possible subsets of a given measure\nor volume fraction. We solve it in two different situations. First, when a\nspecific choice of the initial data is given and therefore we deal with a\nparticular solution, we show that the problem always admits at least one\nsolution that can be regular or of fractal type depending on the regularity of\nthe initial data. We then introduce a relevant criterion, not depending on the\ninitial conditions and to choose the observation set in an uniform way,\nindependent of the data and solutions under consideration. Through spectral\ndecompositions, this leads to a second problem which consists of maximizing a\nspectral functional that can be viewed as a measure of eigenfunction\nconcentration. This spectral criterion can be interpreted in two ways: it\ncorresponds either to a time asymptotic observability constant as the\nobservation time interval tends to infinity, or to a randomized version of the\ndeterministic observability inequality. Under appropriate quantum ergodicity\nassumptions on $\\Omega$, we compute the optimal value. We then provide spectral\napproximations and present some numerical simulations that fully confirm the\ntheoretical results in the paper and support our conjectures. Our results\nhighlight precise connections between optimal observability issues and quantum\nergodic properties of the domain under consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2012 10:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}
