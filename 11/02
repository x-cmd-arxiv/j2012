We develop a general framework that incorporates\nimperfections and losses in all stages of the process: before, during, and\nafter subtraction. By combining all three effects into a single efficiency\nparameter, we provide analytical and numerical results for subtraction\nstrategies using photon-number-resolving and threshold detectors. We compare\nthe entanglement gain afforded by symmetric and asymmetric subtraction\nscenarios across the two modes. For a given amount of loss, we identify an\noptimised set of parameters, such as initial squeezing and subtraction beam\nsplitter transmissivity, that maximise the entanglement gain rate. We identify\nregimes for which asymmetric subtraction of different Fock states on the two\nmodes outperforms symmetric strategies. In the lossless limit, subtracting a\nsingle photon from one mode always produces the highest entanglement gain rate.\nIn the lossy case, the optimal strategy depends strongly on the losses on each\nmode individually, such that there is no general optimal strategy.

We present a new weighted LD statistic that\ncan be used to infer mixture proportions as well as dates with fewer\nconstraints on reference populations than previous methods. We define an\nLD-based three-population test for admixture and identify scenarios in which it\ncan detect admixture events that previous formal tests cannot. We further show\nthat we can uncover phylogenetic relationships among populations by comparing\nweighted LD curves obtained using a suite of references. Finally, we describe\nseveral improvements to the computation and fitting of weighted LD curves that\ngreatly increase the robustness and speed of the calculations. We implement all\nof these advances in a software package, ALDER, which we validate in\nsimulations and apply to test for admixture among all populations from the\nHuman Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), highlighting insights into the admixture\nhistory of Central African Pygmies, Sardinians, and Japanese.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 18:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2013 18:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}

The results are compared\nwith equivalent calculations for a model of a typical atomic liquid, the\nLennard-Jones (LJ) potential, and with predictions for hydrophobic solvation in\nwater using the cavity equation of state and the extended simple point charge\n(SPC/E) model.

In particular, for both the\nJagla liquid and water, we observe temperature-dependent enthalpy and entropy\nof solvation for all solute sizes as well as a negative solvation entropy for\nsufficiently small solutes at low temperature.

In particular, we\nidentify two distinct populations of magnetic stars with Halpha emission:\nnamely, slowly rotating O-type stars with narrow emission consistent with a DM,\nand more rapidly rotating B-type stars with broader emission associated with a\nCM. For O-type stars, the high mass-loss rates are sufficient to accumulate\nenough material for line emission even within the relatively short free-fall\ntimescale associated with a DM: this high mass-loss rate also leads to a rapid\nmagnetic spindown of the stellar rotation. For the B-type stars, the longer\nconfinement of a CM is required to accumulate sufficient emitting material from\ntheir relatively weak winds, which also lead to much longer spindown\ntimescales.

We improve on\nprevious estimates by adding the dependence on system parameters, and noting\nthat the nonlinear nature of warp propagation in a thin viscous disc affects\nalignment. This reduces the disc's ability to communicate the warp, and can\nseverely reduce the effectiveness of disc-assisted spin alignment. We test our\npredictions with a Monte Carlo realization of random misalignments and\naccretion rates and we find that the outcome depends strongly on the spin\nmagnitude. We estimate a generous upper limit to the probability of alignment\nby making assumptions which favour it throughout. Even with these assumptions,\nabout 40% of black holes with $a \\gtrsim 0.5$ do not have time to align with\nthe disc. If the residual misalignment is not small and it is maintained down\nto the final coalescence phase this can give a powerful recoil velocity to the\nmerged hole. Highly spinning black holes are thus more likely of being subject\nto strong recoils, the occurrence of which is currently debated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

The Electroweak parameter\nDelta r relating the values of the gauge boson masses [MW,MZ] and the Fermi\nconstant [G_F] is the traditional observable encoding high precision\ninformation of the electroweak physics at the quantum level. In this work we\npresent a complete quantitative study of Delta r in the framework of the\ngeneral (unconstrained) Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). First of all we report\non a systematic analysis of Delta r at the full one loop level in the general\n2HDM, which to our knowledge was missing in the literature. Thereby we extract\na theoretical prediction for the mass of the W-boson in this model, taking MZ,\n\\alpha_{em} and G_F as experimental inputs. We find typical corrections leading\nto mass shifts $\\delta MW \\sim 20-40 MeV$ which help to improve the agreement\nwith the experimentally measured value, in a degree no less significant than in\nthe MSSM case. In the second part of our study we extend our calculation beyond\nthe mere one-loop order. We devise an effective Lagrangian approach that\ncaptures the dominant higher order quantum effects on delta rho (viz. that part\nof Delta r describing the breaking of the approximate SU(2) custodial symmetry)\nin the limit of large Higgs boson self-interactions. This limit constitutes a\ntelltale property of the general 2HDM which is unmatched by e.g. the MSSM. Our\nconclusion is that the Electroweak precision program to be conducted at the\nLHC, and maybe at a future linear collider, can nicely complement the direct\nsearches. Should these distinctive loop effects be eventually found they would\nsignal a smoking gun hinting at non-standard Higgs physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 21:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 09:55:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 12:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Radial velocity\nmeasurements for the main-sequence stars in three of our newly identified\neclipsing systems imply that their white dwarf masses are lower than those\ninferred from modelling their SDSS spectra. 13 non-eclipsing post common\nenvelope binaries were also identified, from either reflection or ellipsoidal\nmodulation effects. The white dwarfs in our newly discovered eclipsing systems\nspan a wide range of parameters, including; low mass (~0.3Msol), very hot\n(80,000K) and a DC white dwarf. The spectral types of the main-sequence stars\nrange from M2 to M6. This makes our sample ideal for testing white dwarf and\nlow-mass star mass-radius relationships as well as close binary evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 21:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

For sufficient coverage of the traffic\nstream, it is important to maintain a reasonable penetration rate of probe\nvehicles. From the standpoint of capturing higher-order traffic quantities such\nas acceleration/deceleration, emission and fuel consumption rates, it is\ndesirable to examine the impact on the estimation accuracy of sampling\nfrequency on vehicle position. Of the two issues raised above, the latter is\nrarely studied in the literature. This paper addresses the impact of both\nsampling frequency and penetration rate on mobile sensing of highway traffic.\nTo capture inhomogeneous driving conditions and deviation of traffic from the\nequilibrium state, we employ the second-order phase transition model (PTM).\nSeveral data fusion schemes that incorporate vehicle trajectory data into the\nPTM are proposed. And, a case study of the NGSIM dataset is presented which\nshows the estimation results of various Eulerian and Lagrangian traffic\nquantities. The findings show that while first-order traffic quantities can be\naccurately estimated even with a low sampling frequency, higher-order traffic\nquantities, such as acceleration, deviation, and emission rate, tend to be\nmisinterpreted due to insufficiently sampled vehicle locations. We also show\nthat a correction factor approach has the potential to reduce the sensing error\narising from low sampling frequency and penetration rate, making the estimation\nof higher-order quantities more robust against insufficient data coverage of\nthe highway traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 22:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 20:35:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 00:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2016 09:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

Globally, miRNAs directly repress the pluripotent core factors during\ndifferentiation state.

The decreasing methylation repressed by miRNAs in turn activates\nthe top miRNAs and pluripotent core factors, creating an active circuit system\nto modulate pluripotency. MiRNAs vary their functions with different stem cell\nstates.

The\nimportance of this result is two-fold: (i) fibre bundle spectrographs are able\nto identify low-surface brightness emission arising from extranuclear activity;\n(ii) such activity may be more common than presently assumed because\nconventional multi-object spectrographs use single-aperture fibres and spectra\nfrom these are nearly always dominated by nuclear emission. These early results\ndemonstrate the extraordinary potential of multi-object hexabundle spectroscopy\nin future galaxy surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 02:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Based on a\nbroad sample of 20 galaxies observed with Chandra we detected overdensity of\nX-ray sources in their outskirts. The overdensity appears as halos of resolved\nsources around the galaxies. These halos are broader than the stellar light,\nextending out to at least ~ 10 Re (Re is the effective radius). These halos are\ncomposed of sources fainter than ~5E38 erg/s, whereas the more luminous sources\nappear to follow the distribution of the stellar light, suggesting that the\nexcess source population consists of neutron star binaries. Dividing the galaxy\nsample into four groups according to their stellar mass and specific frequency\nof globular clusters, we find that the extended halos are present in all groups\nexcept for the low-mass galaxies with low globular cluster content.

The use of\ntubes in astronomical observation is later reported by Alhazen in his treatise\non optics (1011-1021). The description of pointing to the celestial pole\nindicates that the instrument must be accurately aligned with the true pole,\nmaterialized at that epoch by a star of fifth magnitude, at the limit of naked\neye visibility, and then the instrument must remain fixed. Solstices and\nEquinoxes are points of the orbit of the Sun, so the sphere could be used as a\ntool for observing the Sun and probably determine the duration of the tropical\nyear. This sphere was much more than a didactic tool, given the long procedure\nfor the accurate alignement.

By combining\na focused review of published results with new analysis and illustrations, we\nseek to build up an intuition regarding the situations when existing approaches\nwork, when they fail, and how new approaches can be tailored to specific\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 14:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-05"}

For ground based\nobservations, polarimetric precision is severely limited by the presence of\nEarth's atmosphere. Atmospheric turbulence (seeing) produces signal\nfluctuations which combined with the non-simultaneous nature of the measurement\nprocess cause intermixing of the Stokes parameters known as seeing induced\npolarization cross-talk.

However, in those studies the effect of higher\norder image aberrations than those corrected by the AO system was not taken\ninto account. We present in this paper an analysis of seeing induced cross-talk\nin the presence of higher order image aberrations through numerical simulation.\nIn this analysis we find that the amount of cross-talk among Stokes parameters\nis practically independent of the degree of image aberration corrected by an AO\nsystem.

Our data reveal HI absorption towards the\nradio continuum of the HII region, and HI emission arising from the Orion Bar\nphoton-dominated region (PDR) and from the Orion-KL outflow. In the Orion Bar\nPDR, the HI signal peaks in the same layer as the H2 near-infrared vibrational\nline emission, in agreement with models of the photodissociation of H2. The gas\ntemperature in this region is approximately 540K, and the HI abundance in the\ninterclump gas in the PDR is 5-10% of the available hydrogen nuclei. Most of\nthe gas in this region therefore remains molecular. Mechanical feedback on the\nVeil manifests itself through the interaction of ionized flow systems in the\nOrion Nebula, in particular the Herbig-Haro object HH202, with the Veil. These\ninteractions give rise to prominent blueward velocity shifts of the gas in the\nVeil. The unambiguous evidence for interaction of this flow system with the\nVeil shows that the distance between the Veil and the Trapezium stars needs to\nbe revised downwards to about 0.4pc. The depth of the ionized cavity is about\n0.7pc, which is much smaller than the depth and the lateral extent of the Veil.\nOur results reaffirm the blister model for the M42 HII region, while also\nrevealing its relation to the neutral environment on a larger scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 15:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Some of presented methods are\nillustrated by several examples involving Gamma and related functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 14:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Users may try to individually or collaboratively promote\nor demote a product. Collaborating unfair rating 'collusion' is more damaging\nthan individual unfair rating. Although collusion detection in general has been\nwidely studied, identifying collusion groups in online rating systems is less\nstudied and needs more investigation. In this paper, we study impact of\ncollusion in online rating systems and asses their susceptibility to collusion\nattacks. The proposed model uses a frequent itemset mining algorithm to detect\ncandidate collusion groups. Then, several indicators are used for identifying\ncollusion groups and for estimating how damaging such colluding groups might\nbe. Also, we propose an algorithm for finding possible collusive subgroup\ninside larger groups which are not identified as collusive. The model has been\nimplemented and we present results of experimental evaluation of our\nmethodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 07:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}
