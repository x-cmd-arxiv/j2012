It was discovered that the growth cycle is predefined by the\ndistribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass\nproduction. This distribution is quantitatively defined by the growth ratio\nparameter, which depends on the geometry of an organism, phase of growth and,\nindirectly, organism's biochemical machinery. The amount of produced biomass,\nin turn, defines the composition of biochemical reactions. Changing amount of\nnutrients diverted to biomass production is what forces organisms to proceed\nthrough the whole growth and replication cycle. The growth law can be\nformulated as follows: the rate of growth is proportional to influx of\nnutrients and growth ratio. Considering specific biochemical components of\ndifferent organisms, we find influxes of required nutrients and substitute them\ninto the growth equation; then, we compute growth curves for amoeba, wild type\nfission yeast, fission yeast's mutant.

Both stars have very similar atmospheric properties;\nhowever, using the individual frequencies extracted from the Kepler data, we\nhave determined quite distinct global properties, with increased precision\ncompared to that of earlier results.

In total 20 lines are detected, including CO J=4-3 through\nJ=13-12, 6 H2O rotational lines, and [CI] and [NII] fine-structure lines. The\nCO to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in NGC 6240 than Mrk 231.\nAlthough the CO ladders of NGC 6240 and Mrk 231 are very similar, UV and/or\nX-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gas\nin NGC 6240. We applied both C and J shock models to the H2 v=1-0 S(1) and\nv=2-1 S(1) lines and the CO rotational ladder. The CO ladder is best reproduced\nby a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_H=5 *\n10^4 cm^-3. We find that the solution best fitting the H2 lines is degenerate:\nThe shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1\nand n_H=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. The H2 lines thus need a much more\npowerful shock than the CO lines. We deduce that most of the gas is currently\nmoderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction\n(< 1 percent) of the ISM is exposed to the high velocity shocks.

In particular, low-energy nuclear\nresonances in the $^{25}$Mg(p,$\\gamma$)$^{26}$Al reaction affect the production\nof radioactive $^{26}$Al$^{gs}$ as well as the resulting Mg/Al abundance ratio.\nReliable estimations of these quantities require precise measurements of the\nstrengths of low-energy resonances. Based on a new experimental study performed\nat LUNA, we provide revised rates of the $^{25}$Mg(p,$\\gamma$)$^{26}$Al$^{gs}$\nand the $^{25}$Mg(p,$\\gamma$)$^{26}$Al$^{m}$ reactions with corresponding\nuncertainties. In the temperature range 50 to 150 MK, the new recommended rate\nof the $^{26}$Al$^{m}$ production is up to 5 times higher than previously\nassumed. In addition, at T$=100$ MK, the revised total reaction rate is a\nfactor of 2 higher. Note that this is the range of temperature at which the\nMg-Al cycle operates in an H-burning zone. The effects of this revision are\ndiscussed. Due to the significantly larger $^{25}$Mg(p,$\\gamma$)$^{26}$Al$^{m}$\nrate, the estimated production of $^{26}$Al$^{gs}$ in H-burning regions is less\nefficient than previously obtained. As a result, the new rates should imply a\nsmaller contribution from Wolf-Rayet stars to the galactic $^{26}$Al budget.\nSimilarly, we show that the AGB extra-mixing scenario does not appear able to\nexplain the most extreme values of $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al, i.e. $>10^{-2}$, found\nin some O-rich presolar grains. Finally, the substantial increase of the total\nreaction rate makes the hypothesis of a self-pollution by massive AGBs a more\nrobust explanation for the Mg-Al anticorrelation observed in Globular-Cluster\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 17:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Such a situation usually concerns large eddy\nsimulation of nonhomogeneous turbulent flows. The noncommutation of the average\nand differentiation operations leads to nonhomogeneous terms in the motion\nequations, that act as source terms of intensity which depend on the gradient\nof the filter scale and which, if neglected, induce a systematic error\nthroughout the solution. Here the different noncommutation terms of the motion\nequation are determined as functions of the \\delta-gradient and of the\n\\delta-derivatives of the filtered variables. It is shown here that\napproximated noncommutation terms of the fourth order of accuracy, with respect\nto the filtering scale, can be obtained using series expansions in the filter\nwidth of approximations based on finite differences and introducing successive\nlevels of filtering, which makes it suitable to use in conjunction with dynamic\nor mixed subgrid models. The procedure operates in a way which is independent\nof the type of filter in use and without increasing the differential order of\nthe equations, which, on the contrary, would require additional boundary\nconditions. It is not necessary to introduce a mapping function of the\nnonuniform grid in the physical domain into a uniform grid in an infinite\ndomain.

Markets are therefore often described as\n\"informationally efficient\", rapidly removing predictable price changes, and\nleaving only residual unpredictable fluctuations. This classical view of\nmarkets absorbing information and otherwise operating close to an equilibrium\nis challenged by extreme price fluctuations, in particular since they occur far\nmore frequently than can be accounted for by external news. Here we show that\nspeculative markets which absorb mainly self-generated information can exhibit\nboth: evolution towards efficient equilibrium states as well as their\nsubsequent destabilization. This peculiar dynamics, a generic instability\narising from an adaptive control which annihilates predictable information, is\nrealized in a minimal agent-based market model where the impacts of agents'\nstrategies adapt according to their trading success. This adaptation implements\na learning rule for the market as a whole minimizing predictable price changes.\nThe model reproduces stylized statistical properties of price changes in\nquantitative detail, including heavy tailed log return distributions and\nvolatility clusters. Our results demonstrate that the perpetual occurrence of\nmarket instabilities can be a direct consequence of the very mechanisms that\nlead to market efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 18:27:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 18:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

However EM follow-up of GW events presents new challenges. GW events\nwill have large sky error regions, on the order of 10-100 square degrees, which\ncan be made up of many disjoint patches. When searching such large areas there\nis potential contamination by EM transients unrelated to the GW event.\nFurthermore, the characteristics of possible EM counterparts to GW events are\nalso uncertain. It is therefore desirable to be able to assess the statistical\nsignificance of a candidate EM counterpart, which can only be done by\nperforming background studies of large data sets. Current image processing\npipelines such as that used by ROTSE are not usually optimised for large-scale\nprocessing.

We\nalso propose a simple ad hoc statistic for ranking candidates as more likely to\nbe associated with the GW trigger.

EM\ncandidates from a randomly selected set of images are compared to a background\nestimated from the analysis of 102 additional sets of archival images.

In the proposed distributed framework,\neach node has to perform less number of iterations of OMP compared to the\nsparsity index of the sparse signal. Thus, with each node having a very small\nnumber of compressive measurements, a significant performance gain in support\nrecovery is achieved via the proposed collaborative scheme compared to the case\nwhere each node estimates the sparsity pattern independently and then fusion is\nperformed to get a global estimate. We further extend the algorithm to estimate\nthe sparsity pattern in a binary hypothesis testing framework, where the\nalgorithm first detects the presence of a sparse signal collaborating among\nnodes with a fewer number of iterations of OMP and then increases the number of\niterations to estimate the sparsity pattern only if the signal is detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 19:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-29"}

We report the detection of far-infrared (FIR) [CII] line emission from\nthe nebulae using observations made with Herschel PACS. The infrared line\nemission is extended and cospatial with optical H{\\alpha}+[NII],\nfar-ultraviolet CIV lines, and soft X-ray emission. The filamentary nebulae\nevidently contain multi-phase material spanning a temperature range of at least\n5 orders of magnitude, from ~100 K to ~10^7 K. This material has most likely\nbeen uplifted by the AGN from the center of M87. The thermal pressure of the\n10^4 K phase appears to be significantly lower than that of the surrounding hot\nintra-cluster medium (ICM) indicating the presence of additional turbulent and\nmagnetic pressure in the filaments. If the turbulence in the filaments is\nsubsonic then the magnetic field strength required to balance the pressure of\nthe surrounding ICM is B~30-70 {\\mu}G. The spectral properties of the soft\nX-ray emission from the filaments indicate that it is due to thermal plasma\nwith kT~0.5-1 keV, which is cooling by mixing with the cold gas and/or\nradiatively. Charge exchange can be ruled out as a significant source of soft\nX-rays. Both cooling and mixing scenarios predict gas with a range of\ntemperatures. This is at first glance inconsistent with the apparent lack of\nX-ray emitting gas with kT<0.5 keV. However, we show that the missing very soft\nX-ray emission could be absorbed by the cold gas in the filaments with an\nintegrated hydrogen column density of ~1.6x10^21 cm^-2, providing a natural\nexplanation for the apparent temperature floor to the X-ray emission at kT~0.5\nkeV. The FIR through ultra-violet line emission is most likely primarily\npowered by the ICM particles penetrating the cold gas following a shearing\ninduced mixing process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 20:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 19:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

At the same time, it can be argued that singularities and boundaries\nare an important aspect of the geometry of realistic data.\n  In this paper we consider the behavior of graph Laplacians at points at or\nnear boundaries and two main types of other singularities: intersections, where\ndifferent manifolds come together and sharp \"edges\", where a manifold sharply\nchanges direction. We show that the behavior of graph Laplacian near these\nsingularities is quite different from that in the interior of the manifolds. In\nfact, a phenomenon somewhat reminiscent of the Gibbs effect in the analysis of\nFourier series, can be observed in the behavior of graph Laplacian near such\npoints. Unlike in the interior of the domain, where graph Laplacian converges\nto the Laplace-Beltrami operator, near singularities graph Laplacian tends to a\nfirst-order differential operator, which exhibits different scaling behavior as\na function of the kernel width. One important implication is that while points\nnear the singularities occupy only a small part of the total volume, the\ndifference in scaling results in a disproportionately large contribution to the\ntotal behavior. Another significant finding is that while the scaling behavior\nof the operator is the same near different types of singularities, they are\nvery distinct at a more refined level of analysis.\n  We believe that a comprehensive understanding of these structures in addition\nto the standard case of a smooth manifold can take us a long way toward better\nmethods for analysis of complex non-linear data and can lead to significant\nprogress in algorithm design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 20:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-29"}

They cause angular momentum to be\nredistributed within the galaxy, emitted mainly from (near-)resonant material\nat the inner Lindblad resonance of the bar, and absorbed mainly by\n(near-)resonant material in the spheroid (i.e., the halo and, whenever\nrelevant, the bulge) and in the outer disk. Spheroids delay and slow down the\ninitial growth of the bar they host, but, at the later stages of the evolution,\nthey strengthen the bar by absorbing angular momentum. Increased velocity\ndispersion in the (near-)resonant regions delays bar formation and leads to\nless strong bars. When bars form they are vertically thin, but soon their inner\nparts puff up and form what is commonly known as the boxy/peanut bulge. This\ngives a complex and interesting shape to the bar which explains a number of\nobservations and also argues that the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar in our\nGalaxy are, respectively, the thin and the thick part of a single bar. The\nvalue of the bar pattern speed may be set by optimising the balance between\nemitters and absorbers, so that a maximum amount of angular momentum is\nredistributed. As they evolve, bars grow stronger and rotate slower. Bars also\nredistribute matter within the galaxy, create a disky bulge (pseudo-bulge),\nincrease the disk scale-length and extent and drive substructures such as\nspirals and rings.

We find that both the relative gas\nfraction and the halo shape play a major role in the formation and evolution of\nthe bar. In gas-rich simulations, the disc stays near-axisymmetric much longer\nthan in gas-poor ones, and, when the bar starts growing, it does so at a much\nslower rate. Due to these two effects combined, large-scale bars form much\nlater in gas-rich than in gas-poor discs. This can explain the observation that\nbars are in place earlier in massive red disc galaxies than in blue spirals. We\nalso find that the morphological characteristics in the bar region are strongly\ninfluenced by the gas fraction. In particular, the bar at the end of the\nsimulation is much weaker in gas-rich cases. In no case did we witness bar\ndestruction.\n  Halo triaxiality has a dual influence on bar strength. In the very early\nstages of the simulation it induces bar formation to start earlier. On the\nother hand, during the later, secular evolution phase, triaxial haloes lead to\nconsiderably less increase of the bar strength than spherical ones. The shape\nof the halo evolves considerably with time. The inner halo parts may become\nmore elongated, or more spherical, depending on the bar strength. The main body\nof initially triaxial haloes evolves towards sphericity, but in initially\nstrongly triaxial cases it stops well short of becoming spherical. Part of the\nangular momentum absorbed by the halo generates considerable rotation of the\nhalo particles that stay located relatively near the disc for long periods of\ntime. Another part generates halo bulk rotation, which, contrary to that of the\nbar, increases with time but stays small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 21:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, multipole space determinations are\nsubject to many difficulties, and a real-space analysis can provide a\nstraightforward alternative. In this work we describe a numerical method for\nremoving Lorentz- boost effects from real-space temperature maps. We show that\nto deboost a map so that one can accurately extract the temperature power\nspectrum requires calculating the boost kernel at a finer pixelization than one\nmight naively expect. In idealized cases that allow for easy comparison to\nanalytic results, we have confirmed that there is indeed mode mixing among the\nspherical harmonic coefficients of the temperature. We find that using a boost\nkernel calculated at Nside=8192 leads to a 1% bias in the binned boosted power\nspectrum at l~2000, while individual Cls exhibit ~5% fluctuations around the\nbinned average. However, this bias is dominated by pixelization effects and not\nthe aberration and Doppler shift of CMB photons that causes the fluctuations.\nPerforming analysis on maps with galactic cuts does not induce any additional\nerror in the boosted, binned power spectra over the full sky analysis. For\nmultipoles that are free of resolution effects, there is no detectable\ndeviation between the binned boosted and unboosted spectra. This result arises\nbecause the power spectrum is a slowly varying function of and does not show\nthat, in general, Lorentz boosts can be neglected for other cosmological\nquantities such as polarization maps or higher-point functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 21:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

The best diagnostic lines and\nthe relevant atomic data are discussed in detail. Radiances over the quiet Sun\nare also considered, with comparisons with previous measurements. Some\ndepartures in the shapes of the ground calibration responsivities are found at\nthe start of the mission. These shapes do not change significantly over time,\nwith the exception of the shorter wavelengths of the EIS short-wavelength (SW)\nchannel, which shows some degradation. The sensitivity of the SW channel at\nlonger wavelengths does not show significant degradation, while that of the\nlong-wavelength (LW) channel shows a significant degradation with time. By the\nbeginning of 2010 the responsivity of the LW channel was already a factor of\ntwo or more lower than the values measured on the ground. A first-order\ncorrection is proposed. With this correction, the main ratios of lines in the\ntwo channels become constant to within a relative 20%, and the He II 256 A\nradiances over the quiet Sun also become constant over time.

It is demonstrated that quantization in terms of neutral\nparticles and antiparticles is possible in terms of the states with\nwell-defined spin polarization. Such states are localizable and can form wave\npackets in a given asymptotic region. In this case, the problem can be\ntechnically reduced to the problem of charged-particle creation by an electric\nstep. In particular, the relation to the Schwinger method of an effective\naction is established. As an example, we calculate neutral fermion creation\nfrom the vacuum by a linearly growing magnetic field. We show that the total\nnumber and the vacuum-to-vacuum transition probability of created pairs depend\nonly on the gradient of the magnetic field, but not on its strength, and this\nfact does not depend on the spacetime dimension. We show that the created flux\naimed in one of the directions is formed from fluxes of particles and\nantiparticles of equal intensity and with the same magnetic moments parallel to\nthe external field. In such a flux, particle and antiparticle velocities that\nare perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic moment and flux direction are\nessentially depressed. The creation of neutral fermions with anomalous magnetic\nmoments leads to a smoothing of the initial magnetic field, which in turn\nprevents appearance of superstrong constant magnetic fields. Our estimations\nshow that the vacuum instability with respect to the creation of neutrinos and\neven neutrons in strong magnetic fields of the magnetars and fields generated\nduring a supernova explosion has to be taken into account in the astrophysics.\nIn particular, it may be of significance for dark matter studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 22:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2013 20:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 21:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}

Here we present a detailed analysis of about 43\nmonths of accumulated Fermi-LAT data of the gamma-ray counterpart of the source\ninitially reported in the 2nd Fermi-LAT catalog, and of newly acquired Suzaku\nX-ray data. We confirm its detection at GeV photon energies, and analyze the\nextension and variability of the gamma-ray source in the LAT dataset, in which\nit appears as a steady gamma-ray emitter. The X-ray core of Centaurus B is\ndetected as a bright source of a continuum radiation. We do not detect however\nany diffuse X-ray emission from the known radio lobes, with the provided upper\nlimit only marginally consistent with the previously claimed ASCA flux. Two\nscenarios that connect the X-ray and gamma-ray properties are considered. In\nthe first one, we assume that the diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission component\nis not significantly below the derived Suzaku upper limit. In this case,\nmodeling the inverse-Compton emission shows that the observed gamma-ray flux of\nthe source may in principle be produced within the lobes. This association\nwould imply that efficient in-situ acceleration of the radiating electrons is\noccurring and that the lobes are dominated by the pressure from the\nrelativistic particles. In the second scenario, with the diffuse X-ray emission\nwell below the Suzaku upper limits, the lobes in the system are instead\ndominated by the magnetic pressure. In this case, the observed gamma-ray flux\nis not likely to be produced within the lobes, but instead within the nuclear\nparts of the jet. By means of synchrotron self-Compton modeling we show that\nthis possibility could be consistent with the broad-band data collected for the\nunresolved core of Centaurus B, including the newly derived Suzaku spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 23:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A second detector at a distinct baseline also breaks the\ndegeneracy between {\\theta}_12 and the background neutrino flux from, for\nexample, distant reactors and increases the effective target mass, which is\nlimited by current designs to about 20 kton/detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 06:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

Despite the\ngrowing of crystal-like bond orientational order, we reveal that the stability\nagainst crystallization with increasing polydispersity is due to an increasing\npopulation of icosahedral arrangements of particles. Our results suggest that,\nfor this type of systems, many-body correlations are a manifestation of the\nlink between the vitrification and the crystallization phenomena.

Optimizing the power control for these\nconfigurations results in a new class of multiuser power-control problems\nfeaturing circuit-power constraints, specifying that the transferred power must\nbe sufficiently large to support the operation of the receiver circuitry.\nSolving these problems gives a set of power-control algorithms that exploit\nchannel diversity in frequency for simultaneously enhancing the throughput and\nthe MPT efficiency. For the system configurations with variable coding rates,\nthe algorithms are variants of water-filling that account for the circuit-power\nconstraints. The optimal algorithms for those configurations with fixed coding\nrates are shown to sequentially allocate mobiles their required power for\ndecoding in the ascending order until the entire budgeted power is spent.

(2010) studied the evolution of the active region (AR) NOAA 11024\nconcluding that during the penumbra formation the umbra area remains constant\nand that the increase of the total sunspot area is caused exclusively by the\npenumbra growth. In this presentation the Schlichenmaier's conclusion is\nfirstly tested, investigating the evolution of four different ARs. Hundreds of\nIntensitygram images from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) images are\nused, obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, in order to describe the area\nevolution of the above ARs and estimate the increase and decrease rates for\numbra and penumbra areas, separately. A simple magnetohydrodynamic model is\nthen tentatively used in a first approximation to explain the observed results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 10:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-30"}

Three different scenarios are considered: The force-extension\nrelation of tethered polymers, the relaxation of an initially stretched\nsemiflexible polymer, and semiflexible polymers under shear flow. We find\nquantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for the force-extension\nrelation and the time dependence of the entropically contracting polymer. The\nsemiflexible polymers under shear flow exhibit significant conformational\nchanges at large shear rates, where less stiff polymers are extended by the\nflow, whereas rather stiff polymers are contracted. In addition, the polymers\nare aligned by the flow, thereby the two-dimensional semiflexible polymers\nbehave similarly to flexible polymers in three dimensions. The tumbling times\ndisplay a power-law dependence at high shear rate rates with an exponent\ncomparable to the one of flexible polymers in three-dimensional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 11:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

The statistical physics description amounts to\ndescribe the modification of the color correlation length with energy as a\ncompression process for which non equilibrium thermodynamic properties are\napplicable.

We extend\nthis approach to the initial pre-equilibrium (glasma) state of an heavy-ion\ncollision. It allows for a definition of the initial entropy before the\nevolution towards the hydrodynamic regime as a function of the glasma\ncorrelation length and an overlap parameter characterizing the low-momentum\nspectrum of the glasma state. This initial entropy, by extension to the N=4 SYM\ntheory, is then matched as the key input parameter to the strong coupling\nevaluation of thermalization towards the hydrodynamic regime based on the\nAdS/CFT correspondence.

We begin with a review of the BLG and ABJM models\nof multiple M2-branes and our focus will be on their formulation in terms of\n3-algebras. We then examine the coupling of multiple M2-branes to the\nbackground 3-form and 6-form gauge fields of eleven-dimensional supergravity.\nIn particular we show in detail how a natural generalisation of the Myers\nflux-terms, along with the resulting curvature of the background metric, leads\nto mass terms in the effective field theory. Working to lowest nontrivial order\nin fermions, we demonstrate the supersymmetric invariance of the\nfour-derivative order corrected Lagrangian of the Euclidean BLG theory and\ndetermine the theory's higher derivative corrected supersymmetry\ntransformations. The supersymmetry algebra is also shown to close on the scalar\nand gauge fields. We also consider periodic arrays of M2-branes in the ABJM\nmodel in the spirit of a circle compactification to D2-branes in type IIA\nstring theory. The result is a curious formulation of three-dimensional\nmaximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Upon further T-duality on a\ntransverse torus we obtain a non-manifest-Lorentz-invariant description of\nfive-dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills which can be viewed as an\nM-theory description of M5-branes on $\\mathbb{T}^3$. After reviewing work to\ndescribe multiple M5-branes using 3-algebras we show how the resulting novel\nsystem of equations reduces to one-dimensional motion on instanton moduli\nspace. Quantisation leads to the previous light-cone proposal of the (2,0)\ntheory, generalised to include a potential that arises on the Coulomb branch as\nwell as couplings to background gauge and self-dual 2-form fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 14:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-30"}

In this work, we aim to extend the\npseudopotential LB model to simulate multiphase flows at large density ratio\nand relatively high Reynolds number. First, based on our recent work [Li et\nal., Phys. Rev.

Next, through\ninvestigating the effects of the parameter a in the Carnahan-Starling equation\nof state, we find that the interface thickness is approximately proportional to\n1/sqrt(a). Using a smaller a will lead to a wider interface thickness, which\ncan reduce the spurious currents and enhance the numerical stability of the\npseudopotential model at large density ratio. Furthermore, it is found that a\nlower liquid viscosity can be gained in the pseudopotential model by increasing\nthe kinematic viscosity ratio between the vapor and liquid phases. The improved\npseudopotential LB model is numerically validated via the simulations of\nstationary droplet and droplet oscillation. Using the improved model as well as\nthe above treatments, numerical simulations of droplet splashing on a thin\nliquid film are conducted at a density ratio in excess of 500 with Reynolds\nnumbers ranging from 40 to 1000.

Finally, the nonequilibrium dynamics of the microscopic\ndegrees of freedom for the superfluid is reviewed for the self-consistent and\nnon self-consistent cases.

While this is an attractive idea, its viability needs to be tested with\nnonperturbative studies. The model that we study here, the so-called \"3-4-5\"\nmodel, is anomaly free and the presence of massless states in the mirror sector\nis not required by anomaly matching arguments, in contrast to the \"1-0\" model\nthat was studied previously. We have computed the polarization tensor in this\ntheory and find a directional discontinuity that appears to be nonzero in the\nlimit of an infinite lattice, which is equivalent to the continuum limit at\nfixed physical volume. We show that a similar behavior occurs for the free\nmassless Ginsparg-Wilson fermion, where the polarization tensor is known to\nhave a directional discontinuity in the continuum limit. We thus find support\nfor the conclusion that in the continuum limit of the 3-4-5 model, there are\nmassless charged modes in the mirror sector so that it does not decouple from\nthe light sector. The value of the discontinuity we obtain allows for two\ninterpretations: either a chiral gauge theory does not emerge and mirror-sector\nfermions in a chiral anomaly free representation remain massless, or a massless\nvectorlike mirror fermion appears. We end by discussing some questions for\nfuture study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 15:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 19:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 14:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
