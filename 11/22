When DNA is damaged p53 induces the cell cycle arrest to\nprevent the transmission of the damage to cell progeny, triggers the production\nof proteins for DNA repair and ultimately calls for apoptosis. In particular,\nthe p53-Mdm2 feedback loop seems to be the key circuit in this response of\ncells to damage. For many years, based on measurements over populations of\ncells it was believed that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop was the responsible for\nthe existence of damped oscillations in the levels of p53 and Mdm2 after DNA\ndamage. However, recent measurements in individual human cells have shown that\np53 and its regulator Mdm2 develop sustained oscillations over long periods of\ntime even in the absence of stress. These results have attracted a lot of\ninterest, first because they open a new experimental framework to study the p53\nand its interactions and second because they challenge years of mathematical\nmodels with new and accurate data on single cells. Inspired by these\nexperiments standard models of the p53-Mdm2 circuit were modified introducing\nad-hoc some biologically motivated noise that becomes responsible for the\nstability of the oscillations. Here, we follow an alternative approach\nproposing that the noise that stabilizes the fluctuations is the intrinsic\nnoise due to the finite nature of the populations of p53 and Mdm2 in a single\ncell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 16:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-22"}

Such large motion of the\neastern Eurasia region contradicts any traditional rigid plate tectonic\nreconstruction, but agrees with the more recent concepts of non-rigidity of\nboth continental and oceanic lithosphere over geological times.

We find that the energetics of the DWs are dominated by the\ncapability of the domains to match their O$_6$ octahedra rotation patterns at\nthe plane of the wall, so that the distortion of the oxygen groups is\nminimized. Our results thus indicate that, in essence, it is the discontinuity\nin the AFD order parameter, and not the change in the electric polarization,\nwhat decides which crystallographic planes are most likely to host BFO's\nFE-DWs. Such a result clearly suggests that the O$_6$ rotational patterns play\na primary role in the FE phase of this compound, in contrast with the usual\n(implicit) assumption that they are subordinated to the FE order parameter. Our\ncalculations show that, for the most favorable cases in BFO, the DW energy\namounts to a several tens of mJ/m$^2$, which is higher than what was computed\nfor other ferroelectric perovskites with no O$_6$ rotations. Interestingly, we\nfind that the structure of BFO at the most stable DWs resembles the atomic\narrangements that are characteristic of low-lying (meta)stable phases of the\nmaterial.

We find that a circular binary system with a\nmisaligned circumbinary disk normally produces a double peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit. This is because each black hole\npasses across the circumbinary disk plane and captures gas twice in one orbital\nperiod. Even in misaligned systems, however, a single peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit is produced, if the orbital\neccentricity is moderately large (e\\lesssim0.3). The number of peaks in mass\naccretion rates can be understood simply in terms of the orbital phase\ndependence of the distance between each binary black hole and its closest inner\nedge of the circumbinary disk. In the cases of eccentric binary black holes\nhaving different masses, the less massive black hole can get closer to the\ncircumbinary disk than the massive one, thus tidally splitting gas from its\ninner edge, but the created gas flows are comparably captured by both black\nholes with a short time delay.

However, relaying\nof primary packets may introduce delays on the secondary packets (called\nsecondary delay) and require additional power budget in order to forward the\nprimary packets that is especially crucial when the network is deployed using\nsensors with limited power resources. To this end, an admission control can be\nemployed in order to manage efficiently the relaying in cognitive radio sensor\nnetworks. In this paper, we first analyse and formulate the secondary delay and\nthe required power budget of the secondary sensor node in relation with the\nacceptance factor that indicates whether the primary packets are allowed to be\nforwarded or not.

The discussion finds important applications in cosmology,\nlike e.g. in the description of test Klein-Gordon fields and scalar\nperturbations in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime in the observationally\nfavored flat case. Two types of ambiguities in the quantization are analyzed.\nFirst, the infinite ambiguity existing in the choice of a Fock representation\nfor the canonical commutation relations, understandable as the freedom in the\nchoice of inequivalent vacua for a given field. Besides, in cosmological\nsituations, it is customary to scale the fields by time dependent functions,\nwhich absorb part of the evolution arising from the spacetime, which is treated\nclassically. This leads to an additional ambiguity, this time in the choice of\na canonical pair of field variables. We show that both types of ambiguities are\nremoved by the requirements of (a) invariance of the vacuum under the\nsymmetries of the three-torus, and (b) unitary implementation of the dynamics\nin the quantum theory. In this way, one arrives at a unique class of unitarily\nequivalent Fock quantizations for the system.

The problem with such an approach, however, is the large\namount of queries often required (i.e., a long \"mixing time\") for a random walk\nto reach a desired (stationary) sampling distribution.\n  In this paper, we consider a novel problem of enabling a faster random walk\nover online social networks by \"rewiring\" the social network on-the-fly.\nSpecifically, we develop Modified TOpology (MTO)-Sampler which, by using only\ninformation exposed by the restrictive web interface, constructs a \"virtual\"\noverlay topology of the social network while performing a random walk, and\nensures that the random walk follows the modified overlay topology rather than\nthe original one.

Moreover, many\nnaturally occurring signals show scale-free long range correlations implying\nthat the natural prediction-relevant timescale is essentially unbounded. Hence\nthe learner should maintain information from the longest possible timescale\nallowed by resource availability.

The root-n consistency and asymptotic normality\nfor the estimator obtained from solving the resulting estimating equations are\nachieved, and a Wilks type theorem for testing the index is demonstrated. A\nnoticeable result we obtain is that our estimator for $\\bolds{\\beta}$ has\nsmaller or equal limiting variance than the estimator of Carroll et al. [J.\nAmer. Statist. Assoc. 92 (1997) 447-489]. A fixed-point iterative scheme for\ncomputing this estimator is proposed. This algorithm only involves\none-dimensional nonparametric smoothers, thereby avoiding the data sparsity\nproblem caused by high model dimensionality. Numerical studies based on\nsimulation and on applications suggest that this new estimating system is quite\npowerful and easy to implement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 07:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-26"}

Based on simulated mass-transfer rates from misaligned Be\ndisks, together with simplified accretion flow models, we show that\nmass-accretion rates estimated from the luminosity of the normal X-ray\noutbursts are consistent with those obtained with advection-dominated accretion\nflows, not with the standard, radiative-cooling dominated, accretion. Our RIAF\nscenario for normal X-ray outbursts resolves problems that have challenged the\nstandard disk picture for these outbursts. When a misaligned Be disk crosses\nthe orbit of the neutron star, e.g., by warping, the neutron star can capture a\nlarge amount of mass via BHL-type accretion during the disk transit event. We\nnumerically show that such a process can reproduce the X-ray luminosity of\ngiant X-ray outbursts. In the case of very high Be disk density, the accretion\nflow associated with the disk transit becomes supercritical, giving rise to the\nluminosity higher than the Eddington luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 08:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This work examines evidence of a\ncosmic ray cloud link from a range of sources, including satellite-based cloud\nmeasurements and long-term ground-based climatological measurements. The\nsatellite-based studies can be divided into two categories: 1) monthly to\ndecadal timescale correlations, and 2) daily timescale epoch-superpositional\n(composite) analysis. The latter analyses frequently focus on high-magnitude\nreductions in the cosmic ray flux known as Forbush Decrease (FD) events. At\npresent, two long-term independent global satellite cloud datasets are\navailable (ISCCP and MODIS). Although the differences between them are\nconsiderable, neither shows evidence of a solar-cloud link at either long or\nshort timescales. Furthermore, reports of observed correlations between solar\nactivity and cloud over the 1983 to 1995 period are attributed to the chance\nagreement between solar changes and artificially induced cloud trends. It is\npossible that the satellite cloud datasets and analysis methods may simply be\ntoo insensitive to detect a small solar signal. Evidence from ground-based\nstudies suggests that some weak but statistically significant CR-cloud\nrelationships may exist at regional scales, involving mechanisms related to the\nglobal electric circuit. However, a poor understanding of these mechanisms and\ntheir effects on cloud make the net impacts of such links uncertain. Regardless\nof this, it is clear that there is no robust evidence of a widespread link\nbetween the cosmic ray flux and clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 10:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-26"}

This property of RNS is very\nhelpful to reduce the complexity of calculation in many applications. A residue\nnumber system represents a large integer using a set of smaller integers,\ncalled residues. But the area overhead, cost and speed not only depend on this\nword length, but also the selection of moduli, which is a very crucial step for\nresidue system. This parameter determines bit efficiency, area, frequency etc.\nIn this paper a new moduli set selection technique is proposed to improve bit\nefficiency which can be used to construct a residue system for digital signal\nprocessing environment.

The spectroscopic observations cover the spectral range 3600-6900 A\nat a resolution R ~ 1000 and are thus suitable for separating the underlying\nabsorption from the emission of the Hbeta line as well as the two [NII] lines\nfrom the Halpha emission. We measure the fluxes and the equivalent widths of\nthe strongest emission lines ([OII], Hbeta, [OIII], [NII], Halpha, and [SII]).\nThe data are used to study the distribution of the equivalent width of all the\nemission lines, of the Balmer decrement C(Hbeta) and of the observed underlying\nBalmer absorption under Hbeta in this sample. Combining these new spectroscopic\ndata with those available at other frequencies, we also study the dependence of\nC(Hbeta) and E.W.Hbeta_{abs} on morphological type, stellar mass and stellar\nsurface density, star formation rate, birthrate parameter and metallicity in\ngalaxies belonging to different environments (fields vs. Virgo). The\ndistribution of the equivalent width of all the emission lines, of C(Hbeta) and\nE.W.Hbeta_{abs} are systematically different in cluster and field galaxies. The\nBalmer decrement increases with stellar mass, stellar surface density,\nmetallicity and star formation rate of the observed galaxies, while it is\nunexpectedly almost independent from the column density of the atomic and\nmolecular gas. The dependence of C(Hbeta) on stellar mass is steeper than that\npreviously found in other works.

The effect of different applied powers on the chemical structure and\noptical properties of the conjugated polymers was investigated. The fabricated\ndevices with structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ plasma polymerized Naphthalene/Alq3/Al\nshowed broadband Electroluminescence (EL) emission peaks with center at 535-550\nnm. Using different structural and optical tests, connection between polymers\nchemical structure and optical properties under different plasma powers has\nbeen studied. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies\nconfirmed that a conjugated polymer film with a 3-D cross-linked network was\ndeveloped. By increasing the power, products tended to form as highly\ncross-linked polymer films. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of plasma polymers\nshowed different excimerc emissions, resulted from crosslinked architecture.\nFurther analysis showed an interesting change in dominance of excimeric\nemissions by increasing the power. In fact, as the plasma power increased, the\noptical properties showed two different domains; up to 200 w, EL, PL and UV-Vis\nspectra red-shifted and broadened significantly. At higher powers, a reverse\nbehavior was observed. Also, the relation between the film structure and plasma\nspecies was investigated using Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 13:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-26"}

In this way, decoding error propagation is avoided at the relay.\nMeanwhile, since the relay attempts to decode the XOR of the two messages\ninstead of explicitly decoding the two messages, the larger usable range of XOR\nnetwork coding can be obtained. As XOR network coding can avoid noise\npropagation, DNF-AF would mitigate noise propagation.

In zero field, the spectral function of the hanging\ndot has previously been shown to exhibit a split-peak structure near the Fermi\nlevel due to \"Kondo resonance filtering\" by the bridging dot. We show using the\nnumerical renormalization group that application of a magnetic field leads to a\nsubtle interplay between electronic interference, Kondo physics, and Zeeman\nsplitting with nontrivial consequences for the spectral and transport\nproperties. The value of the hanging-dot spectral function at the Fermi level\nexhibits a nonuniversal field dependence that can be explained using a\ngeneralized Friedel sum rule for a Kondo system with energy-dependent\nhybridization. The magnetic field also accentuates the exchange-mediated\ninterdot coupling, which dominates the ground state at intermediate fields\nleading to the formation of antiparallel magnetic moments on the dots. By\ntuning gate voltages and the magnetic field, one can achieve complete spin\npolarization of the linear conductance between the leads, raising the prospect\nof applications of the device as a highly tunable spin filter.

The package EMMIX-uskew implements\na closed-form expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for computing the maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters for the (unrestricted) FM-MST model\nin R. EMMIX-uskew also supports visualization of fitted contours in two and\nthree dimensions, and random sample generation from a specified FM-uMST\ndistribution.\n  Finite mixtures of skew t-distributions have proven to be useful in modelling\nheterogeneous data with asymmetric and heavy tail behaviour, for example,\ndatasets from flow cytometry. In recent years, various versions of mixtures\nwith multivariate skew t (MST) distributions have been proposed. However, these\nmodels adopted some restricted characterizations of the component MST\ndistributions so that the E-step of the EM algorithm can be evaluated in closed\nform. This paper focuses on mixtures with unrestricted MST components, and\ndescribes an iterative algorithm for the computation of the ML estimates of its\nmodel parameters.\n  The usefulness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in three\napplications to real data sets. The first example illustrates the use of the\nmain function fmmst in the package by fitting a MST distribution to a bivariate\nunimodal flow cytometric sample. The second example fits a mixture of MST\ndistributions to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) data, and demonstrate\nthat EMMIX-uskew can provide better clustering results than mixtures with\nrestricted MST components. In the third example, EMMIX-uskew is applied to\nclassify cells in a trivariate flow cytometric dataset. Comparisons with other\navailable methods suggests that the EMMIX-uskew result achieved a lower\nmisclassification rate with respect to the labels given by benchmark gating\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 13:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 03:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-29"}

We find that there is a significant flat spectrum population present in\nthe 10C sample which is missing from the samples selected at 1.4 GHz. The 10C\nsample is compared to a sample of sources selected from the SKADS Simulated Sky\nby Wilman et al. and we find that this simulation fails to reproduce the\nobserved spectral index distribution and significantly underpredicts the number\nof sources in the faintest flux density bin. It is likely that the observed\nfaint, flat spectrum sources are a result of the cores of FRI sources becoming\ndominant at high frequencies. These results highlight the importance of\nstudying this faint, high frequency population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 14:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

The main ingredient of this formalism is the dynamical formation of\nbound-states with vanishing mass, which give rise to effective vertices\ncontaining massless poles; these latter vertices, in turn, trigger the\nSchwinger mechanism, and allow for the gauge-invariant generation of an\neffective gluon mass. This particular approach has the conceptual advantage of\nrelating the gluon mass directly to quantities that are intrinsic to the\nbound-state formation itself, such as the \"transition amplitude\" and the\ncorresponding \"bound-state wave-function\". As a result, the dynamical evolution\nof the gluon mass is largely determined by a Bethe-Salpeter equation that\ncontrols the dynamics of the relevant wave-function, rather than the\nSchwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator, as happens in the standard\ntreatment. The precise structure and field-theoretic properties of the\ntransition amplitude are scrutinized in a variety of independent ways. In\nparticular, a parallel study within the linear covariant (Landau) gauge and the\nbackground-field method reveals that a powerful identity, known to be valid at\nthe level of conventional Green's functions, relates also the background and\nquantum transition amplitudes. Despite the differences in the ingredients and\nterminology employed, the massless bound-state formalism is absolutely\nequivalent to the standard approach based on Schwinger-Dyson equations.

Being bound systems in gravity fields, these are\nstable reservoirs for the Higgs bosons, and vector bosons of Z and W as well as\nsupersymmetric bosons. Upon gravitational disturbances, such as a gravitational\ncollapse, these objects are relieved from the BE condensate bound states and\ndecay or interact with each other freely. Using the repulsive nature of gravity\nat short distances which was obtained by the present author as quantum\ncorrections to gravity, the particles produced by the decays or interactions of\nthe bosons liberated from BE condensates can be emitted outside the horizon for\nour observation. It is suggested that the recently observed gamma ray peak at\n129.8 +- 2.4 GeV from FERMI Large Area Telescope may be evidence for the\nexistence of the Higgs boson condensates. The BE condensates of supersymmetric\nbosons are the most likely sources for the gamma rays from DMP (dark matter\nparticle) and anti-DMP collisions. It is shown that the said process from DMPs\nspread in the galaxy is too small for the incident DMP with the intensity of\nthe cosmic ray energy spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 22:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

We make\nthe structural assumption that the two vectors are members of known subspaces,\none with dimension $N$ and the other with dimension $K$. Although the observed\nconvolution is nonlinear in both $\\boldsymbol{w}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$, it is\nlinear in the rank-1 matrix formed by their outer product\n$\\boldsymbol{w}\\boldsymbol{x}^*$. This observation allows us to recast the\ndeconvolution problem as low-rank matrix recovery problem from linear\nmeasurements, whose natural convex relaxation is a nuclear norm minimization\nprogram.\n  We prove the effectiveness of this relaxation by showing that for \"generic\"\nsignals, the program can deconvolve $\\boldsymbol{w}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$\nexactly when the maximum of $N$ and $K$ is almost on the order of $L$. That is,\nwe show that if $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is drawn from a random subspace of dimension\n$N$, and $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is a vector in a subspace of dimension $K$ whose\nbasis vectors are \"spread out\" in the frequency domain, then nuclear norm\nminimization recovers $\\boldsymbol{w}\\boldsymbol{x}^*$ without error.\n  We discuss this result in the context of blind channel estimation in\ncommunications. If we have a message of length $N$ which we code using a random\n$L\\times N$ coding matrix, and the encoded message travels through an unknown\nlinear time-invariant channel of maximum length $K$, then the receiver can\nrecover both the channel response and the message when $L\\gtrsim N+K$, to\nwithin constant and log factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 18:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 19:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2018 06:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}
