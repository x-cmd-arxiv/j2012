A model of heliosheath density and energy spectra of alpha-particles\nand He+ ions carried by the solar wind is developed. Neutralization of\nheliosheath He+ ions, mainly by charge exchange (CX) with neutral interstellar\nH and He atoms, gives rise to ~0.2 - ~100 keV fluxes of energetic neutral He\natoms (He ENA). Such fluxes, if observed, would give information about plasmas\nin the heliosheath and heliospheric tail. Methods. Helium ions crossing the\ntermination shock (TS) constitute suprathermal (test) particles convected by\n(locally also diffusing through) hydrodynamically calculated background plasma\nflows (three versions of flows are employed). The He ions proceed from the TS\ntowards heliopause (HP) and finally to the heliospheric tail (HT). Calculations\nof the evolution of alpha- and He+ particle densities and energy spectra\ninclude binary interactions with background plasma and interstellar atoms,\nadiabatic heating (cooling) resulting from flow compression (rarefaction), and\nCoulomb scattering on background plasma. Results. Neutralization of\nsuprathermal He ions leads to the emergence of He ENA fluxes with energy\nspectra modified by the Compton-Getting effect at emission and ENA loss during\nflight to the Sun. Energy-integrated He ENA intensities are in the range ~0.05\n- ~50 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 depending on spectra at the TS (assumed\nkappa-distributions), background plasma model, and look direction.

Encoding rate control has thus to consider both texture and depth\ndata. Due to different structures of depth and texture images and their\ndifferent roles on the rendered views, distributing the available bit budget\nbetween them however requires a careful analysis. Information loss due to\ntexture coding affects the value of pixels in synthesized views while errors in\ndepth information lead to shift in objects or unexpected patterns at their\nboundaries. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation\nbetween textures and depth data of multiview video sequences. We adopt a\nrate-distortion framework based on a simplified model of depth and texture\nimages. Our model preserves the main features of depth and texture images.\nUnlike most recent solutions, our method permits to avoid rendering at encoding\ntime for distortion estimation so that the encoding complexity is not\naugmented. In addition to this, our model is independent of the underlying\ninpainting method that is used at decoder. Experiments confirm our theoretical\nresults and the efficiency of our rate allocation strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 17:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

Thirteen stars in our sample\nhad circumstellar disks previously known from infrared observations at shorter\nwavelengths, while eighteen of them had no previous evidence for a disk. We\ndetect a total of 15 disks as all previously known disks are detected at one or\nmore Herschel wavelengths and two additional disks are identified for the first\ntime. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of our targets seem to trace the\ndissipation of the primordial disk and the transition to the debris disk\nregime. Seven of the 15 disks appear to be optically thick primordial disks,\nincluding two objects with SEDs indistinguishable from those of typical\nClassical T Tauri stars, four objects that have significant deficit of excess\nemission at all IR wavelengths, and one \"pre-transitional\" object with a known\ngap in the disk. Despite their previous WTTS classification, we find that the\nseven targets in our sample with optically thick disks show evidence for\naccretion. The remaining eight disks have weaker IR excesses similar to those\nof optically thin debris disks.

Clarifying the\nrole of the network connectivities for generating cyclic patterns is\nfundamental for understanding the generation of rhythmic movements. In this\npaper, the storage of binary cycles in neural networks is investigated. We call\na cycle $\\Sigma$ admissible if a connectivity matrix satisfying the cycle's\ntransition conditions exists, and construct it using the pseudoinverse learning\nrule.

Simple cycles contain\nrows from one loop only, and the network topology is a feedforward chain with\nfeedback to one neuron if the loop-vectors in $\\Sigma$ are cyclic permutations\nof each other. Composite cycles contain rows from at least two disjoint loops,\nand the neurons corresponding to the rows in $\\Sigma$ from the same loop are\nidentified with a cluster.

Advances in hardware\ntechnology have lead to the increasingly wide spread use of flash storage\ndevices. Such devices have clear benefits over traditional hard drives in terms\nof latency of access, bandwidth and random access capabilities particularly\nwhen reading data. There are however some interesting trade-offs to consider\nwhen leveraging the advanced features of such devices. On a relative scale\nwriting to such devices can be expensive. This is because typical flash devices\n(NAND technology) are updated in blocks. A minor update to a given block\nrequires the entire block to be erased, followed by a re-writing of the block.\nOn the other hand, sequential writes can be two orders of magnitude faster than\nrandom writes. In addition, random writes are degrading to the life of the\nflash drive, since each block can support only a limited number of erasures.\nTF-IDF can be implemented using a counting hash table. In general, hash tables\nare a particularly challenging case for the flash drive because this data\nstructure is inherently dependent upon the randomness of the hash function, as\nopposed to the spatial locality of the data. This makes it difficult to avoid\nthe random writes incurred during the construction of the counting hash table\nfor TF-IDF. In this paper, we will study the design landscape for the\ndevelopment of a hash table for flash storage devices. We demonstrate how to\neffectively design a hash table with two related hash functions, one of which\nexhibits a data placement property with respect to the other. Specifically, we\nfocus on three designs based on this general philosophy and evaluate the\ntrade-offs among them along the axes of query performance, insert and update\ntimes and I/O time through an implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 17:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

PSR\nJ0529-6652 is detectable as a single pulse emitter, with amplitudes that\nclassify the pulses as giant pulses. This makes PSR J0529-6652 the second known\ngiant pulse emitter in the LMC, after PSR B0540-69. The fraction of the emitted\npulses detectable from PSR J0529-6652 at this frequency is roughly two orders\nof magnitude greater than it is for either PSR B0540-69 or the Crab pulsar (if\nthe latter were located in the LMC). We have measured a pulse nulling fraction\nof 83.3 \\pm 1.5% and an intrinsic modulation index of 4.07 \\pm 0.29 for PSR\nJ0529-6652. The modulation index is significantly larger than values previously\nmeasured for typical radio pulsars but is comparable to values reported for\nmembers of several other neutron star classes. The large modulation index,\ngiant pulses, and large nulling fraction suggest that this pulsar is\nphenomenologically more similar to these other, more variable sources, despite\nhaving spin and physical characteristics that are typical of the unrecycled\nradio pulsar population. The large modulation index also does not appear to be\nconsistent with the small value predicted for this pulsar by a model of polar\ncap emission outlined by Gil & Sendyk (2000). This conclusion depends to some\nextent on the assumption that PSR J0529-6652 is exhibiting core emission, as\nsuggested by its simple profile morphology, narrow profile width, and\npreviously measured profile polarization characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 18:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Two types of control, a\ndistributed propor- tional control and a centralized integral control, are cur-\nrently used to keep frequency deviations small. Although generation-load\nimbalance can be very localized, both controls primarily rely on frequency\ndeviation as their in- put. The time scales of control require the outputs of\nthe centralized integral control to be communicated to distant generators every\nfew seconds. We reconsider this con- trol/communication architecture and\nsuggest a hybrid ap- proach that utilizes parameterized feedback policies that\ncan be implemented in a fully distributed manner because the inputs to these\npolicies are local observables at each generator. Using an ensemble of\nforecasts of load and time-intermittent generation representative of possible\nfu- ture scenarios, we perform a centralized off-line stochas- tic optimization\nto select the generator-specific feedback parameters. These parameters need\nonly be communi- cated to generators once per control period (60 minutes in our\nsimulations). We show that inclusion of local power flows as feedback inputs is\ncrucial and reduces frequency deviations by a factor of ten. We demonstrate our\ncon- trol on a detailed transmission model of the Bonneville Power\nAdministration (BPA). Our findings suggest that a smart automatic and\ndistributed control, relying on ad- vanced off-line and system-wide\ncomputations commu- nicated to controlled generators infrequently, may be a\nviable control and communication architecture solution. This architecture is\nsuitable for a future situation when generation-load imbalances are expected to\ngrow because of increased penetration of time-intermittent generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 20:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

Combined with the\nnature of this object's spectral evolution in 2012, a high circumstellar\ndensity and large radiating surface area imply the presence of a thin disk\ngeometry around the central star (and, consequently, a possible binary\ncompanion), suggesting that the observed 2012-B rebrightening of SN 2009ip can\nbe attributed to the illumination of the disk's inner rim by fast-moving ejecta\nproduced by the underlying events of 2012-A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2013 20:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We present images and spectra of SBW1 obtained with HST, Spitzer, and\nGemini South. HST images of SBW1 do not exhibit long Rayleigh-Taylor fingers,\nwhich are presumed to cause the hotspots in the SN1987A ring, but instead show\na geometrically thin clumpy ring. The radial mass distribution and size scales\nof inhomogeneities in SBW1's ring closely resemble those in the SN1987A ring,\nbut the more complete disk expected to reside at the base of the RT fingers is\nabsent. This structure may explain why portions of the SN1987A ring between the\nhotspots have not yet brightened after more than 15 years. The model we suggest\ndoes not require a fast wind colliding with a previous red supergiant wind.\nMore surprisingly, images of SBW1 also reveal diffuse emission filling the\ninterior of the ring in H-alpha and thermal-IR emission; 190K dust dominates\nthe 8-20 micron luminosity (but contains only 1e-5Msun). Cooler (85K dust\nresides in the equatorial ring itself (dust mass of 5e-3Msun). Diffuse emission\nextends inward to 1 arcsecond from the central star, where a paucity of\nemission suggests an inner hole excavated by the wind. We propose that diffuse\nemission inside the ring arises from an ionized flow of material\nphotoevaporated from the dense ring, and it prevents the supergiant wind from\nadvancing in the equator. This inner emission could correspond to a structure\nhypothesized to reside around SN1987A that was never directly detected. We\nsuggest that photoionization can play an important dynamical role in shaping\nthe ring nebula, and we speculate that this might help explain the origin of\nthe polar rings around SN1987A. abridged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 22:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2012 06:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, the determination of\nmetallicities of late-type stars is difficult because visible wavelength\nspectra of their cool atmospheres contain many overlapping absorption lines,\npreventing the measurement of equivalent widths. We present new methods, and\nimproved calibrations of existing methods, to determine metallicities of late-K\nand M dwarfs from moderate resolution (1300 < R < 2000) visible and infrared\nspectra. We select a sample of 112 wide binary systems that contain a late-type\ncompanion to a solar-type primary star. Our sample includes 62 primary stars\nwith previously published metallicities, as well as 50 stars with metallicities\ndetermined from our own observations. We use our sample to empirically\ndetermine which features in the spectrum of the companion are best correlated\nwith the metallicity of the primary. We derive metallicity calibrations for\ndifferent wavelength ranges, and show that it is possible to get metallicities\nreliable to < 0.10 dex using either visible, J, H, or K band spectra. Our\ncalibrations are applicable to dwarfs with metallicities of -1.04 < [Fe/H]<\n+0.56 and spectral types from K7 to M5.

We show that\nalthough this smearing only weakly affects the transmission, it has a large\neffect on the calculated thermopower. Using the theory of open quantum systems\nwe account for both the magnitude of the variations and the qualitative form of\nthe distributions, and show that they arise not only from variations in the\nHOMO-Fermi level offset, but also from variations of the local density of\nstates at the contact point between the molecule and the electrode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 07:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, a Small-World sampler suffers from the\ncurse of dimensionality because its spectral gap depends on the volume of each\nmode. We present a new sampler that combines tempering, Small-World sampling,\nand producing long-range proposals from samples in companion chains (e.g.\nEqui-Energy sampler). In its simplest form the sampler employs two Small-World\nchains: an exploring chain and a sampling chain. The exploring chain samples\n$\\pi_t(x) \\propto \\pi(x)^{1/t}$, $t\\in [1,\\infty)$, and builds up an empirical\ndistribution. Using this empirical distribution as its long-range proposal, the\nsampling chain is designed to have a stationary distribution $\\pi(x)$. We prove\nergodicity of the algorithm and study its convergence rate. We show that the\nspectral gap of the exploring chain is enlarged by a factor of $t^{d}$ and that\nof the sampling chain is shrunk by a factor of $t^{-d}$. Importantly, the\nspectral gap of the exploring chain depends on the \"size\" of $\\pi_t(x)$ while\nthat of sampling chain does not. Overall, the sampler enlarges a severe\nbottleneck at the cost of shrinking a mild one, hence achieves faster mixing.\nThe penalty on the spectral gap of the sampling chain can be significantly\nalleviated when extending the algorithm to multiple chains whose temperatures\n$\\{t_k\\}$ follow a geometric progression.

To further assess the completeness of the results of our method,\nboth MARSIAA, SExtractor, and DetectLSB were applied to search for (i) mock\nVirgo LSB galaxies inserted into a set of deep Next Generation Virgo Survey\n(NGVS) gri-band subimages and (ii) Virgo LSB galaxies identified by eye in a\nfull set of NGVS square degree gri images. MARSIAA/DetectLSB recovered ~20%\nmore mock LSB galaxies and ~40% more LSB galaxies identified by eye than\nSExtractor/DetectLSB. With a 90% fraction of false positives from an entirely\nunsupervised pipeline, a completeness of 90% is reached for sources with r_e >\n3\" at a mean surface brightness level of mu_g=27.7 mag/arcsec^2 and a central\nsurface brightness of mu^0 g=26.7 mag/arcsec^2. About 10% of the false\npositives are artifacts, the rest being background galaxies. We have found our\nmethod to be complementary to the application of matched filters and an\noptimized use of SExtractor, and to have the following advantages: it is\nscale-free, can be applied simultaneously to several bands, and is well adapted\nfor crowded regions on the sky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 08:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The magnetic excitation spectra in them are\ndetermined by the nature of the spin centers, the nature of the magnetic\ninteractions, and the particular arrangement of the mutual interaction paths\nbetween the spin centers. Small clusters of up to four magnetic ions are ideal\nmodel systems to examine the fundamental magnetic interactions which are\nusually dominated by Heisenberg exchange, but often complemented by anisotropic\nand/or higher-order interactions. In large magnetic clusters which may\npotentially deal with a dozen or more spin centers, the possibility of novel\nmany-body quantum states and quantum phenomena are in focus. In this review the\nnecessary theoretical concepts and experimental techniques to study the\nmagnetic cluster excitations and the resulting characteristic magnetic\nproperties are introduced, followed by examples of small clusters demonstrating\nthe enormous amount of detailed physical information which can be retrieved.\nThe current understanding of the excitations and their physical interpretation\nin the molecular nanomagnets which represent large magnetic clusters is then\npresented, with an own section devoted to the subclass of the single-molecule\nmagnets which are distinguished by displaying quantum tunneling of the\nmagnetization. Finally, some quantum many-body states are summarized which\nevolve in magnetic insulators characterized by built-in or field-induced\nmagnetic clusters. The review concludes addressing future perspectives in the\nfield of magnetic cluster excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 08:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The resulting density and mass\nprofiles are proportional to the mass of the gravitating body. The mass profile\nscales with the centripetal acceleration experienced by a test particle\norbiting the central mass; this comes at the cost of postulating a universal\ncharacteristic acceleration a0 = 4.3*10^{-12} m/s^2 (or 8*pi*a0 = 1.1*10^{-10}\nm/s^2).

When the statistics of the output event are known,\nthese input variables have to be chosen in a specific way for the output to\nhave the prescribed statistics. Because the probability distribution of the\ninput random variables is not directly known but dictated implicitly by the\nstatistics of the output random variables, this problem is usually intractable\nfor classical sampling methods.

The model we\nstudy offers a simple representation of a \"cell extract\" comprising, e.g., a\ndroplet of actomyosin solution. (Such extracts are used experimentally to model\nthe cytoskeleton.) Actomyosin is an active gel whose polarity describes the\nmean sense of alignment of actin fibres. In the absence of polymerization and\ndepolymerization processes ('treadmilling'), the gel's dynamics arises solely\nfrom the contractile motion of myosin motors; this should be unchanged when\npolarity is inverted. Our results suggest that motility can arise in the\nabsence of treadmilling, by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of polarity\ninversion symmetry. Adapting our model to wall-bound cells in two dimensions,\nwe find that as wall friction is reduced, treadmilling-induced motility falls\nbut SSB-mediated motility rises. The latter might therefore be crucial in three\ndimensions where frictional forces are likely to be modest. At a supra-cellular\nlevel, the same generic mechanism can impart motility to aggregates of\nnon-motile but active bacteria; we show that SSB in this (extensile) case leads\ngenerically to rotational as well as translational motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 10:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Related previous proposals, such\nas the \"surrogate data\" approach, resampled only the phase of the Fourier\ncoefficients and thus had only limited validity.

To study the SSS state of CNe we carried out a\nhigh-cadence X-ray monitoring of the M 31 central area with XMM-Newton and\nChandra. We analysed X-ray and optical data of a new transient X-ray source in\nthe M 31 GC Bol 126, discovered serendipitously in Swift observations.

In this\npaper we attempted to confirm the candidate SNR [HP99] 1234, identified in\nX-rays with ROSAT, as a true SNR by supplementing these X-ray data with optical\nand radio observations. Optical data from the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line\nSurvey (MCELS) and new radio data from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis\nTelescope (MOST), in addition to the ROSAT X-ray data, were used to perform a\nmorphological analysis of this candidate SNR. An approximately ellipsoidal\nshell of enhanced [SII], typical of an SNR ([SII]/Halpha > 0.4), was detected\nin the optical. This enhancement is coincident with faint radio emission at 36\ncm. Using the available data we estimated the size of the remnant to be ~5.1' x\n4.0' (~75 pc x 59 pc). However, the measurement along the major-axis was\nsomewhat uncertain due to a lack of optical and radio emission at its\nextremities and the poor resolution of the X-ray data. Assuming this SNR is in\nthe Sedov phase and adopting the ambient mass density of 1.2x10^-25 g cm^-3\nmeasured in a nearby HII region, an age estimate of ~25 kyr was calculated for\na canonical initial explosion energy of 10^51 erg. However, this age estimate\nshould be treated cautiously due to uncertainties on the adopted parameters.\nAnalysis of the local stellar population suggested a type Ia event as a\nprecursor to this SNR, however, a core-collapse mechanism could not be ruled\nout due to the possibility of the progenitor being a runaway massive star. With\nthe detection of X-ray, radio and optical line emission with enhanced [SII],\nthis object was confirmed as an SNR and we assign the identifier MCSNR\nJ0527-7104.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 13:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-03"}

In free viewpoint video, each user can periodically select\na virtual view between two anchor camera views for display. The virtual view is\nsynthesized using texture and depth videos of the anchor views via\ndepth-image-based rendering (DIBR). In general, the distortion of the virtual\nview increases with the distance to the anchor views, and hence it is\nbeneficial for a peer to select the closest anchor views for synthesis. On the\nother hand, if peers interested in different virtual views are willing to\ntolerate larger distortion in using more distant anchor views, they can\ncollectively share the access cost of common anchor views.\n  Given anchor view access cost and synthesized distortion of virtual views\nbetween anchor views, we study the optimization of anchor view allocation for\ncollaborative peers. We first show that, if the network reconfiguration costs\ndue to view-switching are negligible, the problem can be optimally solved in\npolynomial time using dynamic programming. We then consider the case of\nnon-negligible reconfiguration costs (e.g., large or frequent view-switching\nleading to anchor-view changes). In this case, the view allocation problem\nbecomes NP-hard. We thus present a locally optimal and centralized allocation\nalgorithm inspired by Lloyd's algorithm in non-uniform scalar quantization. We\nalso propose a distributed algorithm with guaranteed convergence where each\npeer group independently make merge-and-split decisions with a well-defined\nfairness criteria.

Such a class\nof problems, which we call LWR-Emission (LWR-E), has been analyzed before to\ncertain extent. Since mixed integer programs are practically efficient to solve\nin many cases (Bertsimas et al., 2011b), the mere fact of having integer\nvariables is not the most significant challenge to solving LWR-E problems;\nrather, it is the presence of the potentially nonlinear and nonconvex\nemission-related constraints/objectives that render the program computationally\nexpensive. To address this computational challenge, we proposed a novel\nreformulation of the LWR-E problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP).\nThis approach relies on the existence of a statistically valid macroscopic\nrelationship between the aggregate emission rate and the vehicle occupancy of\nthe same link. This relationship is approximated with certain functional forms\nand the associated uncertainties are handled explicitly using robust\noptimization (RO) techniques. The RO allows emissions-related constraints\nand/or objectives to be reformulated as linear forms under mild conditions. To\nfurther reduce the computational cost, we employ the link transmission model to\ndescribe traffic dynamics with the benefit of fewer (integer) variables and\nless potential traffic holding.
