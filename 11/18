The method enables to find\nnontrivial fixed points in quantum field theoretic models which make them free\nfrom divergences and leads to the concept of asymptotic safety. It can be\nconsidered as a generalization of the asymptotic freedom which plays a key role\nin the perturbative renormalization. We summarize and give a short discussion\nof some important models, which are asymptotically safe such as the Gross-Neveu\nmodel, the nonlinear $\\sigma$ model, the sine-Gordon model, and we consider the\nmodel of quantum Einstein gravity which seems to show asymptotic safety, too.\nWe also give a detailed analysis of infrared behavior of such scalar models\nwhere a spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place. The deep infrared behaviorof\nthe broken phase cannot be treated within the framework of perturbative\ncalculations. We demonstrate that there exists an infrared fixed point in the\nbroken phase whichcreates a new scaling regime there, however its structure is\nhidden by the singularity of the renormalization group equations. The theory\nspaces of these models show several similar properties, namely the models have\nthe same phase and fixed point structure. The quantum Einstein gravity also\nexhibits similarities when considering the global aspects of its theory space\nsince the appearing two phases there show analogies with the symmetric and the\nbroken phases of the scalar models.

However, many questions remain\nabout the true magnitude of the energy flux carried by these waves. Here we\nexplore the apparent discrepancy in the resolved coronal Alfvenic wave\namplitude (~0.5km/s) measured by the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP)\ncompared to those of the Hinode and the SDO near the limb (~20km/s). We use a\nblend of observational data and a simple forward model of Alfvenic wave\npropagation to resolve this discrepancy and determine the Alfvenic wave energy\ncontent of the corona. Our results indicate that enormous line-of-sight\nsuperposition within the coarse spatio-temporal sampling of CoMP hides the\nstrong wave flux observed by Hinode and SDO and leads to the large non-thermal\nline broadening observed. While this scenario has been assumed in the past, our\nobservations with CoMP of a strong correlation between the non-thermal line\nbroadening with the low amplitude, low frequency Alfvenic waves observed in the\ncorona provide the first direct evidence of a wave-related non-thermal line\nbroadening.

It has been shown to\nincrease network throughput compared to traditional networks implementation, to\nreduce delay and to provide robustness to transmission errors and network\ndynamics.

The magnetic penetration depth \\lambda, the coherence length \\xi,\nand the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \\kappa are evaluated. The temperature\ndependence of the superfluid density is well described by an s-wave\nsuperconducting gap and this classical scenario is supported by the\nfield-independent \\lambda. The gap-to-Tc ratio \\Delta/kTc increases with the Au\ncontent from 1.70 for x = 0 to 2.1(1) for x = 1. By combining muSR,\nmagnetization, and specific heat data, we find that BaPt(4-x)Au(x)Ge12\ncompounds are in between the dirty and clean limits with mean free paths of the\ncarriers l ~ \\xi.

However, unfortunately especially in third world countries,\neducation cannot be achieved due to, lack of inorganic and organic resources.\nHowever, many third world countries have embraced the concepts such as One\nLaptop per Child, facilitating the students to learn. The effective adaptation\nof these concepts has being launched through many government and non-government\nprojects, providing inorganic resources. However, inorganic resources alone\ncannot provide quality education, as learning needs assessment procedures,\nfeedback generators and trainers who could guide the students to gain\nknowledge.
