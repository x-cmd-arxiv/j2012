This simple system displays a\nrich and complex behavior: as the core width is varied, this system is\ncharacterized by two peculiar transitions where, for different reasons, it\ndisplays characteristics similar to a few-particle quantum phase transition.\nThe first occurrence corresponds to something akin to a second order quantum\nphase transition, while the second transition is marked by a discontinuity,\nwith respect to the driving parameter, in the first derivatives of quantities\nlike energy and entanglement. The study of this system allows to shed light on\nthe sudden variation of entanglement and energy observed in S. Abdullah et al.\n[Phys. Rev. B 80, 235302 (2009)].

The threads are the principal\ncontributors to the total mass. The total prominence mass is in agreement with\nobservations, assuming a reasonable filling factor. The motion of the threads\nis basically horizontal, while blobs move in all directions along the field.\nThe peak velocities for both populations are comparable. We have generated\nsynthetic images of the whole structure in an H$\\alpha$ proxy and in two EUV\nchannels of the AIA instrument aboard SDO, thus showing the plasma at cool,\nwarm, and hot temperatures. The predicted differential emission measure of our\nsystem agrees very well with observations. We conclude that the sheared-arcade\nmagnetic structure and plasma behavior driven by thermal nonequilibrium fit\nwell the abundant observational evidence for typical intermediate prominences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 16:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Disks are composed of either fluffy\ncarbon and silicate grains of various sizes or dust of the diffuse ISM. The IR\nemission and the midplane temperature derived by the MC method differ from\nmodels where the radiative transfer is solved in slab geometry of small ring\nsegments. In the MC treatment, dusty halos above the disks are considered.\nHalos lead to an enhanced IR emission and warmer midplane temperature than do\npure disks. Under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium we find that the\ndisk in the inner rim puffs up, followed by a shadowed region. The shadow\nreduces the temperature of the midplane and decreases the height of the\nextinction layer of the disk. It can be seen as a gap in the disk unless the\nsurface is again exposed to direct stellar radiation. There the disk puffs up a\nsecond time, a third time and so forth. Therefore several gaps and ring-like\nstructures are present in the disk surface and appear in emission images. They\nresult from shadows in the disks and are present without the need to postulate\nthe existence of any companion or planet.

The annihilation gamma spectra characterise\nthe momentum distribution of the electron-positron pair at the instant of\nannihilation. The contribution to the gamma spectra from individual molecular\norbitals is obtained from electron momentum densities calculated using modern\ncomputational quantum chemistry density functional theory tools. The\ncalculation, in its simplest form, effectively treats the low-energy\n(thermalised, room-temperature) positron as a plane wave and gives annihilation\ngamma spectra that are about 40% broader than experiment, although the main\nchemical trends are reproduced. We show that this effective \"narrowing\" of the\nexperimental spectra is due to the action of the molecular potential on the\npositron, chiefly, due to the positron repulsion from the nuclei. It leads to a\nsuppression of the contribution of small positron-nuclear separations where the\nelectron momentum is large. To investigate the effect of the nuclear repulsion,\nas well as that of short-range electron-positron and positron-molecule\ncorrelations, a linear combination of atomic orbital description of the\nmolecular orbitals is employed. It facilitates the incorporation of correction\nfactors which can be calculated from atomic many-body theory and account for\nthe repulsion and correlations. Their inclusion in the calculation gives gamma\nspectrum linewidths that are in much better agreement with experiment.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the effective distortion of the electron momentum\ndensity, when it is observed through positron annihilation gamma spectra, can\nbe approximated by a relatively simple scaling factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 18:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-18"}

In the limit as the\npenalty constant tends to $\\infty$, one recovers the constrained solution. In\nthe exact penalty method, squared penalties are replaced by absolute value\npenalties, and the solution is recovered for a finite value of the penalty\nconstant. In practice, the kinks in the penalty and the unknown magnitude of\nthe penalty constant prevent wide application of the exact penalty method in\nnonlinear programming. In this article, we examine a strategy of path following\nconsistent with the exact penalty method. Instead of performing optimization at\na single penalty constant, we trace the solution as a continuous function of\nthe penalty constant. Thus, path following starts at the unconstrained solution\nand follows the solution path as the penalty constant increases. In the\nprocess, the solution path hits, slides along, and exits from the various\nconstraints. For quadratic programming, the solution path is piecewise linear\nand takes large jumps from constraint to constraint. For a general convex\nprogram, the solution path is piecewise smooth, and path following operates by\nnumerically solving an ordinary differential equation segment by segment. Our\ndiverse applications to a) projection onto a convex set, b) nonnegative least\nsquares, c) quadratically constrained quadratic programming, d) geometric\nprogramming, and e) semidefinite programming illustrate the mechanics and\npotential of path following. The final detour to image denoising demonstrates\nthe relevance of path following to regularized estimation in inverse problems.\nIn regularized estimation, one follows the solution path as the penalty\nconstant decreases from a large value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 18:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-18"}

This is however unstable under time evolution, we provide\nproofs under several sets of assumptions. In the simplest model galaxies are\ncreated locally and linearly biased at a single time, and subsequently move\nwith the matter (no velocity bias) conserving their comoving number density (no\nmerging). We show that, after this formation time, the bias becomes unavoidably\nnon-local and non-linear at large scales. We identify the non-local\ngravitationally induced fields in which the galaxy overdensity can be expanded,\nshowing that they can be constructed out of the invariants of the deformation\ntensor (Galileons). In addition, we show that this result persists if we\ninclude an arbitrary evolution of the comoving number density of tracers. We\nthen include velocity bias, and show that new contributions appear, a dipole\nfield being the signature at second order. We test these predictions by\nstudying the dependence of halo overdensities in cells of fixed matter density:\nmeasurements in simulations show that departures from the mean bias relation\nare strongly correlated with the non-local gravitationally induced fields\nidentified by our formalism. The effects on non-local bias seen in the\nsimulations are most important for the most biased halos, as expected from our\npredictions. The non-locality seen in the simulations is not fully captured by\nassuming local bias in Lagrangian space. Accounting for these effects when\nmodeling galaxy bias is essential for correctly describing the dependence on\ntriangle shape of the galaxy bispectrum, and hence constraining cosmological\nparameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that using our formalism we\nremove an important systematic in the determination of bias parameters from the\ngalaxy bispectrum, particularly for luminous galaxies.

We previously showed that the dynamics of the\ngiant planets introduces a correlation between the presence of terrestrial\nplanets and debris disks. Here we present new simulations that show that this\nconnection is qualitatively robust to changes in: the mass distribution of the\ngiant planets, the width and mass distribution of the outer planetesimal disk,\nand the presence of gas in the disk. We discuss how variations in these\nparameters affect the evolution. Systems with equal-mass giant planets undergo\nthe most violent instabilities, and these destroy both terrestrial planets and\nthe outer planetesimal disks that produce debris disks. In contrast, systems\nwith low-mass giant planets efficiently produce both terrestrial planets and\ndebris disks. A large fraction of systems with low-mass outermost giant planets\nhave stable gaps between these planets that are frequently populated by\nplanetesimals. Planetesimal belts between outer giant planets may affect debris\ndisk SEDs. If Earth-mass seeds are present in outer planetesimal disks, the\ndisks radially spread to colder temperatures. We argue that this may explain\nthe very low frequency of > 1 Gyr-old solar-type stars with observed 24 micron\nexcesses. Among the (limited) set of configurations explored, the best\ncandidates for hosting terrestrial planets at ~1 AU are stars older than 0.1-1\nGyr with bright debris disks at 70 micron but with no currently-known giant\nplanets.

We find that the H2 mass fraction,\n(f_H2), depends on three main LAE physical properties: (a) star formation rate,\n(b) dust mass, and (c) cold neutral gas mass. At z~5.7, the value of f_H2 peaks\nand ranges between 0.5-0.9 for intermediate mass LAEs with stellar mass M_* ~\n10^{9-10} solar mass, decreasing for both smaller and larger galaxies. However,\nthe largest value of the H2 mass is found in the most luminous LAEs. These\ntrends also hold at z\\sim6.6, although, due to a lower dust content,\nf_H2(z=6.6)\\sim0.5 f_H2(z=5.7) when averaged over all LAEs; they arise due to\nthe interplay between the H2 formation/shielding controlled by dust and the\nintensity of the ultraviolet (UV) Lyman-Werner photo-dissociating radiation\nproduced by stars.

SNRs are usually computed from a\nsensitivity curve, which describes the gravitational-wave amplitude needed by a\nmonochromatic source of given frequency to achieve a threshold SNR. For\ninterferometric space-based detectors similar to LISA, which are sensitive to\nlong-lived signals and have constantly changing position and orientation, exact\nSNRs need to be computed on a source-by-source basis. For convenience, most\nauthors prefer to work with sky-averaged sensitivities, accepting inaccurate\nSNRs for individual sources and giving up control over the statistical\ndistribution of SNRs for source populations. In this paper, we describe a\nstraightforward end-to-end recipe to compute the non-sky-averaged sensitivity\nof interferometric space-based detectors of any geometry: in effect, we derive\nerror bars for the sky-averaged sensitivity curve, which provide a stringent\nstatistical interpretation for previously unqualified statements about\nsky-averaged SNRs. As a worked-out example, we consider isotropic and\nGalactic-disk populations of monochromatic sources, as observed with the\n\"classic LISA\" configuration. We confirm that the (standard) inverse-rms\naverage sensitivity for the isotropic population remains the same whether or\nnot the LISA orbits are included in the computation. However, detector motion\ntightens the distribution of sensitivities, so for 50% of sources the\nsensitivity is within 30% of its average. For the Galactic-disk population, the\naverage and the distribution of the sensitivity for a moving detector turn out\nto be similar to the isotropic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2012 02:24:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 20:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

However, during the later stage of the EOR, a large portion of the\nionizing photons are consumed by recombination inside the minihalos, where the\ngas has higher density and recombination rates than the gas in the IGM. The\nsuppression of small scale structure would therefore reduce the recombination\nrate, and could potentially shorten the reionization process.

We\nfocus on two mechanisms for the formation of BHs at high redshifts: as\nend-products of (1) Population III stars in metal free halos, and of (2)\nrunaway stellar collisions in metal poor NCs. Our model tracks the chemical,\nradiative and mechanical feedback of stars on the baryonic component of the\nevolving halos. This procedure allows us to evaluate when and where the\nconditions for BH formation are met, and to trace the emergence of BH seeds\narising from the dynamical channel, in a cosmological context. BHs start to\nappear already at z~30 as remnants of Population III stars. The efficiency of\nthis mechanism begins decreasing once feedbacks become increasingly important.\nAround redshift z~15, BHs mostly form in the centre of mildly metal enriched\nhalos inside dense NCs. The seed BHs that form along the two pathways have at\nbirth a mass around 100-1000M\\odot. The occupation fraction of BHs is a\nfunction of both halo mass and mass growth rate: at a given z, heavier and\nfaster growing halos have a higher chance to form a native BH, or to acquire an\ninherited BH via merging of another system. With decreasing z, the probability\nof finding a BH shifts toward progressively higher mass halo intervals. This is\ndue to the fact that, at later cosmic times, low mass systems rarely form a\nseed, and already formed BHs are deposited into larger mass systems due to\nhierarchical mergers. Our model predict that at z=0, all halos above\n10^11M\\odot should host a BH (in agreement with observational results), most\nprobably inherited during their lifetime.

However, parallelism in irregular\nalgorithms is very complex. In a regular algorithm like dense matrix\nmultiplication, the amount of parallelism can usually be expressed as a\nfunction of the problem size, so it is reasonably straightforward to determine\nhow many processors should be allocated to execute a regular algorithm of a\ncertain size (this is called the processor allocation problem). In contrast,\nparallelism in irregular algorithms can be a function of input parameters, and\nthe amount of parallelism can vary dramatically during the execution of the\nirregular algorithm. Therefore, the processor allocation problem for irregular\nalgorithms is very difficult.\n  In this paper, we describe the first systematic strategy for addressing this\nproblem. Our approach is based on a construct called the conflict graph, which\n(i) provides insight into the amount of parallelism that can be extracted from\nan irregular algorithm, and (ii) can be used to address the processor\nallocation problem for irregular algorithms. We show that this problem is\nrelated to a generalization of the unfriendly seating problem and, by extending\nTur\\'an's theorem, we obtain a worst-case class of problems for optimistic\nparallelization, which we use to derive a lower bound on the exploitable\nparallelism. Finally, using some theoretically derived properties and some\nexperimental facts, we design a quick and stable control strategy for solving\nthe processor allocation problem heuristically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2012 13:16:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 13:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}

It is central to routine estimation of DA white dwarf masses\nderived from spectroscopic temperatures and gravities. It is also the basis for\nobservational determinations of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation.\nNevertheless, definitive and detailed observational confirmations of the\nmass-radius relation (MRR) remain elusive due to a lack of sufficiently\naccurate white dwarf masses and radii. Current best estimates of masses and\nradii allow only broad conclusions about the expected inverse relation between\nmasses and radii in degenerate stars. In this paper we examine a restricted set\nof 12 DA white dwarf binary systems for which accurate (1) trigonometric\nparallaxes, (2) spectroscopic effective temperatures and gravities, and (3)\ngravitational redshifts are available.
