Although analysis of images taken by the Hubble Space\nTelescope and Rosetta spacecraft suggested that the dust tail resulted from a\nrecent head-on collision between asteroids (Jewitt et al. 2010; Snodgrass et\nal. 2010), an alternative idea of ice sublimation was suggested based on the\nmorphological fitting of ground-based images (Moreno et al. 2010). Here, we\nreport a multiband observation of P/2010 A2 made on January 2010 with a 105 cm\ntelescope at the Ishigakijima Astronomical Observatory. Three broadband\nfilters, $g'$, $R_c$, and $I_c$, were employed for the observation. The unique\nmultiband data reveals that the reflectance spectrum of the P/2010 A2 dust tail\nresembles that of an Sq-type asteroid or that of ordinary chondrites rather\nthan that of an S-type asteroid. Due to the large error of the measurement, the\nreflectance spectrum also resembles the spectra of C-type asteroids, even\nthough C-type asteroids are uncommon in the Flora family. The reflectances\nrelative to the $g'$-band (470 nm) are 1.096$\\pm$0.046 at the $R_c$-band (650\nnm) and 1.131$\\pm$0.061 at the $I_c$-band (800 nm). We hypothesize that the\nparent body of P/2010 A2 was originally S-type but was then shattered upon\ncollision into scaterring fresh chondritic particles from the interior, thus\nforming the dust tail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2012 17:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We\nselect a total of 6781 stars, using a selection of colour, surface gravity and\nuncertainty in the derived space motion, and calculate for each star a\nprobabilistic (kinematic) population assignment to a thin or thick disc using\nspace motion and additionally another (dynamical) assignment using stellar\nvertical orbital eccentricity. We derive almost equal metallicity gradients as\na function of Galactocentric distance for the high probability thin disc stars\nand for stars with vertical orbital eccentricities consistent with being\ndynamically young, e_v<=0.07, i.e. d[M/H]/dR_m = -0.041(0.003) and d[M/H]/dR_m\n= -0.041(0.007) dex/kpc. Metallicity gradients as a function of distance from\nthe Galactic plane for the same populations are steeper, i.e. d[M/H]/dz_{max} =\n-0.109(0.008) and d[M/H]/dz_{max} = -0.260(0.031) dex/kpc, respectively. R_m\nand z_{max} are the arithmetic mean of the perigalactic and apogalactic\ndistances, and the maximum distance to the Galactic plane, respectively.\nSamples including more thick disc red clump giant stars show systematically\nshallower abundance gradients. These findings can be used to distinguish\nbetween different formation scenarios of the thick and thin discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2012 06:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This protocol has received a\nsignificant amount of attention dating back to the papers of Tassiulas and\nEphremides. In particular, this protocol is known to be throughput-optimal\nwhenever the traffic patterns and propagation conditions are governed by a\nstationary stochastic process.\n  However, the standard proof of throughput optimality (which is based on the\nnegative drift of a quadratic potential function) does not hold when the\ntraffic patterns and the edge capacity changes over time are governed by an\narbitrary adversarial process. Such an environment appears frequently in many\npractical wireless scenarios when the assumption that channel conditions are\ngoverned by a stationary stochastic process does not readily apply.\n  In this paper we prove that even in the above adversarial setting, the\nMax-Weight protocol keeps the queues in the network stable (i.e. keeps the\nqueue sizes bounded) whenever this is feasible by some routing and scheduling\nalgorithm. However, the proof is somewhat more complex than the negative\npotential drift argument that applied in the stationary case. Our proof holds\nfor any arbitrary interference relationships among edges. We also prove the\nstability of $\\ep$-approximate Max-Weight under the adversarial model. We\nconclude the paper with a discussion of queue sizes in the adversarial model as\nwell as a set of simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2012 07:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-17"}

However, perfect CSI at the users is an unrealistic assumption in the\nwireless scenario, as it would involve massive feedback overheads. In this\npaper we propose a scheme which uses only quantized knowledge of CSI at the\ntransmitters with the overhead being nominal. The users rotate their\nconstellation without varying their transmit power to adapt to the existing\nchannel conditions, in order to meet certain pre-determined minimum Euclidean\ndistance requirement in the equivalent constellation at the destination. The\noptimal modulation scheme has been described for the case when both the users\nuse symmetric M-PSK constellations at the input, where $ M=2^\\lambda $, $\n\\lambda $ being a positive integer. The strategy has been illustrated by\nconsidering examples where both users use QPSK or 8-PSK signal sets at the\ninput. It is shown that the proposed scheme has better throughput and error\nperformance compared to the conventional non-adaptive scheme, at the cost of a\nfeedback overhead of just $\\lceil \\log_2(\\frac{M^2}{8}-\\frac{M}{4}+2)\\rceil + 1\n$ bits, for the M-PSK case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2012 13:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-17"}

[Math. Models. Meth. Appl. Sci., 18, Suppl. (2008), pp.\n1249--1267]. Such patterns, characterized by the concentration of criminal\nactivity in localized spatial regions, are referred to as hot-spot patterns and\nthey occur in a parameter regime far from the Turing point associated with the\nbifurcation of spatially uniform solutions. Singular perturbation techniques\nare used to construct steady-state hot-spot patterns in one and two-dimensional\nspatial domains, and new types of nonlocal eigenvalue problems are derived that\ndetermine the stability of these hot-spot patterns to ${\\mathcal O}(1)$\ntime-scale instabilities. From an analysis of these nonlocal eigenvalue\nproblems, a critical threshold $K_c$ is determined such that a pattern\nconsisting of $K$ hot-spots is unstable to a competition instability if\n$K>K_c$. This instability, due to a positive real eigenvalue, triggers the\ncollapse of some of the hot-spots in the pattern. Furthermore, in contrast to\nthe well-known stability results for spike patterns of the Gierer-Meinhardt\nreaction-diffusion model, it is shown for the crime model that there is only a\nrelatively narrow parameter range where oscillatory instabilities in the\nhot-spot amplitudes occur. Such an instability, due to a Hopf bifurcation, is\nstudied explicitly for a single hot-spot in the shadow system limit, for which\nthe diffusivity of criminals is asymptotically large. Finally, the parameter\nregime where localized hot-spots occur is compared with the parameter regime,\nstudied in previous works, where Turing instabilities from a spatially uniform\nsteady-state occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2012 14:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-17"}

Such problems can be tackled by using vertex cover as a parameter,\nhowever this places severe restrictions on admissible graph classes.\n  Michael Lampis has recently introduced neighborhood diversity, a new graph\nparameter which generalizes vertex cover to dense graphs. Among other results,\nhe has shown that simple parameterized algorithms exist for a few problems on\ngraphs of bounded neighborhood diversity.
