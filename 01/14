Spectra during long-duration flares with steady declines were selected,\nwith an isothermal assumption and improved data analysis methods over previous\nwork. Two spectral fitting models give comparable results, viz. an iron\nabundance that is lower than previous coronal values but higher than\nphotospheric values. In the preferred method, the estimated Fe abundance is\n$A({\\rm Fe}) = 7.91 \\pm 0.10$ (on a logarithmic scale, with $A({\\rm H}) = 12$),\nor $2.6 \\pm 0.6$ times the photospheric Fe abundance.

This argues for a fractionation mechanism similar\nto quiet-Sun plasma.

Combining those with\nmultiple views of the same patch of sky (e.g., in the Chandra and XMM-Newton\ndeep fields) so as to extend variability studies over longer baselines, the\nspectral timing capacity of X-ray observatories then stretch over 10 orders of\nmagnitude at spatial resolutions of arcseconds, and 13 orders of magnitude at\nspatial resolutions of a degree. A wealth of high-energy time-domain data\nalready exists, and indicates variability on timescales ranging from\nmicroseconds to years in a wide variety of objects, including numerous classes\nof AGN, high-energy phenomena at the Galactic centre, Galactic and\nextra-Galactic X-ray binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, stellar flares,\ntidal disruption flares, and as-yet unknown X-ray variables.

An induction-reaction two-step\nchain-branching model is used to study the coupling between the energy release\nand the compressible hydrodynamics occurring during the shock ignition\ntransient leading to a detonation. Owing to the model's simplicity, the\nignition and acceleration mechanism is explained using the two families of\ncharacteristics admitted by the model. The energy release along the particle\npaths provides the amplification of forward-travelling pressure waves. These\nwaves pre-compress the medium in the induction layer ahead of the reaction\nzone, therefore changing the induction delays of successive particles. The\nvariation of the induction delay provides the modulation of the amplification\nof the forward travelling pressure waves by controlling the residence time of\nthe pressure waves in the reaction zone. A closed form analytical solution is\nobtained by the method of characteristics and high activation energy\nasymptotics. The acceleration of the reaction zone was found to be proportional\nto the product of the activation energy, the ratio of the induction to reaction\ntime and the heat release. This finding provides a theoretical justification\nfor the previous use of this non-dimensional number to characterize the\nignition regimes observed experimentally in detonations and shock induced\nignition phenomena. Numerical simulations are presented and analysed. Both\nsubsonic and supersonic internal flame propagation regimes are observed,\nconsistent with experiment and previous reactive Euler models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 18:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-16"}

For the subset of 13\nobjects in our dataset that excludes the highly reddened and fast declining SNe\nIa, and includes only those objects for which NIR observations began prior to\nfive days after maximum light, we find modest evidence for a peak\nluminosity-decline rate relation in Y, and stronger evidence in J and H. Using\nRv values differing from the canonical value of 3.1 is shown to have little\neffect on the results. A Hubble diagram is presented for the NIR bands and the\nB band. The resulting scatter for the combined NIR bands is 0.13 mag, while the\nB band produces a scatter of 0.22 mag. The data suggest that applying a\ncorrection to SNe Ia peak luminosities for decline rate is likely to be\nbeneficial in the J and H bands to make SNe Ia more precise distance\nindicators, but of only marginal importance in the Y band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 18:50:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Mar 2012 15:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

At low Pe number the pair\ncorrelation functions are close to their equilibrium values, but as the Pe\nnumber increases, important deviations from equilibrium forms are observed.\nAlthough the attractive forces we employ are not strong enough to form\npermanent clusters, they do induce transient clusters whose behaviour is also\naffected by Pe number.

Instead, the change in cluster distribution occurs because larger\nclusters are less likely to form with increasing Pe number.

New particles\nwith color, if within the LHC energy reach, will be copiously produced. One\nsuch particle is a diquark, having the quantum numbers of two quarks, and can\nbe a scalar or a vector. It will decay to two light quarks, or two top quarks,\nor a top and a light quark, (up or down type depending on the quantum number of\nthe produced diquark).

In this work, we consider a color sextet vector diquark having the\nquantum number of (ud) type, its resonance production, and the subsequent decay\nto tb, giving rise to excess contribution to the single top production. Even\nthough the diquark mass is large, its strong resonance production dominate the\nweak production of tb for a wide range of the diquark mass. Also its subsequent\ndecay to tb produce a very hard b-jet compared to the usual electroweak\nproduction.

In this paper, we build\nincentives schemes based on social norms. Social norms prescribe a social\nstrategy for the users in the system to follow and deploy reputation schemes to\nreward or penalize users depending on their behaviors. Because users in these\nsystems often have only limited capability to observe the global system\ninformation, e.g. the reputation distribution of the users participating in the\nsystem, their beliefs about the reputation distribution are heterogeneous and\nbiased. Such belief heterogeneity causes a positive fraction of users to not\nfollow the social strategy. In such practical scenarios, the standard\nequilibrium analysis deployed in the economics literature is no longer directly\napplicable and hence, the system design needs to consider these differences. To\ninvestigate how the system designs need to change when the participating users\nhave only limited observations, we focus on a simple social norm with binary\nreputation labels but allow adjusting the punishment severity through\nrandomization. First, we model the belief heterogeneity using a suitable\nBayesian belief function. Next, we formalize the users' optimal decision\nproblems and derive in which scenarios they follow the prescribed social\nstrategy. With this result, we then study the system dynamics and formally\ndefine equilibrium in the sense that the system is stable when users\nstrategically optimize their decisions. By rigorously studying two specific\ncases where users' belief distribution is constant or is linearly influenced by\nthe true reputation distribution, we prove that the optimal reputation update\nrule is to choose the mildest possible punishment. This result is further\nconfirmed for higher order beliefs in simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 19:12:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2012 03:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

In this thesis we extend the well-established\nand successful zero temperature framework of Non-Relativistic (NR) Effective\nField Theories (EFTs) (NRQCD, pNRQCD) for the study of heavy quarkonia\n(production, spectroscopy, decays, ...) to finite temperatures. This is\nachieved by integrating out in sequence the scales that characterize a NR bound\nstate and those that are typical of a thermal medium, in the possible\nhierarchies that are relevant for quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma. Within\nthis framework we show how the potential that governs the evolution of the\nquark-antiquark pair is derived from QCD in a modern and rigorous way, thereby\nbridging the gap between phenomenological potential models and QCD. We show how\nthe EFTs can be systematically improved and how effects that cannot be encoded\nin a potential arise naturally in the EFT, giving rise to new mechanisms of\ndissociation. We use this EFT framework to compute the spectrum and width of\nquarkonia in a particular setting that is relevant for the phenomenology of the\nground states of bottomonium at the LHC. We also analyze within this framework\nthe correlator of Polyakov loops, which is related to the thermodynamical free\nenergy of heavy quark-antiquark pairs in the medium. As such, lattice\ncomputations thereof were frequently used as input for potential models.

Different\nfrom the conventional 'topological observability' based approaches, this paper\nadvocates a much more refined, information-theoretic criterion, namely the\nmutual information (MI) between the PMU measurements and the power system\nstates. The proposed MI criterion can not only include the full system\nobservability as a special case, but also can rigorously model the remaining\nuncertainties in the power system states with PMU measurements, so as to\ngenerate highly informative PMU configurations. Further, the MI criterion can\nfacilitate robust PMU placement by explicitly modeling probabilistic PMU\noutages. We propose a greedy PMU placement algorithm, and show that it achieves\nan approximation ratio of (1-1/e) for any PMU placement budget.

Such\nperformance guarantee makes the greedy algorithm very attractive in the\npractical scenario of multi-stage installations for utilities with limited\nbudgets.

We identify which stellar populations are responsible for\nmost of the 12um emission. We find that most (~80%) of the 12um emission in SF\ngalaxies is produced by stellar populations younger than 0.6 Gyr. In contrast,\nthe 12um emission in weak AGN (L[OIII]<10^7 L_sun) is produced by older stars,\nwith ages of ~1-3 Gyr. We find that L_[12um] linearly correlates with stellar\nmass for SF galaxies. At fixed 12um luminosity, weak AGN deviate toward higher\nmasses since they tend to be hosted by massive, early-type galaxies with older\nstellar populations. Star-forming galaxies and weak AGN follow different\nL_[12um]-SFR (star formation rate) relations, with weak AGN showing excess 12um\nemission at low SFR (~0.02-1 M_sun/yr). This is likely due to dust grains\nheated by older stars. While the specific star formation rate (SSFR) of SF\ngalaxies is nearly constant, the SSFR of weak AGN decreases by ~3 orders of\nmagnitude, reflecting the very different star formation efficiencies between SF\ngalaxies and massive, early-type galaxies. Stronger type II AGN in our sample\n(L_[OIII]>10^7 L_sun), act as an extension of massive SF galaxies, connecting\nthe SF and weak AGN sequences. This suggests a picture where galaxies form\nstars normally until an AGN (possibly after a starburst episode) starts to\ngradually quench the SF activity.

We construct visible to MIR spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of cluster galaxies and use them to measure stellar masses\nand SFRs in eight low redshift clusters, which we examine as a function of\nenvironment. A partial correlation analysis indicates that SFR depends strongly\non R/R200 (>99.9% confidence) and is independent of projected local density at\nfixed radius. SFR also shows no residual dependence on stellar mass. We\ntherefore conclude that interactions with the intra-cluster medium drive the\nevolution of SFRs in cluster galaxies. A merged sample of galaxies from the\nfive most complete clusters shows <SFR>\\propto(R/R200)^(1.3+/-0.7) for galaxies\nwith R/R200<0.4. A decline in the fraction of SFGs toward the cluster center\ncontributes most of this effect, but it is accompanied by a reduction in SFRs\namong star-forming galaxies (SFGs) near the cluster center. The increase in the\nfraction of SFGs toward larger R/R200 and the isolation of SFGs with reduced\nSFRs near the cluster center are consistent with ram pressure stripping as the\nmechanism to truncate star formation in galaxy clusters. We conclude that\nstripping drives the properties of SFGs over the range of radii we examine.

Radio and millimeter wave astronomers depend on\ninterferometry to achieve image quality on par with conventional visible and\ninfrared telescopes.

The full - temperature range superfluid\ndensity, $\\rho_s(T) = (\\lambda(0)/\\lambda(T))^2$, at the optimal doping is also\ndistinctly different from other charge - doped FeSCs but is similar to\nisovalently - substituted BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, believed to be a nodal\npnictide at the optimal doping.

The second section deals with the methods, the computer programs and\nthe results of the phase shift analysis of elastic scattering in the p3He,\np6Li, p12C, n12C, p13C, 4He4He and 4He12C nuclear systems at low and ultralow\nenergies. The results obtained on the basis of three-body models of certain\nlight atomic nuclei are given in the third section, notably the 7Li, 9Be and\n11B nuclei which are used for examination of the conjugated intercluster\npotentials determined on the basis of the phase shifts of elastic scattering\nand using then in the nuclear astrophysics problems connected with the\ndescription of the thermonuclear processes in the Universe. The book will be\nuseful for advanced students, postgraduate students and PhD doctoral candidates\nin universities and research institutes in the field of astrophysics and\nnuclear physics. The book is presented in Russian with a few inserts into\nEnglish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2012 09:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 06:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-18"}

Stochastic differential equations of fractional order driven by\nsingle or multiple fractional Gaussian noise terms are introduced to describe\nretarding and accelerating subdiffusion and superdiffusion. Short and long time\nasymptotic limits of the mean squared displacement of the stochastic processes\nassociated with the solutions of these equations are studied. Specific cases of\nthese equations are shown to provide possible descriptions of retarding or\naccelerating anomalous diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2012 15:27:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 07:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

Active functionalisation, either\nthrough added gain or nonlinearity, is mostly possible through the integration\nof active materials3, 4. The high temperatures used in manufacturing of silica\nwaveguides, unfortunately, make it impossible to presently integrate many\norganic and inorganic species critical to achieving this extended\nfunctionality.
