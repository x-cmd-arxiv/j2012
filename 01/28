In this case we exploit the\nrare fact that the PT-deformation can be provided by an explicit map found by\nCurtright and Fairlie together with the property that the undeformed equation\ncan be solved by the method of characteristics. We generalise the map and\nobserve this type of behaviour for all integer values of the deformation\nparameter epsilon. The peaks are formed as a result of mapping the multi-valued\nself-avoiding shock profile to a multi-valued self-crossing function by means\nof the PT-deformation.

We sketch the sparse resultant constructions of Canny and Emiris and\nshow how they reduce the problem of root-finding to an eigenproblem. A novel\nmethod for achieving this reduction is presented which does not increase the\ndimension of the problem. Together with an implementation of the sparse\nresultant construction, it provides a general solver for polynomial systems.

Deconvolving\nthe two effects is an important current effort in astrophysics. Observed\nproperties of a sample of isolated galaxies should be largely the result of\ninternal (natural) evolution. It follows that nurture-induced galaxy evolution\ncan only be understood through comparative study of galaxies in different\nenvironments. We take a first look at SDSS (g-r) colors of galaxies in the\nAMIGA sample involving many of the most isolated galaxies in the local\nUniverse. This leads us to simultaneously consider the pitfalls of using\nautomated SDSS colors. We focus on median values for the principal\nmorphological subtypes found in the AMIGA sample (E/S0 and Sb-Sc) and compare\nthem with equivalent measures obtained for galaxies in denser environments. We\nfind a weak tendency for AMIGA spiral galaxies to be redder than objects in\nclose pairs. We find no clear difference when we compare with galaxies in other\n(e.g. group) environments. However, the (g-r) color of isolated galaxies shows\na Gaussian distribution as might be expected assuming nurture-free evolution.\nWe find a smaller median absolute deviation in colors for isolated galaxies\ncompared to both wide and close pairs. The majority of the deviation on median\ncolors for spiral subtypes is caused by a color-luminosity correlation.\nSurprisingly isolated and non-isolated early-type galaxies show similar (g-r).\nWe see little evidence for a green valley in our sample with most spirals\nredder than (g-r)=0.7 having spurious colors. The redder colors of AMIGA\nspirals and lower color dispersions for AMIGA subtypes -compared with close\npairs- is likely due to a more passive star formation in very isolated\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 17:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Unlike traditional fixed-rate codes, in rateless codes\neach codeword is infinitely long, and the decoding time depends on the\nconfidence level of the decoder. Using rateless codes along with sequential\ndecoding, and allowing a fixed probability of error at the decoder, we obtain\nresults for several communication scenarios. The results shown here are\nnon-asymptotic, in the sense that the size of the message set is finite. First\nwe consider the transmission of equiprobable messages using rateless codes over\na DMC, where the decoder knows the channel law. We obtain an achievable rate\nfor a fixed error probability and a finite message set. We show that as the\nmessage set size grows, the achievable rate approaches the optimum rate for\nthis setting. We then consider the universal case, in which the channel law is\nunknown to the decoder. We introduce a novel decoder that uses a mixture\nprobability assignment instead of the unknown channel law, and obtain an\nachievable rate for this case. Finally, we extend the scope for more advanced\nsettings. We use different flavors of the rateless coding scheme for joint\nsource-channel coding, coding with side-information and a combination of the\ntwo with universal coding, which yields a communication scheme that does not\nrequire any information on the source, the channel, or the amount the side\ninformation at the receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 17:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-30"}

These Lagrangian densities are based on the\nstatistical analysis of the behavior of field on a sample of points taken\nthroughout some \"small\" region of spacetime. However, in order for that sample\nto be statistically reliable, a lower bound on the size of that region needs to\nbe imposed. This results in \"unwanted contributions\" from higher order\nderivatives to the Lagrangian density, as well as non-trivial curvature effects\non the latter. It turns out that both gravitational and non-gravitational\neffects end up being highly non-linear. In the previous papers we were focused\non leading order terms, which allowed us to neglect these nonlinearities. We\nwould now like to go to the next order and investigate them. In the current\npaper we will exclusively focus on the effects of higher order derivatives in\nthe flat-space toy model. The gravitational effects will be studied in another\npaper which is currently in preparation. Both papers are restricted to bosonic\nfields, although the issue probably generalizes to fermions once Grassmann\nnumbers are dealt with in appropriate manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 18:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-30"}

When an electric current flows perpendicular to a\nmagnetic field, a Hall voltage develops in the direction transverse to both the\ncurrent and the field. In semiconductors, this behaviour is routinely used to\nmeasure the density and charge of the current carriers (electrons in conduction\nbands or holes in valence bands) -- internal properties of the system that are\nnot accessible from measurements of the conventional resistance. For strongly\ninteracting electron systems, whose behaviour can be very different from the\nfree electron gas, the Hall effect's sensitivity to internal properties makes\nit a powerful tool; indeed, the quantum Hall effects are named after the tool\nby which they are most distinctly measured instead of the physics from which\nthe phenomena originate.

First of all, we test the\neffect of acceleration location on the emission in several XRT filters by\nsimulating a series of post flare loops with different injection points for the\nnon-thermal particle beams. We use an injection distribution peaked at the loop\napex to represent a direct acceleration model, and an injection distribution\npeaked at the footpoints to represent the Alf\\'en wave interaction model. We\nfind that footpoint injection leads to several early peaks in the\napex-tofootpoint emission ratio. Second, we model a loop with cusp-shaped\ngeometry based on the eruptionmodel developed by Lin & Forbes (2000) and\nReeves& Forbes (2005a), and find that early in the flare, emission in the loop\nfootpoints is much brighter in the XRT filters if non-thermal particles are\nincluded in the calculation. Finally, we employ a multi-loop flare model to\nsimulate thermal emission and compare with a previous model where a\nsemi-circular geometry was used (Reeves et al. 2007).

In this framework the STSA originates\nfrom the q->q G splitting in the projectile (proton) light-cone wave function\nfollowed by a perturbative (C-odd) odderon interaction, together with a C-even\ninteraction, between the projectile and the target. We show that some aspects\nof the obtained expression for the STSA of the produced quarks are in\nqualitative agreement with experiment: STSA decreases with decreasing\nprojectile x_F and is a non-monotonic function of the transverse momentum k_T.\nIn our framework the STSA peaks at k_T near the saturation scale Q_s. Our\nmechanism predicts that the quark STSA in proton-nucleus collisions should be\nmuch smaller than in proton-proton collisions. We also observe that in our\nformalism the STSA for prompt photons is zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 20:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 23:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 21:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 20:25:58 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 15:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Specifically, we focus\non the formation of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo taken from the Aquarius\nproject and re-simulate it for a couple of representative cases in the allowed\nparameter space of this new model. We find that for these cases, the main halo\nonly develops a small core (~1 kpc) followed by a density profile identical to\nthat of the standard cold dark matter scenario outside of that radius. Neither\nthe subhalo mass function nor the radial number density of subhaloes are\naltered in these models but there is a significant change in the inner density\nstructure of subhaloes resulting in the formation of a large density core. As a\nconsequence, the inner circular velocity profiles of the most massive subhaloes\ndiffer significantly from the cold dark matter predictions and we demonstrate\nthat they are compatible with the observational data of the brightest Milky Way\ndSphs in such a velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter scenario.\nSpecifically, and contrary to the cold dark matter case, there are no subhaloes\nthat are more concentrated than what is inferred from the kinematics of the\nMilky Way dSphs.

In this work, we apply an analytic model that predicts the\nstructural properties of remnants formed in major mergers to progenitor disk\ngalaxies with properties taken from two different semi-analytic models. We\npredict the effective radius, velocity dispersion, luminosity, age, and\nmetallicity of the merger remnants, enabling us to compare directly to\nobservations of early-type galaxies. While we find a tight correlation between\nage and velocity dispersion, we find a stronger dependence of age and\nmetallicity on effective radius than observations report. The correlations\narise as a result of the dependence of gas fraction, age, and metallicity on\nthe stellar mass in the progenitor disk galaxies. These dependences induce a\nrotation in the radius-velocity plane between the correlations with effective\nradius and circular velocity in the disk galaxy progenitors, and the\ncorrelations with effective radius and velocity dispersion in the elliptical\ngalaxy remnants. The differences between our results and those from\nobservations suggest that major mergers alone cannot produce the observed lack\nof correlation between effective radius and stellar population parameters.\nSimulations have suggested that subsequent minor mergers introduce scatter in\nthe effective radius while leaving the velocity dispersion essentially\nunchanged. Incorporating such minor mergers into the model may, then, bring the\nsimulations into closer agreement with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 00:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

They are\nonly visible for temperatures below the transition temperature to a broken\nsymmetry phase which was discovered earlier and their intensity increases as\ntemperature is further decreased. The broken symmetry phase itself has\nsymmetries consistent with ordering of orbital current loops within a unit-cell\nwithout breaking translational symmetry. In order to calculate the collective\nmodes of such a state we add quantum terms to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) model with\nwhich the classical loop current order has been described. We derive that the\nmean field ground state of the quantum model is a product over all unit-cells\nof linear combination of the four possible classical configurations of the loop\ncurrent order in each unit-cell. The collective modes are calculated by using a\ngeneralized Holstein-Primakoff boson representation of orbital moment operators\nand lead to three branches of gapped weakly dispersive collective modes. The\nexperimental results are consistent with the two lower energy branches; the\nthird mode is at a higher energy than looked for by present neutron scattering\nexperiments and might also be over-damped. Implications of the discovery of the\ncollective modes are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 06:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Using a\nMCMC analysis, we compare the power of the CMB with that of the combination of\nCMB and galaxy survey data, to constrain the power spectrum of primordial\nfluctuations generated during inflation. We base our analysis on the Planck\nsatellite and a spectroscopic redshift survey with configuration parameters\nclose to those of the Euclid mission as examples. We first consider models of\nslow-roll inflation, and show that the inclusion of large scale structure data\nimproves the constraints by nearly halving the error bars on the scalar\nspectral index and its running. If we attempt to reconstruct the inflationary\nsingle-field potential, a similar conclusion can be reached on the parameters\ncharacterizing the potential. We then study models with features in the power\nspectrum. In particular, we consider ringing features produced by a break in\nthe potential and oscillations such as in axion monodromy. Adding large scale\nstructures improves the constraints on features by more than a factor of two.\nIn axion monodromy we show that there are oscillations with small amplitude and\nfrequency in momentum space that are undetected by CMB alone but can be\nmeasured by including galaxy surveys in the analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 12:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 11:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

As in the Non-Local Means filter, the proposed algorithm is\nbased on a weighted linear combination of the bserved image. But in contract to\nthe latter where the weights are defined by a Gaussian kernel, we propose to\nchoose them in an optimal way. First some \"oracle\" weights are defined by\nminimizing a very tight upper bound of the Mean Square Error. For a practical\napplication the weights are estimated from the observed image. We prove that\nthe proposed filter converges at the usual optimal rate to the true image.\nSimulation results are presented to compare the performance of the presented\nfilter with conventional filtering methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 15:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

We also\nemphasize that our lower bound is saturated for all $2\\otimes n$ states. Using\nthis we show that both the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and $W$\nstates of $N$ qubits satisfy monogamy of geometric discord. Indeed, the same\nholds for all $N$-qubit pure states which are equivalent to $W$ states under\nstochastic local operations and classical communication. We show by giving an\nexample that not all pure states of four or higher qubits satisfy monogamy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 15:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 19:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

Replacement $m=im$ results in the thermodynamical functions\nand the sound speed of an ordinary Fermi gas. When the Fermi momentum\napproaches the Dirac sea level k_F=m, the group velocity of most tachyons above\nthe sea is unbound, while the sound speed tends to infinity. This scenario is\nnot encountered in practice because the cold tachyon Fermi gas becomes unstable\nwith respect to hydrodynamical perturbations when k_F<\\sqrt{3/2}m.
