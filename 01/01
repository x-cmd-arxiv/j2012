A coalition\nis a set of peers that explicitly cooperate with other peers inside the\ncoalition via choking, data replication, and capacity allocation strategies.\nFurther, each peer interacts with other peers outside its coalition via\npotentially distinct choking, data replication, and capacity allocation\nstrategies. Following on our preliminary work in IEEE ICNP 2011 that\ndemonstrated significant performance benefits of coalitions, we present here a\ncomprehensive analysis of the choking and data replication strategies for\ncoalitions.\n  We first develop an analytical model to understand a simple random choking\nstrategy as a within-coalition strategy and show that it accurately predicts a\ncoalition's performance. Our analysis formally shows that the random choking\nstrategy can help a coalition achieve near-optimal performance by optimally\nchoosing the re-choking interval lengths and the number unchoke slots. Further,\nour analytical model can be easily adapted to model a BitTorrent-like swarm. We\nalso introduce a simple data replication strategy which significantly improves\ndata availability within a coalition as compared to the rarest-first piece\nreplication strategy employed in BitTorrent systems. We further propose a\ncooperation-aware better response strategy that achieves convergence of the\ndynamic coalition formation process when peers freely join or leave any\ncoalition.

The purpose of these statistics is to provide\nan estimate of each player's contribution to his team, independent of the\nstrength of his teammates, the strength of his opponents, and other variables\nthat are out of his control. One of the main downsides of the ordinary least\nsquares regression models is that the estimates have large error bounds. Since\ncertain pairs of teammates play together frequently, collinearity is present in\nthe data and is one reason for the large errors. In hockey, the relative lack\nof scoring compared to basketball is another reason. To deal with these issues,\nwe use ridge regression, a method that is commonly used in lieu of ordinary\nleast squares regression when collinearity is present in the data. We also\ncreate models that use not only goals, but also shots, Fenwick rating (shots\nplus missed shots), and Corsi rating (shots, missed shots, and blocked shots).\nOne benefit of using these statistics is that there are roughly ten times as\nmany shots as goals, so there is much more data when using these statistics and\nthe resulting estimates have smaller error bounds. The results of our ridge\nregression models are estimates of the offensive and defensive contributions of\nforwards and defensemen during even strength, power play, and short handed\nsituations, in terms of goals per 60 minutes.

We resolve this non-strict concavity\nproblem by using the idea of the proximal point method, which adds quadratic\nterms to make the objective function strictly concave. However, the proximal\nsolution adds an extra layer of iterations over typical duality based\napproaches, which can significantly slow down the speed of convergence. To\naddress this key weakness, we devise a fast algorithm without the need for this\nadditional layer of iterations, which converges to the optimal solution.

With these transitions, we suppress the diffuse\nlow density emission in the nuclear region. We detect and resolve the\nindividual compact giant molecular cloud associations (GMAs) in the 1.4 kpc\ncircumnuclear starburst ring and within the 350 pc nuclear region. The nucleus\nis brighter than the ring in both lines, and contributes to ~20% and ~30% to\nthe total detected HCO+(J = 3-2) and HCN(J = 3-2) flux, within the central 1.4\nkpc. The intensity ratios of HCN(J = 3-2)/HCO+(J = 3-2) are roughly unity in\nthe GMAs of the starburst ring. However, this ratio is up to ~2 in the nuclear\nregion. From the HCN(J = 3-2)/HCN(J = 1-0) ratio of <0.2 in the nucleus, we\ninfer that the nuclear HCN(J = 3-2) emission might be optically thin. The\nHCO+(J = 3-2) and HCN(J = 3-2) show correlations with 12CO(J = 3-2) and the\n24{\\mu}m emission. The tight correlations of HCN(J = 3-2), HCO+(J = 3-2) and\n24{\\mu}m emission in the starburst ring suggest that the dense molecular gas\nand the dust are from the same origins of star forming regions. On the other\nhand, the HCN(J = 3-2) emission of the nucleus is significantly enhanced,\nindicating mechanisms other than star formation, such as AGN activities. A\nself-consistent check of the fractional abundance enhanced by X-ray ionization\nchemistry of the nucleus is possible with our observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2012 07:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The cuprate parent compound has one unpaired electron per Cu\nsite, and is predicted by band theory to be a half-filled metal. The strong\nonsite Coulomb repulsion, however, prohibits electron hopping between\nneighboring sites and leads to a Mott insulator ground state with\nantiferromagnetic (AF) ordering. Charge carriers doped into the CuO2 plane\ndestroy the insulating phase and superconductivity emerges as the carrier\ndensity is sufficiently high. The natural starting point for tackling high Tc\nsuperconductivity is to elucidate the electronic structure of the parent Mott\ninsulator and the behavior of a single doped charge. Here we use a scanning\ntunneling microscope to investigate the atomic scale electronic structure of\nthe Ca2CuO2Cl2 parent Mott insulator of the cuprates. The full electronic\nspectrum across the Mott-Hubbard gap is uncovered for the first time, which\nreveals the particle-hole symmetric and spatially uniform Hubbard bands.

ASP.NET web applications typically employ server\ncontrols to provide dynamic web pages, and data-bound server controls to\ndisplay and maintain database data. Though the default properties allow for\nfast creation of workable applications, creating a high-performance,\nmulti-user, and scalable web application requires careful configuring of server\ncontrols and their enhancement using custom-made code. In providing commonly\nrequired functionality in data-driven ASP.NET web applications such as paging,\nsorting and filtering, our empirical study evaluated the impact of various\ntechnical approaches: automatic data binding in web server controls; data\npaging and sorting on web server; paging and sorting on database server;\nindexed and non-indexed database columns; clustered vs. non-clustered indices.\nThe study observed significant performance differences between various\ntechnical approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2012 15:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

It is found that training and recovery of exchange field are\nproportional to the logarithm of the training cycles and recovery time,\nrespectively. These behaviours are explained within the model based on thermal\nactivation. For the field sweep rates of 1000, 2000 and 4000 Oe/s, the\nrelaxation time of antiferromagnet spins are 61.4, 27.6, and 11.5 in the unit\nof $ms$ respectively, much shorter than the long relaxation time (~10^2 s) in\nconventional magnetometry measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2012 15:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Another unsolved\nquestion concerns the treatment of subluminal components of a tachyonic wave\npackets in the field-theoretical formalism, and the calculation of the\ntime-ordered propagator. After a brief discussion on related problems, we\nconclude that rather painful choices have to be made in order to incorporate\ntachyonic spin-1/2 particles into field theory. We argue that the field theory\nneeds to be formulated such as to allow for localizable tachyonic particles,\neven if that means that a slight unitarity violation is introduced into the S\nmatrix, and we write down field operators with unrestricted momenta. We find\nthat once these choices have been made, the propagator for the neutrino field\ncan be given in a compact form, and the left-handedness of the neutrino as well\nas the right-handedness of the antineutrino follow naturally. Consequences for\nneutrinoless double beta decay and superluminal propagation of neutrinos are\nbriefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2012 15:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-29"}
