Our approach, therefore, has to learn character\nrepresentations without supervision and requires a mechanism to distinguish\nlearned representations from irregular patterns. To learn character\nrepresentations, we use a probabilistic generative model parameterizing pattern\nfeatures, feature variances, the features' planar arrangements, and pattern\nfrequencies. The latent variables of the model describe pattern class, pattern\nposition, and the presence or absence of individual pattern features. The model\nparameters are optimized using a novel variational EM approximation. After\nlearning, the parameters represent, independently of their absolute position,\nplanar feature arrangements and their variances. A quality measure defined\nbased on the learned representation then allows for an autonomous\ndiscrimination between regular character patterns and the irregular patterns\nmaking up the dirt. The irregular patterns can thus be removed to clean the\ndocument. For a full Latin alphabet we found that a single page does not\ncontain sufficiently many character examples. However, even if heavily\ncorrupted by dirt, we show that a page containing a lower number of character\ntypes can efficiently and autonomously be cleaned solely based on the\nstructural regularity of the characters it contains. In different examples\nusing characters from different alphabets, we demonstrate generality of the\napproach and discuss its implications for future developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 16:09:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 12:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

This is applied to study the impact the choice of prior\ndensity has in two market scenarios. In the first scenario, call option prices\nare prescribed at only a small number of strikes, and we see that the choice of\nprior, or indeed its omission, yields notably different densities. The second\nscenario is given by CBOE option price data for S&P500 index options at a large\nnumber of strikes. Prior information is now considered to be given by\ncalibrated Heston, Schoebel-Zhu or Variance Gamma models. We find that the\nresulting digital option prices are essentially the same as those given by the\n(non-relative) Buchen-Kelly density itself. In other words, in a sufficiently\nliquid market the influence of the prior density seems to vanish almost\ncompletely.

At the basis of a method lays\nthe idea of representation of a boundary condition on distribution function in\nthe form of a source in the kinetic equation. By means of integrals Fourier the\nkinetic equation with a source is reduced to the integral equation of Fredholm\ntype of the second kind.

These\neclipses offer a unique opportunity to probe directly the magnetospheric\nstructure and the plasma properties of pulsar B. We have performed a\ncomprehensive analysis of the eclipse phenomenology using multi-frequency radio\nobservations obtained with the Green Bank Telescope. We have characterized the\nperiodic flux modulations previously discovered at 820 MHz by McLaughlin et\nal., and investigated the radio frequency dependence of the duration and depth\nof the eclipses. Based on their weak radio frequency evolution, we conclude\nthat the plasma in pulsar B's magnetosphere requires a large multiplicity\nfactor (~ 10^5). We also found that, as expected, flux modulations are present\nat all radio frequencies in which eclipses can be detected. Their complex\nbehavior is consistent with the confinement of the absorbing plasma in the\ndipolar magnetic field of pulsar B as suggested by Lyutikov & Thompson and such\na geometric connection explains that the observed periodicity is harmonically\nrelated to pulsar B's spin frequency. We observe that the eclipses require a\nsharp transition region beyond which the plasma density drops off abruptly.\nSuch a region defines a plasmasphere which would be well inside the\nmagnetospheric boundary of an undisturbed pulsar. It is also two times smaller\nthan the expected standoff radius calculated using the balance of the wind\npressure from pulsar A and the nominally estimated magnetic pressure of pulsar\nB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 18:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Owing to the Riemannian structure thus introduced in\nthe space, the result of quantization is considered as quantum mecanics (QM) of\na particle. Contradiction of QP to the Principles of General Covariance and\nEquivalence is discussed. It is found that actually the historically first\nHilbert space based quantization by E. Schr\\\"odinger (1926), after revision in\nthe modern framework of QM, also leads to QP in the form that B. DeWitt had\nbeen found 26 years later. Efforts to avoid QP or reduce its drawbacks are\ndiscussed. The general conclusion is that some form of QP and a violation of\nthe principles of general relativity induced by it are apparently inevitable in\nthe non-relativistic QM. It is shown also that Feynman quantization singles out\ntwo versions of QP, which both determine two bi-scalar propagators which fix\ntwo different algorithms of path integral calculation.

The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations.

Gravitational lensing is one of the leading tools in understanding\nthe dark side of the Universe. The need for accurate, efficient and effective\nmethods which are able to extract this information along with other\ncosmological parameters from cosmic shear data is ever growing. COSEBIs,\nComplete Orthogonal Sets of E-/B-Integrals, is a recently developed statistical\nmeasure that encompasses the complete E-/B-mode separable information contained\nin the shear correlation functions measured on a finite angular range. Aims.\nThe aim of the present work is to test the properties of this newly developed\nstatistics for a higher-dimensional parameter space and to generalize and test\nit for shear tomography. Methods. We use Fisher analysis to study the\neffectiveness of COSEBIs. We show our results in terms of figure-of-merit\nquantities, based on Fisher matrices. Results. We find that a relatively small\nnumber of COSEBIs modes is always enough to saturate to the maximum information\nlevel. This number is always smaller for 'logarithmic COSEBIs' than for 'linear\nCOSEBIs', and also depends on the number of redshift bins, the number and\nchoice of cosmological parameters, as well as the survey characteristics.\nConclusions. COSEBIs provide a very compact way of analyzing cosmic shear data,\ni.e., all the E-/B-mode separable second-order statistical information in the\ndata is reduced to a small number of COSEBIs modes. Furthermore, with this\nmethod the arbitrariness in data binning is no longer an issue since the\nCOSEBIs modes are discrete. Finally, the small number of modes also implies\nthat covariances, and their inverse, are much more conveniently obtainable,\ne.g., from numerical simulations, than for the shear correlation functions\nthemselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 20:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The goal is to achieve a distribution where\nall nodes have nearly the same number of tokens.\n  For the continuous case where tokens are arbitrarily divisible, most load\nbalancing schemes correspond to Markov chains, whose convergence is fairly\nwell-understood in terms of their spectral gap. However, in many applications,\nload items cannot be divided arbitrarily, and we need to deal with the discrete\ncase where the load is composed of indivisible tokens. This discretization\nentails a non-linear behavior due to its rounding errors, which makes this\nanalysis much harder than in the continuous case.\n  We investigate several randomized protocols for different communication\nmodels in the discrete case. As our main result, we prove that for any regular\nnetwork in the matching model, all nodes have the same load up to an additive\nconstant in (asymptotically) the same number of rounds as required in the\ncontinuous case. This generalizes and tightens the previous best result, which\nonly holds for expander graphs, and demonstrates that there is almost no\ndifference between the discrete and continuous cases.

We review extensive studies of multilayered copper oxides\nby site-selective nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which have uncovered the\nintrinsic phase diagram of antiferromagnetism (AFM) and HTSC for a\ndisorder-free CuO2 plane with hole carriers. We present our experimental\nfindings such as the existence of the AFM metallic state in doped Mott\ninsulators, the uniformly mixed phase of AFM and HTSC, and the emergence of\nd-wave SC with a maximum Tc just outside a critical carrier density, at which\nthe AFM moment on a CuO2 plane disappears. These results can be accounted for\nby the Mott physics based on the t-J model. The superexchange interaction J_in\namong spins plays a vital role as a glue for Cooper pairs or mobile\nspin-singlet pairs, in contrast to the phonon-mediated attractive interaction\namong electrons established in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. We\nremark that the attractive interaction for raising the $T_c$ of HTSC up to\ntemperatures as high as 160 K is the large J_in (~0.12 eV), which binds\nelectrons of opposite spins to be on neighboring sites, and that there are no\nbosonic glues. It is the Coulomb repulsive interaction U(> 6 eV) among Cu-3d\nelectrons that plays a central role in the physics behind high-Tc phenomena.

We use\nORION, an adaptive mesh refinement gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics code, to\nsimulate the formation of a cluster of low-mass stars, including both radiative\ntransfer and protostellar outflows. We ran four simulations to isolate the\nindividual effects of radiation feedback and outflow feedback as well as the\ncombination of the two. Outflows reduce protostellar masses and accretion rates\neach by a factor of three and therefore reduce protostellar luminosities by an\norder of magnitude. Thus, while radiation feedback suppresses fragmentation,\noutflows render protostellar radiation largely irrelevant for low-mass star\nformation above a mass scale of 0.05 M_sun. We find initial fragmentation of\nour cloud at half the global Jeans length, ~ 0.1 pc. With insufficient\nprotostellar radiation to stop it, these 0.1 pc cores fragment repeatedly,\nforming typically 10 stars each. The accretion rate in these stars scales with\nmass as predicted from core accretion models that include both thermal and\nturbulent motions. We find that protostellar outflows do not significantly\naffect the overall cloud dynamics, in the absence of magnetic fields, due to\ntheir small opening angles and poor coupling to the dense gas. The outflows\nreduce the mass from the cores by 2/3, giving a core to star efficiency ~ 1/3.\nThe simulation with radiation and outflows reproduces the observed protostellar\nluminosity function.

Two global network properties are considered: the size\nof the largest connected component in the network (the giant), and secondly,\nthe possible size of an epidemic outbreak taking place on the network, in which\ntransmission occurs only between network neighbours, and with probability $p$.\nThe main conclusion is that in most cases, egocentric data allow for a large\nrange of possible sizes of the giant and the outbreak. However, there is an\nupper bound for the latter. For the case that the network is selected uniformly\namong networks with prescribed egocentric data (satisfying some conditions),\nthe asymptotic size of the giant and the outbreak is characterised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 10:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-16"}

The cluster consensus is defined by two aspects:\nthe intra-cluster synchronization, that the state differences between each pair\nof agents in the same cluster converge to zero, and inter-cluster separation,\nthat the states of the agents in different clusters are separated. For\nintra-cluster synchronization, the concepts and theories of consensus including\nthe spanning trees, scramblingness, infinite stochastic matrix product and\nHajnal inequality, are extended. With them, it is proved that if the graph has\ncluster spanning trees and all vertices self-linked, then static linear system\ncan realize intra-cluster synchronization.

The regime of large deviations is separated\nfrom the regime of typical fluctuations by a phase transition where the\nsymmetry between the points in the sample is spontaneously broken. For\nstochastic processes with a fat tailed microscopic noise, this implies that\nwhile typical realizations are well described by a diffusion process with\ncontinuous sample paths, large deviation paths are typically discontinuous. For\neigenvalues of random matrices with fat tailed distributed elements, a large\ndeviation where the trace of the matrix is anomalously large concentrates on\njust a single eigenvalue, whereas in the thin tailed world the large deviation\naffects the whole distribution. These results find a natural application to\nfinance. Since the price dynamics of financial stocks is characterized by fat\ntailed increments, large fluctuations of stock prices are expected to be\nrealized by discrete jumps. Interestingly, we find that large excursions of\nprices are more likely realized by continuous drifts rather than by\ndiscontinuous jumps. Indeed, auto-correlations suppress the concentration of\nlarge deviations. Financial covariance matrices also exhibit an anomalously\nlarge eigenvalue, the market mode, as compared to the prediction of random\nmatrix theory.

It is found that the long memory in the order directions (Hurst\nindex $H_s$) has a negligible effect on the interval distributions and the\nmultifractal nature. In contrast, the power-law exponent of the interval\ndistribution increases linearly with respect to the Hurst index $H_x$ of the\nrelative prices, and the singularity width of the multifractal nature\nfluctuates around a constant value when $H_x<0.7$ and then increases with\n$H_x$. No evident effects of $H_s$ and $H_x$ are found on the long memory of\nthe recurrence intervals. Our results indicate that the nontrivial properties\nof the recurrence intervals of returns are mainly caused by traders' behaviors\nof persistently placing new orders around the best bid and ask prices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 18:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-10"}

In\nthis work we consider solving recursive game graphs (or pushdown game graphs)\nthat can model the control flow of sequential programs with recursion. While\npushdown games have been studied before with qualitative objectives, such as\nreachability and $\\omega$-regular objectives, in this work we study for the\nfirst time such games with the most well-studied quantitative objective,\nnamely, mean-payoff objectives. In pushdown games two types of strategies are\nrelevant: (1) global strategies, that depend on the entire global history; and\n(2) modular strategies, that have only local memory and thus does not depend on\nthe context of invocation, but only on the history of the current invocation of\nthe module. Our main results are as follows (1) One-player pushdown games with\nmean-payoff objectives under global strategies is decidable in polynomial time.\n(2) Two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under global\nstrategies is undecidable. (3) One-player pushdown games with mean-payoff\nobjectives under modular strategies is NP-hard. (4) Two-player pushdown games\nwith mean-payoff objectives under modular strategies can be solved in NP (i.e.,\nboth one-player and two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under\nmodular strategies is NP-complete). We also establish the optimal strategy\ncomplexity showing that global strategies for mean-payoff objectives require\ninfinite memory even in one-player pushdown games; and memoryless modular\nstrategies are sufficient in two-player pushdown games. Finally we also show\nthat all the problems have the same complexity if the stack boundedness\ncondition is added, where along with the mean-payoff objective the player must\nalso ensure that the stack height is bounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 13:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 11:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 May 2016 11:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-17"}

At every round of a game, each\nplayer simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly\ndetermine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the\nsafety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, the\nreachability objective to reach a given set of states. First, we present a\nsimple proof of the fact that in concurrent reachability games, for all\n$\\epsilon>0$, memoryless $\\epsilon$-optimal strategies exist. A memoryless\nstrategy is independent of the history of plays, and an $\\epsilon$-optimal\nstrategy achieves the objective with probability within $\\epsilon$ of the value\nof the game. In contrast to previous proofs of this fact, our proof is more\nelementary and more combinatorial. Second, we present a strategy-improvement\n(a.k.a.\\ policy-iteration) algorithm for concurrent games with reachability\nobjectives. We then present a strategy-improvement algorithm for concurrent\ngames with safety objectives. Our algorithms yield sequences of player-1\nstrategies which ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to\nthe value of the game. Our result is significant because the\nstrategy-improvement algorithm for safety games provides, for the first time, a\nway to approximate the value of a concurrent safety game from below.

However,\nquantitative neuroanatomical studies of the dimensions of axonal and dendritic\ntrees of neurons in the neocortex show that this co-localization assumption is\nnot valid. In this paper we describe a simple modification to the WTA circuit\ndesign that permits the effects of distributed inhibitory neurons to be coupled\nthrough synchronization, and so allows a single WTA to be distributed widely in\ncortical space, well beyond the arborization of any single inhibitory neuron,\nand even across different cortical areas. We prove by non-linear contraction\nanalysis, and demonstrate by simulation that distributed WTA sub-systems\ncombined by such inhibitory synchrony are inherently stable. We show\nanalytically that synchronization is substantially faster than winner\nselection. This circuit mechanism allows networks of independent WTAs to fully\nor partially compete with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 14:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 10:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

The\nbinary exerts a gravitational torque on the circumbinary disk and thereby the\norbital angular momentum is transferred to it, while the angular momentum of\nthe circumbinary disk is transferred to the binary through the mass accretion.\nThe binary undergoes an orbital decay due to both the gravitational wave\nemission and the binary-disk interaction. This causes the phase evolution of\nthe gravitational wave signal. The precise measurement of the gravitational\nwave phase thus may provide information regarding the circumbinary disk. In\nthis paper, we assess the detectability of the signature of the binary-disk\ninteraction using the future space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as\nDECIGO and BBO by the standard matched filtering analysis.

By exploiting the\nphase-space method and combining it with the application of a topological\nargument, it is shown that the instability of a gap soliton can be described by\nthe phase portrait of the solution.

The\nequations are Hamiltonian, and can be reduced to a dynamical system for 5 real\nvariables with 2 conservation laws. If the Hamiltonian, $H$, is zero we reduce\nthis dynamical system to the motion of a particle in a one-dimensional\ntime-independent potential and prove that the system is integrable. Explicit\nsolutions are obtained for some particular initial conditions. When explicit\nsolution is not possible we present a novel numerical/analytical method for\napproximating the dynamics. Furthermore we show analytically that when H=0 the\nmotion is generically bounded. That is to say the waves in the forced triad are\nbounded in amplitude for all times for any initial condition with the single\nexception of one special choice of initial condition for which the forcing is\nin phase with the nonlinear oscillation of the triad. This means that the\nenergy in the forced triad generically remains finite for all time despite the\nfact that there is no dissipation in the system. We provide a detailed\ncharacterisation of the dependence of the period and maximum energy of the\nsystem on the conserved quantities and forcing intensity. When $H \\neq 0$ we\nreduce the problem to the motion of a particle in a one-dimensional\ntime-periodic potential.

By introducing a new secrecy capacity upper bound, we prove that the\nsecrecy capacity is achieved by Gaussian input without prefixing.

The radio galaxy IC310 in the Perseus cluster has recently been\ndetected in the gamma-ray regime at GeV and TeV energies.

High-resolution studies of the radio morphology help to constrain the\ngeometry of the jet on sub-pc scales and to find out where the high-energy\nemission might come from.\n  Methods. We analyzed May 2011 VLBA data of IC310 at a wavelength of 3.6 cm,\nrevealing the parsec-scale radio structure of this source. We compared our\nfindings with more information available from contemporary single-dish flux\ndensity measurements with the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope.\n  Results. We have detected a one-sided core-jet structure with blazar-like,\nbeamed radio emission oriented along the same position angle as the kiloparsec\nscale radio structure observed in the past by connected interferometers.\nDoppler-boosting favoritism is consistent with an angle of theta < 38 degrees\nbetween the jet axis and the line-of-sight, i.e., very likely within the\nboundary dividing low-luminosity radio galaxies and BL Lac objects in unified\nschemes.\n  Conclusions. The stability of the jet orientation from parsec to kiloparsec\nscales in IC310 argues against its classification as a headtail radio galaxy;\ni.e., there is no indication of an interaction with the intracluster medium\nthat would determine the direction of the tail. IC310 seems to represent a\nlow-luminosity FRI radio galaxy at a borderline angle to reveal its BL Lac-type\ncentral engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 15:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It is shown that the derived equations have\nmass-like and mass parameters for waves and point particles, respectively, and\nthat the physical meaning of these parameters sheds a new light on the\nfundamental problem of the nature of inertial mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 14:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-19"}
