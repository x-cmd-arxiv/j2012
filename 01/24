At the two-point level\nthis problem was resolved by developing the so-called ring statistics, and\nlater the COSEBIs; however, extending these concepts to the three-point level\nis far from trivial. Currently used methods to decompose three-point shear\ncorrelation functions (3PCFs) into E- and B-modes require knowledge of the 3PCF\ndown to arbitrary small scales. This implies that the 3PCF needs to be modeled\non scales smaller than the minimum separation of 2 galaxies and subsequently\nwill be biased towards the model, or, in the absence of a model, the statistics\nis affected by E/B-mode leakage (or mixing). In this paper we derive a new\nthird-order E/B-mode statistic that performs the decomposition using the 3PCF\nonly on a finite interval, and thereby is free of any E/B-mode leakage while at\nthe same time relying solely on information from the data. In addition, we\nrelate this third-order ring statistics to the convergence field, thereby\nenabling a fast and convenient calculation of this statistic from numerical\nsimulations. We note that our new statistics should be applicable to\ncorresponding E/B-mode separation problems in the CMB polarization field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 16:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We generalize this result to the\nsetting in which the gambler and the prophet are allowed to make more than one\nselection, subject to a matroid constraint. We show that the gambler can still\nachieve at least half as much reward as the prophet; this result is the best\npossible, since it is known that the ratio cannot be improved even in the\noriginal prophet inequality, which corresponds to the special case of rank-one\nmatroids.

We are interested in this class of network coding due to its\nnumerous benefits, such as low decoding delay, low coding and decoding\ncomplexities and simple receiver requirements. We first extend the IDNC graph,\nwhich represents all feasible IDNC coding opportunities, to efficiently operate\nin both multicast and broadcast scenarios. We then formulate the minimum\ncompletion delay problem for IDNC as a stochastic shortest path (SSP) problem.\nAlthough finding the optimal policy using SSP is intractable, we use this\nformulation to draw the theoretical guidelines for the policies that can\nefficiently reduce the completion delay in IDNC.

We show that the restricted three-body\napproximation provides a simple and clear description of the dynamics. The\norbit of a binary with mass m around a massive object M should be almost\nparabolic with an eccentricity |1-e| < (m/M)^{1/3} << 1 for a member to be\ncaptured, while the other is ejected. Indeed, the energy change of the members\nobtained for a parabolic orbit can be used to describe non-parabolic cases. If\na binary has an encounter velocity much larger than (M/m)^{1/3} times the\nbinary rotation velocity, it would be abruptly disrupted, and the energy change\nat the encounter can be evaluated in a simple disruption model. We evaluate the\nprobability distributions for the ejection and capture of circular binary\nmembers and for the final energies. In principle, for any hyperbolic (elliptic)\norbit, the heavier member has more chance to be ejected (captured), because it\ncarries a larger fraction of the orbital energy. However, if the orbital energy\nis close to zero, the difference between the two members becomes small, and\nthere is practically no ejection and capture preference. The preference becomes\nsignificant when the orbital energy is comparable to the typical energy change\nat the encounter.

A coupled electron spin can be used to\npolarise the nuclear spin and create fast single-qubit gates, however, the\npermanent presence of electron spins is a source of nuclear decoherence. Here\nwe show how a transient electron spin, arising from the optically excited\ntriplet state of C60, can be used to hyperpolarise, manipulate and measure two\nnearby nuclear spins.

A variety\nof control methods and network topologies have been proposed, on the basis that\ntransfer with perfect fidelity --- i.e. deterministic and without information\nloss --- is impossible through unmodulated spin chains with more than a few\nparticles. Solving the original problem formulated by Bose [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n91, 207901 (2003)], we determine the exact number of qubits in unmodulated\nchains (with XY Hamiltonian) that permit the transfer with fidelity arbitrarily\nclose to 1, a phenomenon called pretty good state transfer. We prove that this\nhappens if and only if the number of nodes is n=p-1, 2p-1, where p is a prime,\nor n=2^{m}-1.

The\nso called local bias model, where galaxy density is a function of local matter\ndensity, is frequently discussed as a means to infer the matter power spectrum\nor correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation. However,\ngravitational evolution generates a term quadratic in the tidal tensor and thus\nnon-local in the density field, even if this term is absent in the initial\nconditions (Lagrangian space). Because the term is quadratic, it contributes as\na loop correction to the power spectrum, so the standard linear bias picture\nstill applies on large scales, however, it contributes at leading order to the\nbispectrum for which it is significant on all scales. Such a term could also be\npresent in Lagrangian space if halo formation were influenced by the tidal\nfield. We measure the corresponding coupling strengths from the\nmatter-matter-halo bispectrum in numerical simulations and find a non-vanishing\ncoefficient for the tidal tensor term. We find no scale dependence of the bias\nparameters up to k=0.1 h/Mpc and that the tidal effect is increasing with halo\nmass. While the Lagrangian bias picture is a better description of our results\nthan the Eulerian bias picture, our results suggest that there might be a tidal\ntensor bias already in the initial conditions. We also find that the\ncoefficients of the quadratic density term deviate quite strongly from the\ntheoretical predictions based on the spherical collapse model and a universal\nmass function. Both quadratic density and tidal tensor bias terms must be\nincluded in the modeling of galaxy clustering of current and future surveys if\none wants to achieve the high precision cosmology promise of these datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 19:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

One such reconnection scenario occurs at a 3D\nmagnetic null point, where global plasma flows give rise to strong currents in\nthe spine axis or fan plane. Aims: To understand the mechanism of charged\nparticle energy gain in both the external drift region and the diffusion region\nassociated with 3D magnetic reconnection. In doing so we evaluate the\nefficiency of resistive spine and fan models for particle acceleration, and\nfind possible observables for each. Method: We use a full orbit test particle\napproach to study proton trajectories within electromagnetic fields that are\nexact solutions to the steady and incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations.\nWe study single particle trajectories and find energy spectra from many\nparticle simulations. The scaling properties of the accelerated particles with\nrespect to field and plasma parameters is investigated. Results: For fan\nreconnection, strong non-uniform electric drift streamlines can accelerate the\nbulk of the test particles. The highest energy gain is for particles that enter\nthe current sheet, where an increasing \"guide field\" stabilises particles\nagainst ejection. The energy is only limited by the total electric potential\nenergy difference across the fan current sheet. The spine model has both slow\nexternal electric drift speed and weak energy gain for particles reaching the\ncurrent sheet. Conclusions: The electromagnetic fields of fan reconnection can\naccelerate protons to the high energies observed in solar flares, gaining up to\n0.1 GeV for anomalous values of resistivity. However, the spine model, which\ngave a harder energy spectrum in the ideal case, is not an efficient\naccelerator after pressure constraints in the resistive model are included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 20:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Several\nrecent papers have used methods from machine learning and statistics to\nconstruct classifiers on databases of labeled, multi--epoch sources with the\nintention of using these classifiers to automatically infer the classes of\nunlabeled sources from new surveys. However, the same source observed with two\ndifferent synoptic surveys will generally yield different derived metrics\n(features) from the light curve. Since such features are used in classifiers,\nthis survey-dependent mismatch in feature space will typically lead to degraded\nclassifier performance. In this paper we show how and why feature distributions\nchange using OGLE and \\textit{Hipparcos} light curves. To overcome survey\nsystematics, we apply a method, \\textit{noisification}, which attempts to\nempirically match distributions of features between the labeled sources used to\nconstruct the classifier and the unlabeled sources we wish to classify. Results\nfrom simulated and real--world light curves show that noisification can\nsignificantly improve classifier performance. In a three--class problem using\nlight curves from \\textit{Hipparcos} and OGLE, noisification reduces the\nclassifier error rate from 27.0% to 7.0%. We recommend that noisification be\nused for upcoming surveys such as Gaia and LSST and describe some of the\npromises and challenges of applying noisification to these surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 21:01:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 22:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In order to shed some light\non this issue, we evaluate the exact dynamics of some single qubit gate\nfidelities using the measurement-based quantum computation scheme when the\nqubits which are used as resource interact with a common dephasing environment.\nWe report a necessary condition for the fidelity dynamics of a general pure\nN-qubit state, interacting with this type of error channel, to present an\noscillatory behavior and we show that for the initial canonical cluster state\nthe fidelity oscillates as a function of time. This state fidelity oscillatory\nbehavior brings significant variations to the values of the computational\nresults of a generic gate acting on that state depending on the instants we\nchoose to apply our set of projective measurements. As we shall see,\nconsidering some specific gates that are frequently found in the literature,\nneither fast application of the set of projective measurements necessarily\nimplies high gate fidelity, nor slow application thereof necessarily implies\nlow gate fidelity. Our condition for the occurrence of the fidelity oscillatory\nbehavior shows that the oscillation presented by the cluster state is due\nexclusively to its initial geometry. Other states that can be used as resources\nfor measurement-based quantum computation can present the same initial\ngeometrical condition.

Video CS is complicated by the ephemeral nature of dynamic\nevents, which makes direct extensions of standard CS imaging architectures and\nsignal models difficult. In this paper, we develop a new framework for video CS\nfor dynamic textured scenes that models the evolution of the scene as a linear\ndynamical system (LDS). This reduces the video recovery problem to first\nestimating the model parameters of the LDS from compressive measurements, and\nthen reconstructing the image frames. We exploit the low-dimensional dynamic\nparameters (the state sequence) and high-dimensional static parameters (the\nobservation matrix) of the LDS to devise a novel compressive measurement\nstrategy that measures only the dynamic part of the scene at each instant and\naccumulates measurements over time to estimate the static parameters. This\nenables us to lower the compressive measurement rate considerably.

We\naddress this problem by introducing a framework that captures the notion of\ncommunities or clusters determined by the relative affinities among their\nmembers. To this end we define what we call an affinity system, which is a set\nof elements, each with a vector characterizing its preference for all other\nelements in the set. We define a natural notion of (potentially overlapping)\ncommunities in an affinity system, in which the members of a given community\ncollectively prefer each other to anyone else outside the community. Thus these\ncommunities are endogenously formed in the affinity system and are\n\"self-determined\" or \"self-certified\" by its members.\n  We provide a tight polynomial bound on the number of self-determined\ncommunities as a function of the robustness of the community. We present a\npolynomial-time algorithm for enumerating these communities. Moreover, we\nobtain a local algorithm with a strong stochastic performance guarantee that\ncan find a community in time nearly linear in the of size the community.\n  Social networks fit particularly naturally within the affinity system\nframework -- if we can appropriately extract the affinities from the relatively\nsparse yet rich information from social networks, our analysis then yields a\nset of efficient algorithms for enumerating self-determined communities in\nsocial networks.

The method consists in constructing mappings\nfrom triangles in a background mesh to curvilinear ones that conform exactly to\nthe immersed domain. Constructing such a map relies on a novel way of\nparameterizing the immersed boundary over a collection of nearby edges with its\nclosest point projection. By interpolating the mappings to curvilinear\ntriangles at select points, we recover isoparametric mappings for the immersed\ndomain defined over the background mesh. Indeed, interpolating the constructed\nmappings just at the vertices of the background mesh yields a fast meshing\nalgorithm that involves only perturbing a few vertices near the boundary.\n  For the discretization of a curved domain to be robust, we have to impose\nrestrictions on the background mesh. Conversely, these restrictions define a\nfamily of domains that can be discretized with a given background mesh. We then\nsay that the background mesh is a universal mesh for such a family of domains.\nThe notion of universal meshes is particularly useful in free/moving boundary\nproblems because the same background mesh can serve as the universal mesh for\nthe evolving domain for time intervals that are independent of the time step.\nHence it facilitates a framework for finite element calculations over evolving\ndomains while using a fixed background mesh. Furthermore, since the evolving\ngeometry can be approximated with any desired order, numerical solutions can be\ncomputed with high-order accuracy.

Our study helps\nconstrain the evolution of bars and disks in dense environments and provides a\ncomparison point for studies in lower density environments and at higher\nredshifts. (1) We characterize the fraction and properties of bars in a sample\nof 32 bright (M_V <= -18, M_* > 10^9.5 M_sun) S0 galaxies, which dominate the\npopulation of massive disk galaxies in the Coma core. Measuring the S0 bar\nfraction must be handled carefully, as the results depend on the method used:\nthe bar fraction for bright S0s in the Coma core is 50%+/-11%, 65%+/-11%, and\n60%+/-11% for three methods of bar detection: strict ellipse fit criteria,\nrelaxed ellipse fit criteria, and visual classification. (2) We compare the S0\nbar fraction across different environments (Coma core, A901/902, Virgo). We\nfind that the bar fraction among bright S0 galaxies does not show a\nstatistically significant variation across environments spanning two orders of\nmagnitude in galaxy number density (n~300-10,000 gal/Mpc^3). We speculate that\nthe S0 bar fraction is not significantly enhanced in rich clusters because S0s\nin rich clusters are less prone to bar instabilities as they are dynamically\nhot and gas poor due to ram pressure stripping and accelerated star formation.\nIn addition, high-speed encounters in rich clusters may be less effective than\nslow, strong encounters in inducing bars. (3) We analyze a sample of 333 faint\n(M_V > -18) dwarf galaxies in the Coma core. Using unsharp-masking, we find\nonly 13 galaxies with bar and/or spiral structure. The paucity of disk\nstructures in Coma dwarfs suggests that either disks are not common in these\ngalaxies, or that any disks present are too hot to develop instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 03:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The key idea is that the\nstate of the incoming atom be regarded as belonging to an irreducible unitary\nray representation of this group. If this is the case, interaction with an\ninterferometer with a which-way detector must split this state into the direct\nsum of two states belonging to representations with different internal\nenergies. (While the zero of internal energy is arbitrary, the difference\nbetween two internal energies is well-defined and is invariant under unitary\ntransformations.) The state of the outgoing atom will then be a superposition\nof two mutually orthogonal states, so that there will be no interference.\nNeither complementarity nor entanglement plays a role in this explanation.\nFurthermore, in atom interferometry it is not enough for a quantum eraser to\nerase the internal energy difference; to restore interference, two copies of a\nrepresentation have to be collapsed into one. In a direct sum of copies of the\nsame representation, copies of the same state will still be orthogonal. These\nassertions may be testable, and two new atom interferometry experiments are\nsuggested. One of them is an `own-goal' experiment which may decisively refute\nthe explanation offered here, and restore the aura of mystery that this paper\ntries to dispel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 10:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-25"}

When plotting M_BH versus M_NC\nwe find three different regimes: (a) nuclear cluster dominated nuclei, (b) a\ntransition region, and (c) black hole-dominated nuclei. This is consistent with\nthe picture, in which black holes form inside nuclear clusters with a very\nlow-mass fraction. They subsequently grow much faster than the nuclear cluster,\ndestroying it when the ratio M_BH/M_NC grows above 100. Nuclear star clusters\nmay thus be the precursors of massive black holes in galaxy nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 11:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 08:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We performed both a\nperiod analysis of the times of the minima and a BVR light curve analysis. Many\nnew times of minima for both the systems were derived and collected from the\ndata obtained by automatic and robotic telescopes. This allowed us to study the\nlong-term period changes in these systems for the first time. From the light\ncurve analysis, we derived the first rough estimates of the physical properties\nof these systems. We find that the analyzed systems are somewhat similar to\neach other. Both contain low-mass components of similar types, both are close\nto the Sun, both have short orbital period, and both contain another low-mass\ncompanions on longer orbits of a few years. In the case of GK Boo, both\ncomponents are probably of K3 spectral type, while the distant companion is\nprobably a late M star. The light curve of GK Boo is asymmetric, which probably\ncauses the shift in the secondary minima in the O-C diagram. System AE For\ncomprises two K7 stars, and the third body is a possible brown dwarf with a\nminimal mass of only about 47 Jupiter Mass. We succeed in completing period and\nlight curve analyses of both systems, although a more detailed spectroscopic\nanalysis is needed to confirm the physical parameters of the components to a\nhigher accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 13:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-25"}

If TC exhibits an extreme walking, TD mass is\nparametrically much smaller than that of techni-fermions (around 1 TeV), while\nits decay constant is comparable to the cutoff scale of walking TC. We analyze\nthe light, decoupled TD as a dark matter candidate and study cosmological\nproductions of TD, both thermal and non-thermal, in the early Universe. The\nthermal population is governed dominantly by single TD production processes\ninvolving vertices breaking the scale symmetry, while the non-thermal\npopulation is by the vacuum misalignment and is accumulated via harmonic and\ncoherent oscillations of misaligned classical TD fields. The non-thermal\npopulation turns out to be dominant and large enough to explain the abundance\nof presently observed dark matter, while the thermal population is highly\nsuppressed due to the large TD decay constant. Several cosmological and\nastrophysical limits on the light, decoupled TD are examined to find that the\nTD mass is constrained to be in a range between 0.01 eV and 500 eV. From the\ncombined constraints on cosmological productions and astrophysical\nobservations, we find that the light, decoupled TD can be a good dark matter\ncandidate with the mass around a few hundreds of eV for typical models of\n(extreme) walking TC. We finally mention possible designated experiments to\ndetect the TD dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 14:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 10:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In particular, the Yukawa coupling is expected to show some periodic and\nnon-linear behavior as the function of the Higgs VEV. For a specific choice of\nthe VEV, the Yukawa coupling of KK zero mode fermion even vanishes. On the\nother hand, the Yukawa coupling is originally provided by gauge interaction,\nwhich is linear in the Higgs field.

Detection as a wave is\ncontingent on the atom interacting much more strongly with the macroscopic\ndetector as a whole than with its microscopic constituents. This requirement\nmay be more difficult to meet with electrons, protons, neutrons or photons than\nwith atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 21:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-26"}
