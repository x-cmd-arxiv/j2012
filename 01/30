However, to define it quantum mechanically,\none is forced to regularize it since perturbative loop diagrams are not\nwell-defined due to presence of ultraviolet divergences stemming from\nintegration in the vicinity of the cusps. A regularization that is adopted by\npractitioners by allowing one to use spinor helicity formalism, on the one\nhand, and systematically go to higher orders of perturbation theory is based on\na version of dimensional regularization, known as Four-Dimensional Helicity\nscheme. Recently it was demonstrated that its use for the super Wilson loop at\none loop breaks both conformal symmetry and Poincare supersymmetry. Presently,\nwe exhibit the origin for these effects and demonstrate how one can undo this\nbreaking. The phenomenon is alike the one emerging in renormalization group\nmixing of conformal operators in conformal theories when one uses dimensional\nregularization. The rotation matrix to the diagonal basis is found by means of\ncomputing the anomaly in the Ward identity for the conformal boost. Presently,\nwe apply this ideology to the super Wilson loop. We compute the one-loop\nconformal anomaly for the super Wilson loop and find that the anomaly depends\non its Grassmann coordinates. By subtracting this anomalous contribution from\nthe super Wilson loop we restore its interpretation as a dual description for\nreduced non-MHV amplitudes which are expressed in terms of superconformal\ninvariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2012 20:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this work we revisit an\nalternative model, the scalar field dark matter (SFDM) model, which proposes\nthat the galactic haloes form by condensation of a scalar field (SF) very early\nin the Universe, i.e., in this model the haloes of galaxies are astronomical\nBose-Einstein Condensate drops of SF. On the other hand, large-scale structures\nlike clusters or superclusters of galaxies form similar to the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel, by hierarchy, thus all the predictions of the $\\Lambda$CDM model at\ncosmological scales are reproduced by SFDM. This model predicts that all galaxy\nhaloes must be very similar and exist for higher redshifts than in the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. In the first part of this review we revisit the\ncosmological evolution of SFDM model with a scalar potential\n$m^2\\Phi^2/2+\\lambda\\Phi^4/4$ with two different frameworks: the field and\nfluid approach. The scalar fluctuations have an oscillating growing mode and\ntherefore, this kind of dark matter could lead to the early formation of\ngravitational structures in the Universe.

The mean value of the\nlogarithmic inner density slopes is $\\alpha = - $0.27 $\\pm$ 0.18 and we show\nthat the recent observation of the constant dark matter central surface density\ncan be reproduced.

It was found that the angular\nmomentum vectors of dark matter haloes at high redshift have a weak tendency to\nbe orthogonal to filaments and high mass haloes have a stronger orthogonal\nalignment than low mass haloes. Since z=1, the spins of low mass haloes have\nbecome weakly aligned parallel to filaments, whereas high mass haloes kept\ntheir orthogonal alignment. This recent parallel alignment of low mass haloes\ncasts doubt on tidal torque theory as the sole mechanism for the build up of\nangular momentum.

At the primary venue, trading yields a linear price impact. In the dark\npool, no price impact costs arise but order execution is uncertain, modeled by\na multi-dimensional Poisson process. We characterize the costs of trading by a\nlinear-quadratic functional which incorporates both the price impact costs of\ntrading at the primary exchange and the market risk of the position. The\nliquidation constraint implies a singularity of the value function of the\nresulting minimization problem at the terminal time T. Via the HJB equation and\na quadratic ansatz, we obtain a candidate for the value function which is the\nlimit of a sequence of solutions of initial value problems for a matrix\ndifferential equation. We show that this limit exists by using an appropriate\nmatrix inequality and a comparison result for Riccati matrix equations.\nAdditionally, we obtain upper and lower bounds of the solutions of the initial\nvalue problems, which allow us to prove a verification theorem. If a single\nasset position is to be liquidated, the investor slowly trades out of her\nposition at the primary venue, with the remainder being placed in the dark pool\nat any point in time.

We can\nunderstand qualitatively this effect in a heuristic picture, by thinking that\nall dimensions, both visible and extra have an equal sharing of the curvature\ncaused by $\\Lambda$, in this case when increasing the overall number of\ndimensions by adding $N$ extra dimensions, then if $N$ is large, the visible\ndimensions do not have to curve too much, hence a small four dimensional vacuum\nenergy follows.

The HCAL is about 5 interaction\nlength thick, and ECAL is about 1 interaction length thick. For example, an\neighty GeV hadron, it is only 95% energy will be contained in ECAL plus HCAL.\nWe need a topological reconstruction of the leakage. This has been studied with\nexperimental data collected using the CALICE prototypes, during the 2007 test\nbeam campaign at CERN. The complete setup of the experiment consisted of a\nsilicon-tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter, an analog scintillator-steel\nhadron calorimeter and a scintillator-steel tail catcher. Events collected\nusing pion beams in the energy range 8-100 GeV are selected and compared to the\nMonte Carlo simulations. While the leakage from the full setup is negligible,\nwhen removing the tail catcher information either partly or completely the\nenergy loss becomes significant and affects the performance. The average\nmeasured energy decreases below the expected beam energy and the resolution\ndeteriorates. A correction to the leakage was implemented for pions. The\nresults obtained show that the correction is powerful in restoring the mean\nvalue of the measured energy distributions back to the expected beam energy,\nwith an accuracy at the 1-2% level over the whole energy range. The relative\nimprovement on the resolution is about 25% at 80 GeV, decreasing at lower\nenergies together with the impact of the leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 15:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}
