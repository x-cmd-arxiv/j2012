As cores are often embedded in filaments, it is important to\nunderstand how line profiles from such systems differ from those of isolated\ncores. We perform radiative transfer calculations on a hydrodynamic simulation\nof a molecular cloud in order to model line emission from collapsing cores\nembedded in filaments. We model two optically thick lines, CS(2-1) and\nHCN(1-0), and one optically thin line, N2H+(1-0), from three embedded cores. In\nthe hydrodynamic simulation, gas self-gravity, turbulence, and bulk flows\ncreate filamentary regions within which cores form. Though the filaments have\nlarge dispersions, the N2H+(1-0) lines indicate subsonic velocities within the\ncores. We find that the observed optically thick line profiles of CS(2-1) and\nHCN(1-0) vary drastically with viewing angle. In over 50% of viewing angles,\nthere is no sign of a blue asymmetry, an idealised signature of infall motions\nin an isolated spherical collapsing core. Profiles which primarily trace the\ncores, with little contribution from the surrounding filament, are\ncharacterised by a systematically higher HCN(1-0) peak intensity. The N2H+(1-0)\nlines do not follow this trend. We demonstrate that red asymmetric profiles are\nalso feasible in the optically thick lines, due to emission from the filament\nor one-sided accretion flows onto the core. We conclude that embedded cores may\nfrequently undergo collapse without showing a blue asymmetric profile, and that\nobservational surveys including filamentary regions may underestimate the\nnumber of collapsing cores if based solely on profile shapes of optically thick\nlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 16:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The n-solvable filtration of\nthe topological knot concordance group, due to Cochran-Orr-Teichner, may be\ncomplete in the sense that any knot in the intersection of its terms may well\nbe topologically slice. However, the natural extension of this filtration to\nwhat is called the n-solvable filtration of the smooth knot concordance group,\nis unsatisfactory because any topologically slice knot lies in every term of\nthe filtration. To ameliorate this we investigate a new filtration, {B_n}, that\nis simultaneously a refinement of the n-solvable filtration and a\ngeneralization of notions of positivity studied by Gompf and Cochran. We show\nthat each B_n/B_{n+1} has infinite rank. But our primary interest is in the\ninduced filtration, {T_n}, on the subgroup, T, of knots that are topologically\nslice. We prove that T/T_0 is large, detected by gauge-theoretic invariants and\nthe tau, s, and epsilon-invariants; while the non-triviliality of T_0/T_1 can\nbe detected by certain d-invariants. All of these concordance obstructions\nvanish for knots in T_1. Nonetheless, going beyond this, our main result is\nthat T_1/T_2 has positive rank. Moreover under a \"weak homotopy-ribbon\"\ncondition, we show that each T_n/T_{n+1} has positive rank. These results\nsuggest that, even among topologically slice knots, the fundamental group is\nresponsible for a wide range of complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 17:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 15:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

On comet 1P/Halley the Cameron (1-0) band\nhas been observed by International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) on several days\nin March 1986. A coupled chemistry-emission model is developed for comet\n1P/Halley to assess the importance of various production and loss mechanisms of\nCO(a3pi) and to calculate the intensity of Cameron band emission on different\ndays of IUE observation. Two different solar EUV flux models, EUVAC of Richards\net al. (1994) and SOLAR2000 of Tobiska (2004), and different relative\nabundances of CO and CO2, are used to evaluate the role of photon and\nphotoelectron in producing CO molecule in a3pi state in the cometary coma. It\nis found that in comet 1P/Halley 60--70% of the total intensity of the Cameron\nband emission is contributed by electron impact excitation of CO and CO2, while\nthe contribution from photodissociative excitation of CO2 is small (20--30%).\nThus, in the comets where CO and CO2 relative abundances are comparable, the\nCameron band emission is largely governed by electron impact excitation of CO,\nand not by the photodissociative excitation of CO2 as assumed earlier. Model\ncalculated Cameron band 1-0 emission intensity (40 R) is consistent with the\nobserved IUE slit-averaged brightness (37 +/- 6 R) using EUVAC model solar flux\non 13 March 1986, and also on other days of observations.

Without introducing any new parameters we are able unify\ninflation and Dark Matter using a scalar field phi that accounts for inflation\nat an early epoch while it gives a Dark Matter WIMP particle at low energies.\nAfter inflation our universe must be reheated and we must have a long period of\nradiation dominated before the epoch of Dark Matter. Typically the inflaton\ndecays while it oscillates around the minimum of its potential. If the inflaton\ndecay is not complete or sufficient then the remaining energy density of the\ninflaton after reheating must be fine tuned to give the correct amount of Dark\nMatter. An essential feature here, is that Dark Matter-Inflaton particle is\nproduced at low energies without fine tuning or new parameters. This process\nuses the same coupling g as for the inflaton decay. Once the field phi becomes\nnon-relativistic it will decouple as any WIMP particle, since n_phi is\nexponentially suppressed. The correct amount of Dark Matter determines the\ncross section and we have a constraint between the coupling $g$ and the mass\n$m_o$ of phi. The unification scheme we present here has four free parameters,\ntwo for the scalar potential V(phi) given by the inflation parameter lambda of\nthe quartic term and the mass m_o. The other two parameters are the coupling\n$g$ between the inflaton phi and a scalar filed varphi and the coupling h\nbetween varphi with standard model particles psi or chi. These four parameters\nare already present in models of inflation and reheating process, without\nconsidering Dark Matter. Therefore, our unification scheme does not increase\nthe number of parameters and it accomplishes the desired unification between\nthe inflaton and Dark Matter for free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 17:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A general expression for the force acting per unit\narea of a charged domain wall carrying free charge is derived. It is shown\nthat, in proper ferroelectrics, the free charge carried by the wall is\ndependent on the size of the adjacent domains. As a result, it was found that\nthe mobility of such domain wall (with respect to the applied field) is\nsensitive to the parameters of the domain pattern containing this wall. The\nproblem of the force acting on a planar charged 180-degree domain wall normal\nto the polarization direction in a periodic domain pattern in a proper\nferroelectric is analytically solved in terms of Landau theory. It is shown\nthat, in small applied fields (in the linear regime), the forces acting on\nwalls in such pattern increase with decreasing the wall spacing, the direction\nof the forces coinciding with those for the case of the corresponding neutral\nwalls. At the same time, for large enough wall spacings and large enough\nfields, these forces can be of the opposite sign. It is shown that the domain\npattern considered is unstable in a defect-free ferroelectric. The poling of a\ncrystal containing such pattern, stabilized by the pinning pressure, is also\nconsidered. It is shown that, except for a special situation, the presence of\ncharge domain walls can make poling more difficult. It is demonstrated that the\nresults obtained are also applicable to zig-zag walls under the condition that\nthe zig-zag amplitude is much smaller than the domain wall spacing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 19:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

Our results can\nbe summarized as follows: first, and contrary to observations of field\ngalaxies, these cluster galaxies are distributed almost equally amongst the\nthree main types of disk galaxy luminosity profiles (I/II/III), indicating that\nthe formation and/or survival of Type II breaks is suppressed within the\ncluster environment. Second, we find examples of statistically-significant\ninversions (\"U-shapes\") in the age profiles of all three disk galaxy types,\nreminescent of predictions from high-resolution simulations of\nclassically-truncated Type II disks in the field. These features characterize\nthe age profiles for only about a third (<36%) of each disk galaxy type in our\nsample. An even smaller fraction of cluster disks (~11% of the total sample),\nexhibit age profiles which decrease outwards (i.e., negative age gradients).\nInstead, flat and/or positive age gradients prevail (>50%) within our Type I,\nII and III sub-samples. These observations thus suggest that while stellar\nmigrations and inside-out growth can play a significant role in the evolution\nof all disk galaxy types, other factors contributing to the evolution of\ngalaxies can overwhelm the predicted signatures of these processes. We\ninterpret our observations through a scenario whereby Virgo cluster disk\ngalaxies formed initially like their bretheren in the field but which, upon\nfalling into the cluster, were transformed into their present state through\nexternal processes linked to the environment.

If\nthe universe today exists in a false vacuum, there will be a non-zero\nprobability to tunnel to the true vacuum state of the universe. Should this\ntransition occur elsewhere in the universe, bubbles of true vacuum will\nnucleate and expand outwards. Bubbles that nucleate in the hot dense plasma of\nthe early universe will feel a friction from the plasma that acts against the\nexpansion of the bubble, until the bubble eventually reaches a steady state\nexpansion. Unlike many bubble formation scenarios where the bubble wall\nvelocity rapidly approaches the speed of light, friction from the hot\nprimordial plasma can cause the expanding bubble wall to reach a terminal\nvelocity while gravity waves are free to propagate through the hot dense plasma\nat the speed of light.

We derive a\nmaster formula that relates the SCET resummation to the QCD result for any\nchoice of mu_s. We then use it first, to show that if SCET resummation is\nperformed in N-Mellin moment space by suitable choice of mu_s it is equivalent\nto the standard perturbative approach. Next, we show that if SCET resummation\nis performed by choosing for mu_s a partonic momentum variable, the\nperturbative result for partonic resummed cross-sections is again reproduced,\nbut like its standard perturbative counterpart it is beset by divergent\nbehaviour at the endpoint. Finally, using the master formula we show that when\nmu_s is chosen as a hadronic momentum variable the SCET and standard approach\nare related through a multiplicative (convolutive) factor, which contains the\ndependence on the Landau pole and associated divergence. This factor depends on\nthe luminosity in a non-universal way; it lowers by one power of log the\naccuracy of the resummed result, but it is otherwise subleading if one assumes\nthe luminosity not to contain logarithmically enhanced terms. Therefore, the\nSCET approach can be turned into a prescription to remove the Landau pole from\nthe perturbative result, but the price to pay for this is the reduction by one\nlogarithmic power of the accuracy at each order and the need to make\nassumptions on the parton luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 15:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We propose to improve this situation by obtaining\nmore observations of high-redshift hosts to better understand their properties\nand help enable us to use GRBs as probes of the high-redshift universe. We\nperformed very deep photometric observations of three high-redshift GRB host\ngalaxies, GRB 080913 at z =6.7, GRB 060927 at z =5.5 and GRB 060522 at z =5.1.\nIn addition, we completed deep spectroscopic observations of the GRB080913 host\ngalaxy with X-Shooter at the VLT to search for Ly-alpha emission.

The sample of GRB host galaxies studied in this paper\nconsists of four out of the five spectroscopically confirmed GRBs at z>5.\nDespite our presented observations being the deepest ever reported of\nhigh-redshift GRB host galaxies, we do not detect any of the hosts, neither in\nphotometry nor in spectroscopy in the case of GRB 080913. These observations\nindicate that the GRB host galaxies seem to evolve with time and to have lower\nSFRs at z >5 than they have at z<1. In addition, the host galaxy of GRB 080913\nat z =6.7 does not show Ly-alpha emission. While the measured properties of the\ngalaxies in our sample agree with the properties of the general galaxy\npopulation at z>5, our observations are not sufficiently sensitive to allow us\nto infer further conclusions on whether this specific population is\nrepresentative of the general one.

Here we discuss the predictions of two\nstate-of-the-art hierarchical galaxy formation models in which BHs grow via\nmergers and, in one, also via disk instability. Our aim is to understand if the\nwealth of new data on local BH demography is consistent with standard models.\nWe follow the merger trees of representative subsamples of BHs and compute the\nfractional contributions of different processes to the final BH mass. We show\nthat the model in which BHs always closely follow the growth of their host\nbulges, also during late disk instabilities (i.e., bars), produces too narrow a\ndistribution of BHs at fixed stellar mass to account for the numerous low-mass\nBHs now detected in later-type galaxies. Models with a looser connection\nbetween BH growth and bar instability instead predict the existence of a larger\nnumber of undermassive BHs, in better agreement with the observations. The\nscatter in the updated local BH-bulge mass relation (with no restriction on\ngalaxy type) appears to be quite large when including later-type systems, but\nit can still be managed to be reproduced within current hierarchical models.\nHowever, the fuelling of BHs during the late bar-instability mode needs to be\nbetter quantified/improved to properly fit the data. We conclude discussing how\nthe possibly large number of BHs in later type galaxies demands for an in-depth\nrevision of the local BH mass function and its modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2012 22:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

For simulations with net vertical\nmagnetic flux, the MRI continuously amplifies the magnetic field until the\nAlfv\\'en velocity, v_A, is comparable to the speed of light, c (independent of\nthe initial value of v_A/c). This is consistent with the lack of saturation of\nMRI channel modes in analogous axisymmetric MHD simulations. The amplification\nof the magnetic field by the MRI generates a significant pressure anisotropy in\nthe plasma (with the perpendicular pressure being larger than the parallel\npressure). We find that this pressure anisotropy in turn excites mirror modes\nand that the volume averaged pressure anisotropy remains near the threshold for\nmirror mode excitation.

The axisymmetric\nturbulence in a central volume of the size of the inertial scale is shown to\nhave negligible mean and shear. The Taylor Reynolds number is about 480.\n  The influence of large scale anisotropy on the turbulence is examined from\nthree aspects, namely the velocity structure functions, the velocity\ncorrelation functions, and the integral lengths. The directional dependence of\ntwo different second order transverse structure functions, in which one of them\nhas separations stretched along the axis of symmetry of the turbulence and the\nother one normal to it, is studied. It is shown that the inertial range scaling\nexponents, determined using the extended-self-similarity procedure, and the\nKolmogorov constants of the two structure functions are unaffected by the\ndirection in which the structure functions are measured.\n  Finally, it is found that, except in the isotropic case, the second order\ntransverse velocity correlation functions deviate from each other at the large\nscale with increasing anisotropy. A self-similarity argument similar to one\nfound in the study of critical phenomena is proposed.

To elucidate the reasons for this emission, we\nmounted a multiwavelength campaign in 2010 centered around 4 XMM observations.\nThe observational techniques included long baseline optical interferometry\n(LBOI), monitoring by an Automated Photometric Telescope and Halpha\nobservations. Because gamma Cas is also known to be in a binary, we measured\nHalpha radial velocities and redetermined its period as 203.55+/-0.2 days and\nan eccentricity near zero. The LBOI observations suggest that the star's\ndecretion disk was axisymmetric in 2010, has an inclination angle near 45^o,\nand a larger radius than previously reported. The Be star began an \"outburst\"\nat the beginning of our campaign, made visible by a disk brightening and\nreddening during our campaign. Our analyses of the new high resolution spectra\ndisclosed many attributes found from spectra obtained in 2001 (Chandra) and\n2004 (XMM). As well as a dominant hot 14 keV thermal component, these familiar\nones included: (i) a fluorescent feature of Fe K stronger than observed at\nprevious times, (ii) strong lines of N VII and Ne XI lines indicative of\noverabundances, and (iii) a subsolar Fe abundance from K-shell lines but a\nsolar abundance from L-shell ions. We also found that 2 absorption columns are\nrequired to fit the continuum. While the first one maintained its historical\naverage of 1X10^21 cm^-2, the second was very large and doubled to 7.4X10^23\ncm^-2 during our X-ray observations. Although we found no clear relation\nbetween this column density and orbital phase, it correlates well with the disk\nbrightening and reddening both in the 2010 and earlier observations. Thus, the\ninference from this study is that much (perhaps all?) of the X-ray emission\nfrom this source originates behind matter ejected by gamma Cas into our line of\nsight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 01:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It is well-known that truthtelling is not a\ndominant strategy in this auction and that inefficient equilibria can arise. In\nthis paper we study the space of equilibria in GSP, and quantify the efficiency\nloss that can arise in equilibria under a wide range of sources of uncertainty,\nas well as in the full information setting. The traditional Bayesian game\nmodels uncertainty in the valuations (types) of the participants. The\nGeneralized Second Price (GSP) auction gives rise to a further form of\nuncertainty: the selection of quality factors resulting in uncertainty about\nthe behavior of the underlying ad allocation algorithm. The bounds we obtain\napply to both forms of uncertainty, and are robust in the sense that they apply\nunder various perturbations of the solution concept, extending to models with\ninformation asymmetries and bounded rationality in the form of learning\nstrategies.\n  We present a constant bound (2.927) on the factor of the efficiency loss\n(\\emph{price of anarchy}) of the corresponding game for the Bayesian model of\npartial information about other participants and about ad quality factors. For\nthe full information setting, we prove a surprisingly low upper bound of 1.282\non the price of anarchy over pure Nash equilibria, nearly matching a lower\nbound of 1.259 for the case of three advertisers. Further, we do not require\nthat the system reaches equilibrium, and give similarly low bounds also on the\nquality degradation for any no-regret learning outcome. Our conclusion is that\nthe number of advertisers in the auction has almost no impact on the price of\nanarchy, and that the efficiency of GSP is very robust with respect to the\nbelief and rationality assumptions imposed on the participants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 03:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 00:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}

In this\npaper we discuss how the noise due to the potential disorder and the various\nartifacts in the raw FTSTS data can be handled by a simple cross-sectional\nanalysis with an isotropic Gaussian averaging and modeling the set-point effect\nby an energy-independent and position-dependent factor to the density of states\nfunction. The result shows that in the cross-sectional presentation an enhanced\ncorrelation exists between the FTSTS data and the theoretical simulation even\nwithout the accurate model for the tunneling and the scattering matrix elements\nand without the assumption for particle-hole symmetry, suggesting that it can\nbe a new starting point of a more robust quantum physical analysis framework\nappropriate for the phase transition study in the high-Tc superconductors and\nother strongly correlated electron systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 05:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

Since the optimization of US based on the proposed\ncriterion is infeasible, a greedy algorithm of data-dependent US is proposed to\nperform the optimization approximately. An overhead issue arises in fast fading\nchannels: On every update of US, the transmitter might inform each user whether\nhe/she has been selected, using a certain fraction of resources. This overhead\nresults in a significant rate loss for fast fading channels. In order to\ncircumvent this overhead issue, iterative detection and decoding schemes are\nproposed on the basis of belief propagation.

Basing on\na strong-coupled structure of dense baryonic matter encoded in the skyrmion\ncrystal approach with a topology change and resorting to the notion of\ngeneralized HLS (hidden local symmetry) in hadronic interactions, we address a\nvariety of hitherto unexplored issues of nuclear interactions associated with\nthe symmetry energy, i.e., kaon condensation and hyperons, possible topology\nchange in dense matter, nuclear tensor forces, conformal symmetry and chiral\nsymmetry etc in the EoS of dense compact-star matter. One of the surprising\nresults coming from the hidden local symmetry structure that is distinct from\nwhat is given by standard phenomenological approaches is that at high density,\nbaryonic matter is driven by RG flow to the \"dilaton-limit fixed point (DLFP)\"\nconstrained by \"mended symmetries.\" We further propose how to formulate kaon\ncondensation and hyperons in compact-star matter in a framework anchored on a\nsingle effective Lagrangian by treating hyperons as the Callan-Klebanov\nkaon-skyrmion bound states simulated on crystal lattice. This formulation\nsuggests that hyperons can figure in the stellar matter -- if at all -- when or\nafter kaons condense, in contrast to the standard phenomenological approaches\nwhere the hyperons appear as the first strangeness degree of freedom in matter\nthereby suppressing or delaying kaon condensation.

I here argue that\nsome effort should be directed toward manifestations of laws that are already\nknown, but whose implications are poorly understood in OPERA-type contexts. My\npreferred example of this sort is that the OPERA result might be the first\nobservation of a previously unnoticed effect, belonging to a family of effects\nwhich includes those responsible for the well-known peculiar properties of the\n\"tunneling time\". Tentative support for this specific hypothesis comes from the\npresence of evanescence and \"postselection\", and the observation that the\nfraction of neutrinos absorbed in rock on the way from CERN to LNGS is of a few\nparts in $10^5$, i.e. comparable to the fraction of the overall travel time by\nwhich OPERA neutrinos are found to reach LNGS earlier than expected. This leads\nme to stress that the OPERA result is still consistent with subluminality of a\nsuitably \"postselection-corrected\" velocity. Adopting the popular (but here\ndisfavored) interpretation of the OPERA result as a \"signal velocity\" one could\nobtain superluminal values of the postselection-corrected velocity in some\ntechnologically feasible OPERA-like setups, a prediction which I propose to\ntest. I also propose a semi-heuristic formula for the \"rock dwell time\" and\nfind that it gives a result in rough agreement with the OPERA travel-time\nmeasurements. This suggests that effects similar to the ones found for OPERA's\nmuon neutrinos should also be found, but with tangibly different magnitude, for\nmuon anti-neutrinos under similar experimental conditions. And I argue that,\nwhether or not they end up being relevant for the OPERA anomaly, the effects\nhere considered should be significant in the Planck-scale realm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 10:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

One-particle scattering amplitude between two covariantly\nconserved sources mediated by a graviton exchange is found at tree-level in $D$\ndimensional (Anti)-de Sitter and flat spacetimes for the most general quadratic\ncurvature theory augmented with the Pauli-Fierz mass term. From the amplitude\nexpression, the Newtonian potential energies are calculated for various cases.\nAlso, from this amplitude and the propagator structure, a three dimensional\nunitary theory is identified. In the second part of the thesis, the found three\ndimensional unitary theory is studied in more detail from a canonical point of\nview. The general higher order action is written in terms of gauge-invariant\nfunctions both in flat and de Sitter backgrounds. The analysis is extended by\nadding static sources, spinning masses and the gravitational Chern-Simons term\nseparately to the theory in the case of flat spacetime. For all cases the\nmicroscopic spectrum and the masses are found. In the discussion of curved\nspacetime, the masses are found in the relativistic and non-relativistic\nlimits. In the Appendix, some useful calculations that are frequently used in\nthe bulk of the thesis are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 11:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

The moments\nof the normalized intensity can be used to define the shift of the resonance\nfrequency induced by the interactions and the line width independently of the\nshape of the spectral line. These moments can be calculated exactly as\nfunctions of temperature and strength of an external magnetic field, as long as\nthe field is directed along the symmetry axis of the chain. This allows us to\ndiscuss the line width and the resonance shift for a given magnetic field in\nthe full range of possible anisotropy parameters. For the interpretation of\nthese data we need a qualitative knowledge of the line shape which we obtain\nfrom fully numerical calculations for finite chains. Exact analytical results\non the line shape are out of reach of current theories. From our numerical work\nwe could extract, however, an empirical parameter-free model of the line shape\nat high temperatures which is extremely accurate over a wide range of\nanisotropy parameters and is exact at the free fermion point and at the\nisotropic point. Another prediction of the line shape can be made in the\nzero-temperature and zero magnetic field limit, where the sufficiently\nanisotropic model shows strong absorption. For anisotropy parameters in the\nmassive phase we derive the exact two-spinon contribution to the spectral line.\nFrom the intensity sum rule it can be estimated that this contribution accounts\nfor more than 80% of the spectral weight if the anisotropy parameter is\nmoderately above its value at the isotropic point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 12:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

Binaries with separations of 100--1000 au are\nprevalent in the Solar neighborhood; at these separations planet formation\naround a binary member may largely proceed as if around a single star. During\nthe early dynamical evolution of a planetary system, planet--planet scattering\ncan eject planets from a star's grasp. In a binary, the motion of a planet\nejected from one star has effectively entered a restricted three-body system\nconsisting of itself and the two stars, and the equations of motion of the\nthree body problem will apply as long as the ejected planet remains far from\nthe remaining planets. Depending on its energy, escape from the binary as a\nwhole may be impossible or delayed until the three-body approximation breaks\ndown, and further close interactions with its planetary siblings boost its\nenergy when it passes close to its parent star. Until then this planet may be\nable to transition from the space around one star to the other, and chaotically\n`bounce' back and forth.

It is an\ninformation-theoretic generalization of joint controllability (influence on\nenvironment) and observability (measurement by sensors) of the environment by\nthe agent, both controllability and observability being usually defined in\ncontrol theory as the dimensionality of the control/observation spaces.

The\ncontinuous state space is addressed by Monte-Carlo approximation; the unknown\ntransitions are addressed by model learning and prediction for which we apply\nGaussian processes regression with iterated forecasting. In a number of\nwell-known continuous control tasks we examine the dynamics induced by\nempowerment and include an application to exploration and online model\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 15:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

If D passes\nthrough the n(n-1)/2 vertices of a complete polygon with n sides tangent to C\nthen D passes through the vertices of infinitely many such polygons.\" According\nto Marcel Berger this theorem is the nicest result about the geometry of\nconics. Even if it is, there are few proofs of it. To my knowledge there are\nonly three. The first proof, published in 1822 and based on infinitesimal\ndeformations, is due to Poncelet. Later, Jacobi proposed a new proof based on\nfinite order points on elliptic curves; his proof, certainly the most famous,\nis explained in a modern way and in detail by Griffiths and Harris. In 1870\nWeyr proved a Poncelet theorem in space (more precisely for two quadrics) that\nimplies the one above when one quadric is a cone; this proof is explained by\nBarth and Bauer. Our aim in this short note is to involve vector bundles\ntechniques to propose a new proof of this celebrated result. Poncelet did not\nappreciate Jacobi's for the reason that it was too far from the geometric\nintuition. I guess that he would not appreciate our proof either for the same\nreason.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 08:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-02"}
