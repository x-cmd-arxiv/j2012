The broadcast cycle -- a\nsequence of frames sorted by the keys and permuted by $k$-bit reversal -- is\ntransmitted in a round robin fashion by the broadcaster. At arbitrary time\nduring the transmission, the receiver may start a simple protocol that reports\nto him all the frames with the keys that are contained in a specified interval\nof the key values $[K', K\"]$. RBO receives at most $2 k + 1$ other frames' keys\nbefore receiving the first key from $[K', K\"]$ or noticing that there are no\nsuch keys in the broadcast cycle.

The considered interaction among the SUs\nis characterized by the following three features. First, since the SUs are\ndecentralized, they are selfish and aim to maximize their own long-term payoffs\nfrom utilizing the network rather than obeying the prescribed allocation of a\ncentralized controller. Second, the SUs interact with each other repeatedly and\nthey can coexist in the system for a long time. Third, the SUs have limited and\nimperfect monitoring ability: they only observe whether the IT constraints are\nviolated, and their observation is imperfect due to the erroneous measurements.\nTo capture these features, we model the interaction of the SUs as a repeated\ngame with imperfect monitoring. We first characterize the set of Pareto optimal\npayoffs that can be achieved by deviation-proof spectrum sharing policies,\nwhich are policies that the selfish users find it in their interest to comply\nwith. Next, for any given payoff in this set, we show how to construct a\ndeviation-proof policy to achieve it.

In the presence of strong\nmulti-user interference, our policy outperforms existing spectrum sharing\npolicies that dictate users to transmit at constant power levels\nsimultaneously.

We present an\nanalysis of the kinematics properties of 50 galaxies with 0.9 < z < 1.6 from\nthe MASSIV sample observed with SINFONI/VLT with 4.5x10^9 Msun < M < 1.7x10^11\nMsun and 6 Msun/yr < SFR < 300 Msun/yr.

This is placing a lower limit on the fraction of interacting galaxies.\nWe find that at least 44% of the galaxies display ordered rotation whereas at\nleast 35% are non-rotating objects. All rotators except one are compatible with\nrotation-dominated (Vmax/sigma > 1) systems. Non-rotating objects are mainly\nsmall objects (Re < 4 kpc).

These functions are defined as\nexpansions into MacDonald polynomials, and their dependence on k is entirely\ncaptured by the action of the cut-and-join operator, like in the HOMFLY case.\nWe suggest a simple description of the coefficients in these character\nexpansions, by expanding the initial (at k=0) conditions for the k-evolution\ninto the new auxiliary basis, this time provided by the Hall-Littlewood\npolynomials, which, hence, play a role in the description of the dual\nm-evolution.

This method, which we\nrecently proposed and demonstrated, consists of driving two\ntransversely-coupled quantum bits (qubits) with a driving field that is\nresonant with one of the two qubits. For specific relative amplitudes and\nphases of the driving field felt by the two qubits, one of the two transitions\nin the degenerate pair is darkened, or in other words, becomes forbidden by\neffective selection rules. At these driving conditions, the evolution of the\ntwo-qubit state realizes a CNOT gate. The gate speed is found to be limited\nonly by the coupling energy J, which is the fundamental speed limit for any\nentangling gate. Numerical simulations show that at gate speeds corresponding\nto 0.48J and 0.07J, the gate fidelity is 99% and 99.99%, respectively, and\nincreases further for lower gate speeds. In addition, the effect of\nhigher-lying energy levels and weak anharmonicity is studied, as well as the\nscalability of the method to systems of multiple qubits. We conclude that in\nall these respects this method is competitive with existing schemes for\ncreating entanglement, with the added advantages of being applicable for qubits\noperating at fixed frequencies (either by design or for exploitation of\ncoherence sweet-spots) and having the simplicity of microwave-only operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2012 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 21:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-25"}

The clusters span a range of Bautz-Morgan types and\nevolutionary stages and are representative of the global underlying\nintermediate L_X cluster sample. We define cluster membership using SDSS\nspectroscopic data and characterize the clusters by deriving new recession\nvelocities, velocity dispersions and other parameters for each.

In doing so, we describe a population of discordant points on the\ncolour-magnitude plane which are the result of photometric blending, dust and\nother causes. By fitting the clusters with Schechter functions to derive M*\nvalues in each SDSS passband, we combine the red sequence of the galaxy\nclusters together to form a composite sample.

In agreement with\nprevious studies, these colours are shown to systematically move blueward with\nincreasing distance from the cluster centres, or equivalently lower local\ngalaxy density, whilst the width of the red sequence increases. This supports\nthe idea that the galaxies at the outskirts of these clusters have younger\nluminosity-weighted ages than those at the core indicating their star formation\nhas been quenched more recently than in the core.

Current popular source candidates\ninclude unresolved star-forming galaxies, starburst galaxies, and blazars. In\nthis paper we calculate the EGB contribution from the interactions of cosmic\nrays accelerated by Type Ia supernovae (SNe), extending earlier work which only\nincluded core-collapse SNe. We consider Type Ia events in star-forming\ngalaxies, but also in quiescent galaxies that lack star formation. For\nstar-forming galaxies, consistently including Type Ia events makes little\nchange to the star-forming EGB prediction, so long as both SN types have the\nsame cosmic-ray acceleration efficiencies in star-forming galaxies. Thus, our\nupdated EGB estimate continues to show that star-forming galaxies can represent\na substantial portion of the signal measured by Fermi. For quiescent galaxies,\nconversely, we find a wide range of possibilities for the EGB contribution. The\ndominant uncertainty we investigated comes from the mass in hot gas, which\nprovides targets for cosmic rays; total gas masses are as yet poorly known,\nparticularly at larger radii. Additionally, the EGB estimation is very\nsensitive to the cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency and confinement, especially\nin quiescent galaxies. In the most optimistic allowed scenarios, quiescent\ngalaxies can be an important source of the EGB. In this case, star-forming\ngalaxies and quiescent galaxies together will dominate the EGB and leave little\nroom for other contributions. If other sources, such as blazars, are found to\nhave important contributions to the EGB, then either the gas mass or cosmic-ray\ncontent of quiescent galaxies must be significantly lower than in their\nstar-forming counterparts. In any case, improved Fermi EGB measurements will\nprovide important constraints on hot gas and cosmic rays in quiescent galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 07:58:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 08:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}

We study the\nstructure of the accretion disc in X1822-371 by modelling the phase-resolved\nspectra both in optical and X-ray regime.

The behaviour of the H_beta line\ncomplex implies that some of the accreting matter creates an outburst around\nthe accretion stream impact location and that the resulting outflow of matter\nmoves both away from the accretion disc and towards the centre of the disc.\nSuch behaviour can be explained by an almost isotropic outflow of matter from\nthe accretion stream impact region. The optical emission lines of HeII 4686 and\n5411 show double peaked profiles, typical for an accretion disc at high\ninclination. However, their velocities are slower than expected for an\naccretion disc in a system like X1822-371. This, combined with the fact that\nthe HeII emission lines do not get eclipsed during the partial eclipse in the\ncontinuum, suggests that the line emission does not originate in the orbital\nplane and is more likely to come from above the accretion disc, for example the\naccretion disc wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 09:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Implemented as a time-varying\nelectricity price in real-time, Demand Response has a direct impact on the\nunderlying energy market as well.

The effect of uncertainties in\nthe RER on the market equilibrium is then quantified, with and without\nreal-time pricing. Perturbation analysis methods are used to compare the\nequilibria in the nominal and perturbed markets. These markets are also\nanalyzed using a game-theoretic point of view. Sufficient conditions are\nderived for the existence of a unique Pure Nash Equilibrium in the nominal\nmarket. The perturbed market is analyzed using the concept of closeness of two\nstrategic games and the equilibria of close games.

Our results\nshow that unless the magnetization of GRB jets is extremely high, \\sigma > 100\nin the prompt emission zone, the magnetic model may still be compatible with\nthe observations. The main effect of reduced dissipation efficiency is merely\nan increase in the size of the dissipation zone and even for highly magnetised\nGRB jets this size may remain below the external shock radius, provided the\ncentral engine can emit magnetic shells on the time scale well below the\ntypical observed variability scale of one second. Our analytical and numerical\nresults suggest that magnetic shells begin strongly interact with each other\nwell before they reach the coasting radius. As the result, the impulsive jet in\nthe dissipation zone is best described not as a collection of shells but as a\ncontinuous highly magnetised flow with a high amplitude magnetosonic wave\ncomponent. How exactly the dissipated wave energy is distributed between the\nradiation and the bulk kinetic energy of radial jets depends on the relative\nrates of radiative and adiabatic cooling. In the fast radiative cooling regime,\nthe corresponding radiative efficiency can be as high as the wave contribution\nto their energy budget, independently of the magnetization. Moreover, after\nleaving the zone of prompt emission the jet may still remain\nPoynting-dominated, leading to weaker emission from the reverse shock compared\nto non-magnetic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 10:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We describe an\nimplementation of this method in Python targeting the IBM Blue Gene/P\nsupercomputer's PowerPC 450 core. This paper details the high-level design,\nconstruction, simulation, verification, and analysis of these kernels utilizing\na subset of the CPU's instruction set.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing several\nthree-dimensional stencil kernels over a variety of cached memory scenarios and\nanalyzing the mechanically scheduled variants, including a 27-point stencil\nachieving a 1.7x speedup over the best previously published results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 12:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

We make use of three different\nregularizations: the cutoff method, the complex contour integration method, and\nthe zeta-function method. The string model is relativistic, in the sense that\nthe velocity of sound is for each string piece set equal to the velocity of\nlight. In this sense the theory is analogous to the electromagnetic theory in a\ndielectric medium in which the product of permittivity and permeability is\nequal to unity (an isorefractive medium). We demonstrate how the formalism\nworks for a two-piece string, and for a 2N-piece string, and show how in the\nlatter case a compact recursion relation serves to facilitate the formalism\nconsiderably. The Casimir energy turns out to be negative, and the more so the\nlarger the number of pieces in the string. The two-piece string is quantized in\nD-dimensional spacetime, in the limit when the ratio between the two tensions\nis very small. We calculate the free energy and other thermodynamic quantities,\ndemonstrate scaling properties, and comment on the meaning of the Hagedorn\ncritical temperature for the two-piece string.

It induces flux variations which affect significantly\nthe transit depth determination and the derivations of planetary and stellar\nparameters. Furthermore, the colour dependence of stellar activity may\nsignificantly influence the characterization of planetary atmospheres. Here we\npresent a systematic approach to quantify the corresponding stellar flux\nvariations as a function of wavelength bands. We consider a star with spots\ncovering a given fraction of its disc and model the variability in the UBVRIJHK\nphotometric system and in the Spitzer/IRAC wavebands for dwarf stars from G to\nM spectral types. We compare activity-induced flux variations in different\npassbands with planetary transits and quantify how they affect the\ndetermination of the planetary radius and the analysis of the transmission\nspectroscopy in the study of planetary atmospheres. We suggest that the\nmonitoring of the systems by using broad band photometry, from visible to\ninfrared, helps to constraining activity effects. The ratio of the relative\nvariations of the stellar fluxes in short wavelength optical bands (e.g., U or\nB) to near infrared ones (e.g., J or K) can be used to distinguish starspot\nbrightness dips from planetary transits in a stellar light curve. In addition\nto the perturbations in the measurement of the planetary radius, we find that\nstarspots can affect the determination of the relative semimajor axis and the\ninclination of the planetary orbit which have a significant impact on the\nderivation of the stellar density from the transit light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 14:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this article,\nwe propose a highly efficient path following procedure for combination of any\nconvex loss function and a broad class of penalties.

A node is occupied if a lymphocyte clone of the\ncorresponding idiotype exists, otherwise it is empty. There is a continuous\ninflux of new B-lymphocytes of random idiotype from the bone marrow.\nB-lymphocytes are stimulated by cross-linking their receptors with\ncomplementary structures.

A new type of Double-Tapered Round (DTR) dowels is proposed, and\nthe performance of DTR dowels is compared to that of traditional cylindrical\ndowels. Linear Elastic (LE) analysis are performed in Abaqus (v-6.11) order to\nidentify the optimized geometry of DTR dowels that would achieve (1) highest\nload transfer across adjacent slabs through shear action, and (2) lowest\nbearing stresses on the concrete. LE analyses are complemented by nonlinear FE\nanalysis. The Riks method available in Abaqus/Standard, coupled with the\nConcrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model is used to simulate the degradation of\nconcrete surrounding both DTR the traditional cylindrical dowels. Results\nobtained show that the use of DTR dowels can reduce bearing stresses at the\nface of the joint by as much 2.2 times as compared to traditional cylindrical\ndowels. While adequate load-transfer is a crucial part for the proper\nperformance pavement structures, the load-transfer capacity of DTR dowels was\nmore effective over cylindrical dowels by as far as 116%. In the inelastic\nrange, even after significant concrete degradation and steel yielding, DTR\ndowels maintained a higher load-transfer capacity than traditional cylindrical\ndowels, and also presented lower amounts of differential deflections across\nconcrete floors. Finally, damage in the concrete matrix below the dowel was\nrelatively more confined for the case of DTR dowels, as compared to traditional\ncylindrical dowels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2012 12:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 12:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 09:19:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 03:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-27"}
