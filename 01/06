In order to investigate the effect of an\nenhanced carbon burning rate on massive star structure and nucleosynthesis, new\nstellar evolution models and their yields are presented exploring the impact of\nthree different 12C + 12C reaction rates. Non-rotating stellar models were\ngenerated using the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code and were later post-processed\nwith the NuGrid Multi-zone Post-Processing Network tool. The enhanced rate\ncauses core carbon burning to be ignited more promptly and at lower\ntemperature. This reduces the neutrino losses, which increases the core carbon\nburning lifetime. An increased carbon burning rate also increases the upper\ninitial mass limit for which a star exhibits a convective carbon core. Carbon\nshell burning is also affected, with fewer convective-shell episodes and\nconvection zones that tend to be larger in mass. Consequently, the chance of an\noverlap between the ashes of carbon core burning and the following carbon shell\nconvection zones is increased, which can cause a portion of the ashes of carbon\ncore burning to be included in the carbon shell. Therefore, during the\nsupernova explosion, the ejecta will be enriched by s-process nuclides\nsynthesized from the carbon core s process. The yields were used to estimate\nthe weak s-process component in order to compare with the solar system\nabundance distribution. The enhanced rate models were found to produce a\nsignificant proportion of Kr, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Pd and Cd in the weak\ncomponent, which is primarily the signature of the carbon-core s process.\nConsequently, it is shown that the production of isotopes in the Kr-Sr region\ncan be used to constrain the 12C + 12C rate using the current branching ratio\nfor a- and p-exit channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 17:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The model does not require detailed or explicit\ninformation about plasma profiles or geometry. Instead, this information is\nlumped in system variables, parameters and inputs. The model has an exact\nmathematical structure built from energy and flux conservation theorems,\npredicting the evolution and non linear interaction of the plasma current and\ninternal inductance as functions of the primary coil currents, plasma\nresistance, non-inductive current drive and the loop voltage at a specific\nlocation inside the plasma (equilibrium loop voltage). Loop voltage profile in\nthe plasma is substituted by a three-point discretization, and ordinary\ndifferential equations are used to predict the equilibrium loop voltage as\nfunction of the boundary and resistive loop voltages. This provides a model for\nequilibrium loop voltage evolution, which is reminiscent of the skin effect.\nThe order and parameters of this differential equation are determined\nempirically using system identification techniques. Fast plasma current\nmodulation experiments with Random Binary Signals (RBS) have been conducted in\nthe TCV tokamak to generate the required data for the analysis.

The frequent and prolonged gravitational encounters that occur in\ncompact groups affect the evolution of the constituent galaxies in a myriad of\nways, for example gas processing and star formation. Recently, a statistically\nsignificant \"gap\" has been discovered mid-infrared IRAC colorspace of compact\ngroup galaxies. This gap is not seen in field samples and is a new example of\nhow the compact group environment may affect the evolution of member galaxies.\nIn order to investigate the origin and nature of this gap, we have compiled a\nsample of 49 compact groups. We find that a statistically significant deficit\nof galaxies in this gap region of IRAC colorspace is persistant in this sample,\nlending support to the hypothesis that the compact group environment inhibits\nmoderate SSFRs. We note a curvature in the colorspace distribution, which is\nfully consistent with increasing dust temperature as the activity in a galaxy\nincreases. This full sample of 49 compact groups allows us to subdivide the\ndata according to physical properties of the groups. An analysis of these\nsubsamples indicates that neither projected physical diameter nor density show\na trend in colorspace within the values represented by this sample. We\nhypothesize that the apparent lack of a trend is due to the relatively small\nrange of properties in this sample. Thus, the relative influence of stochastic\neffects becomes dominant.

This collection of observations can be\nexplained by a relatively light dark matter particle with an annihilation cross\nsection consistent with that predicted for a simple thermal relic (sigma v ~\n10^-26 cm^3/s) and with a distribution in the halo of the Milky Way consistent\nwith that predicted from simulations. Astrophysical explanations for the gamma\nray and synchrotron signals, in contrast, have not been successful in\naccommodating these observations. Similarly, the phase of the annual modulation\nobserved by DAMA/LIBRA (and now supported by CoGeNT) is inconsistent with all\nknown or postulated modulating backgrounds, but are in good agreement with\nexpectations for dark matter scattering. This scenario is consistent with all\nexisting indirect and collider constraints, as well as the constraints placed\nby CDMS. Consistency with xenon-based experiments can be achieved if the\nresponse of liquid xenon to very low-energy nuclear recoils is somewhat\nsuppressed relative to previous evaluations, or if the dark matter possesses\ndifferent couplings to protons and neutrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 21:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-09"}

The criterion to enter the pair\ninstability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by the\nmass of the oxygen core. The main sequence masses that produce a given oxygen\ncore mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective and\nrotationally-induced mixing. We examine the evolution of massive stars to\ndetermine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instability\neffects, either a pulsational pair instability (PPISN) or a full-fledged\npair-instability supernova (PISN). We concentrate on zero-metallicity stars\nwith no mass loss subject to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective\ninstability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the Ledoux\ncriterion. As expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing,\nthe minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induce\neffectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is converted\nalmost entirely to helium and then to oxygen. For this case, we find that the\nminimum main sequence mass is ~40 Msun to encounter PPISN and ~65 Msun to\nencounter a PISN. When mass-loss is taken into account those mass limits become\n~50 Msun for PPISN and ~80 Msun for PISN progenitors. The implications of these\nresults for the first stars and for contemporary supernovae is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 00:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 01:22:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2012 23:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In a class of such\nmodels, like the generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model, baryons take the form of\ninstantons of the effective flavor gauge theory that resides on probe flavor\nbranes. In this paper we study the phase structure of baryonic crystals by\nanalyzing discrete periodic configurations of such instantons. We find that\ninstanton configurations exhibit a series of \"popcorn\" transitions upon\nincreasing the density. Through these transitions normal (3D) lattices expand\ninto the transverse dimension, eventually becoming a higher dimensional (4D)\nmulti-layer lattice at large densities.\n  We consider 3D lattices of zero size instantons as well as 1D periodic chains\nof finite size instantons, which serve as toy models of the full holographic\nsystems. In particular, for the finite-size case we determine solutions of the\ncorresponding ADHM equations for both a straight chain and for a 2D zigzag\nconfiguration where instantons pop up into the holographic dimension. At low\ndensity the system takes the form of an \"abelian anti-ferromagnetic\" straight\nperiodic chain. Above a critical density there is a second order phase\ntransition into a zigzag structure. An even higher density yields a rich phase\nspace characterized by the formation of multi-layer zigzag structures. The\nfinite size of the lattices in the transverse dimension is a signal of an\nemerging Fermi sea of quarks. We thus propose that the popcorn transitions\nindicate the onset of the \"quarkyonic\" phase of the cold dense nuclear matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 00:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2012 15:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this novel scenario a free-floating planet interacts with\nan already existing planetary system, created in a tight cluster, and is\ncaptured as a new planet. In the present work we study this interaction process\nby integrating trajectories of planet-sized bodies, which encounter a binary\nsystem consisting of a Jupiter-sized planet revolving around a Sun-like star.\nTo simplify the problem we assume coplanar orbits for the bound and the\nfree-floating planet and an initially parabolic orbit for the free-floating\nplanet. By calculating the uncertainty exponent, a quantity that measures the\ndependence of the final state of the system on small changes of the initial\nconditions, we show that the interaction process is a fractal classical\nscattering. The uncertainty exponent is in the range (0.2-0.3) and is a\ndecreasing function of time. In this way we see that the statistical approach\nwe follow to tackle the problem is justified. The possible final outcomes of\nthis interaction are only four, namely flyby, planet exchange, capture or\ndisruption. We give the probability of each outcome as a function of the\nincoming planet's mass. We find that the probability of exchange or capture (in\nprograde as well as retrograde orbits and for very long times) is\nnon-negligible, a fact that might explain the possible future observations of\nplanetary systems with orbits that are either retrograde or tight and highly\neccentric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 10:17:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 09:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 11:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Above the transition, mechanical and thermal properties are\nfound to depend on the number of particles per lattice site in the simulation\nbox, and the application of a recent methodology for multiple occupancy\ncrystals (B.M.

Within this scheme we have performed\nfree energy calculations at two reduced density {\\rho}/{\\rho}\\ast = 4,5 and for\nseveral cubic structures as FCC,BCC,A15. At both densities, the BCC symmetry is\nfound to correspond to the minimum of the unconstrained free energy, that is to\nthe stable symmetry among the few considered, while the A15 structure is almost\ndegenerate, indicating that the present sys- tem prefers to crystallize in less\npacked structures.

It is difficult due to\nits dependence on inverse kinematics (IK) techniques and articulate property of\nhuman characters . To solve the IK problem, classical methods that rely on\nnumerical solutions often suffer from the under-determination problem and can\nnot guarantee naturalness. Existing data-driven methods address this problem by\nlearning from motion capture data. When facing a large variety of poses\nhowever, these methods may not be able to capture the pose styles or be\napplicable in real-time environment. Inspired from the low-rank motion\nde-noising and completion model in \\cite{lai2011motion}, we propose a novel\nmodel for character posing based on sparse coding. Unlike conventional\napproaches, our model directly captures the pose styles in Euclidean space to\nprovide intuitive training error measurements and facilitate pose synthesis. A\npose dictionary is learned in training stage and based on it natural poses are\nsynthesized to satisfy users' constraints . We compare our model with existing\nmodels for tasks of pose de-noising and completion. Experiments show our model\nobtains lower de-noising and completion error. We also provide User\nInterface(UI) examples illustrating that our model is effective for interactive\ncharacter posing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 13:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Its mass is equal to the\ncritical mass below which cold clumps would be destroyed quickly by\nevaporation. Its mass is also constrained by the fact that at apocenter its\nsound crossing timescale was equal to its orbital timescale.

For some choice of parameters\nfermions propagate with the superluminal speed. Thus, the novel tachyonic\nequation is suggested. The relativistic 20-component first-order wave equation\nis formulated and projection operators extracting states with definite energy\nand spin projections are obtained. The Lagrangian formulation of the\nfirst-order equation is presented and the electric current and energy-momentum\ntensor are found. The minimal and non-minimal electromagnetic interactions of\nfermions are considered and Schr\\\"{o}dinger's form of the equation and the\nquantum-mechanical Hamiltonian are obtained. The canonical quantization of the\nfield in the first-order formalism is performed and we find the vacuum\nexpectation of chronological pairing of operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 17:00:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 18:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-11"}
