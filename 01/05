Typical approaches widely\nused in this context are the PNJL and chiral quark-meson models. It is pointed\nout, however, that the modeling of the phase diagram in terms of quarks as\nquasiparticles misses important and well known nuclear physics constraints. In\nthe hadronic phase of QCD governed by confinement and spontaneously broken\nchiral symmetry, in-medium chiral effective field theory is the appropriate\nframework, with pions and nucleons as active degrees of freedom. Nuclear chiral\nthermodynamics is outlined and the liquid-gas phase transition is described.\nThe density and temperature dependence of the chiral condensate is deduced. As\na consequence of two- and three-body correlations in the nuclear medium, no\ntendency towards a first-order chiral phase transition is found at least up to\ntwice the baryon density of normal nuclear matter and up to temperatures of\nabout 100 MeV. Isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter are also\ndiscussed. An outlook is given on new tightened constraints for the\nequation-of-state of cold and highly compressed matter as implied by a recently\nobserved two-solar-mass neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 18:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Mathematically, these modalities require that we\nreconstruct a diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ for $x\\in X$, a bounded domain\nin $\\Rm^n$, from knowledge of $\\sigma(x)|\\nabla u|^2(x)$ for $x\\in X$, where\n$u$ is the solution to the elliptic equation $-\\nabla\\cdot\\sigma\\nabla u=0$ in\n$X$ with $u=f$ on $\\partial X$.\n  This inverse problem may be recast as a nonlinear equation, which formally\ntakes the form of a 0-Laplacian. Whereas $p-$Laplacians with $p>1$ are\nwell-studied variational elliptic non-linear equations, $p=1$ is a limiting\ncase with a convex but not strictly convex functional, and the case $p<1$\nadmits a variational formulation with a functional that is not convex.

Examples include the\nverification of quantitative properties of software involving constraints on\ntiming and energy consumption, and the automatic synthesis of systems from\nspecifications. The major challenges include environment modeling,\nincompleteness in specifications, and the complexity of underlying decision\nproblems.\n  This position paper proposes sciduction, an approach to tackle these\nchallenges by integrating inductive inference, deductive reasoning, and\nstructure hypotheses. Deductive reasoning, which leads from general rules or\nconcepts to conclusions about specific problem instances, includes techniques\nsuch as logical inference and constraint solving. Inductive inference, which\ngeneralizes from specific instances to yield a concept, includes algorithmic\nlearning from examples. Structure hypotheses are used to define the class of\nartifacts, such as invariants or program fragments, generated during\nverification or synthesis. Sciduction constrains inductive and deductive\nreasoning using structure hypotheses, and actively combines inductive and\ndeductive reasoning: for instance, deductive techniques generate examples for\nlearning, and inductive reasoning is used to guide the deductive engines.\n  We illustrate this approach with three applications: (i) timing analysis of\nsoftware; (ii) synthesis of loop-free programs, and (iii) controller synthesis\nfor hybrid systems. Some future applications are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 19:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The sample\nconsists of 16 massive clusters detected with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope\n(ACT) over a 455 sq. deg. area of the southern sky. Deep multi-object\nspectroscopic observations were taken to secure intermediate-resolution\n(R~700-800) spectra and redshifts for ~60 member galaxies on average per\ncluster. The dynamical masses M_200c of the clusters have been calculated using\nsimulation-based scaling relations between velocity dispersion and mass. The\nsample has a median redshift z=0.50 and a median mass M_200c~12e14 Msun/h70\nwith a lower limit M_200c~6e14 Msun/h70, consistent with the expectations for\nthe ACT southern sky survey. These masses are compared to the ACT SZE\nproperties of the sample, specifically, the match-filtered central SZE\namplitude y, the central Compton parameter y0, and the integrated Compton\nsignal Y_200c, which we use to derive SZE-Mass scaling relations. All SZE\nestimators correlate with dynamical mass with low intrinsic scatter (<~20%), in\nagreement with numerical simulations. We explore the effects of various\nsystematic effects on these scaling relations, including the correlation\nbetween observables and the influence of dynamically disturbed clusters. Using\nthe 3-dimensional information available, we divide the sample into relaxed and\ndisturbed clusters and find that ~50% of the clusters are disturbed. There are\nhints that disturbed systems might bias the scaling relations but given the\ncurrent sample sizes these differences are not significant; further studies\nincluding more clusters are required to assess the impact of these clusters on\nthe scaling relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 20:57:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 00:11:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 19:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

An extended DM annihilation profile dominated by emission from\nsubstructures is preferred over a simple point source model. The significance\nof DM detection is 4.4 sigma in Virgo and lower in the other two clusters. We\nalso consider the possibility that the excess emission arises from cosmic ray\n(CR) induced gamma-rays, and infer a CR level within a factor of three of that\nexpected from analytical models. However, the significance of a CR component is\nlower than the significance of a DM component, and there is no need for such a\nCR component in the presence of a DM component in the preferred DM mass range.\nWe also set flux and cross-section upper limits for DM annihilation into the\nb-bbar and mu-mu channels in all three clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 21:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 02:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Now, a\ndedicated Gd test facility is operating in the Kamioka Mine. This new facility\nhouses everything needed to successfully operate a Gd doped water Cherenkov\ndetector. Successful running of this facility will demonstrate that adding Gd\nsalt to SK is both safe for the detector and is capable of delivering the\nexpected physics benefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 21:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-03"}

The precise timing of initiation of DNA replication is determined by a\nregulatory circuit that depends on the binding of a critical number of\nATP-bound DnaA proteins at the origin of replication. The synthesis of DnaA in\nthe cell is controlled by a growth-rate dependent, negatively autoregulated\ngene found near the origin of replication. Both the regulatory and initiation\nactivity of DnaA depend on its nucleotide bound state and its availability.\n  Results: In order to investigate the contributions of the different\nregulatory processes to the timing of initiation of DNA replication at varying\ngrowth rates, we formulate a minimal quantitative model of the initiator\ncircuit that includes the key ingredients known to regulate the activity of the\nDnaA protein. This model describes the average-cell oscillations in\nDnaA-ATP/DNA during the cell cycle, for varying growth rates. We evaluate the\nconditions under which this ratio attains the same threshold value at the time\nof initiation, independently of the growth rate.\n  Conclusions: We find that a quantitative description of replication\ninitiation by DnaA must rely on the dependency of the basic parameters on\ngrowth rate, in order to account for the timing of initiation of DNA\nreplication at different cell doubling times. We isolate two main possible\nscenarios for this. One possibility is that the basal rate of regulatory\ninactivation by ATP hydrolysis must vary with growth rate. Alternatively, some\nparameters defining promoter activity need to be a function of the growth rate.\nIn either case, the basal rate of gene expression needs to increase with the\ngrowth rate, in accordance with the known characteristics of the dnaA promoter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 22:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The\nV-H colors show marginal evidence for bimodality, consistent with bimodality in\nV-I and unimodality in I-H. If bimodality is imposed for I-H with a double\nGaussian model, the preferred blue/red split differs from that for optical\ncolors; these \"differing bimodalities\" mean that the optical and optical-IR\ncolors cannot both be linearly proportional to metallicity.

We report here a novel method for the fast, single-step epitaxial\ngrowth of large-area homogeneous graphene film on the surface of SiC(0001)\nusing an infrared CO2 laser (10.6 {\\mu}m) as the heating source. Apart from\nenabling extreme heating and cooling rates, which can control the stacking\norder of epitaxial graphene, this method is cost-effective in that it does not\nnecessitate SiC pre-treatment and/or high vacuum, it operates at low\ntemperature and proceeds in the second time scale, thus providing a green\nsolution to EG fabrication and a means to engineering graphene patterns on SiC\nby focused laser beams. Uniform, low-strain graphene film is demonstrated by\nscanning electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron, secondary ion mass, and\nRaman spectroscopies. Scalability to industrial level of the method described\nhere appears to be realistic, in view of the high rate of CO2-laser induced\ngraphene growth and the lack of strict sample-environment conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 23:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-06"}

This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet\npopulation synthesis calculations.\n  Aims. Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of\nimportant disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass and lifetime on\nfundamental planetary properties.\n  Methods. For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population\nof planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration\nand disk evolution.\n  Results. We find a large number of correlations: Regarding the planetary\ninitial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have different\nroles: For high [Fe/H], giant planets are more frequent. For high disk masses,\ngiant planets are more massive. For long disk lifetimes, giant planets are both\nmore frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets\ncannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.\nIn contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The sweet spot\nfor giant planet formation is at 5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher\nplanetesimals surface densities are necessary. Low metallicities can be\ncompensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low\nmetallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at high\nmetallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. The extent of\nmigration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases with\nmetallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis of\ngiant planets exists because in low [Fe/H] disks, planets start further out,\nbut migrate more, whereas for high [Fe/H] they start further in, but migrate\nless. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than Hot\nJupiters.\n  Conclusions. The properties of protoplanetary disks are decisive for the\nproperties of planets, and leave many imprints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 23:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Unusually deep,\nhigh signal-to-noise images of M87 are used to measure the effective and\nlimiting radii of approximately 2000 globular clusters. To compare with these\nobservations, we simulate a globular cluster population that has the same\ncharacteristics as the observed M87 cluster population.

We reconstruct the spectral energy distribution in the soft\nX-ray to gamma-ray domain in order to provide a better understanding of the\nprocesses in the AGN.

The\nsecond model describes the high-energy spectrum by two independent components:\na thermal inverse Compton process of photons in the non-beamed AGN and a\nnon-thermal emission of the gamma-rays. These components are represented by an\nabsorbed cut-off power law for the thermal component in the X-ray energy range\nand a simple power law for the non-thermal component in the gamma-rays. For the\nthermal process, we obtain a photon index of Gamma=1.6, a cut-off energy of Ec\n~ 150 keV and a hydrogen column density of NH = 6e24 1/cm**2.

We present an experimental\nstudy into the parameters, including the pulse energy, focal spot quality and\npulse power, that determine whether or not a wakefield accelerator will\nself-inject. By taking into account the processes of self-focusing and pulse\ncompression we are able to extend a previously described theoretical model,\nwhere the minimum bubble size required for trapping is not constant but varies\nslowly with density and find excellent agreement with this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 12:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

As active probing of all pairwise distances is infeasible in\nlarge-scale networks, a natural idea is to measure a few pairs and to predict\nthe other ones without actually measuring them. This paper formulates the\ndistance prediction problem as matrix completion where unknown entries of an\nincomplete matrix of pairwise distances are to be predicted. The problem is\nsolvable because strong correlations among network distances exist and cause\nthe constructed distance matrix to be low rank. The new formulation circumvents\nthe well-known drawbacks of existing approaches based on Euclidean embedding.\n  A new algorithm, so-called Decentralized Matrix Factorization by Stochastic\nGradient Descent (DMFSGD), is proposed to solve the network distance prediction\nproblem. By letting network nodes exchange messages with each other, the\nalgorithm is fully decentralized and only requires each node to collect and to\nprocess local measurements, with neither explicit matrix constructions nor\nspecial nodes such as landmarks and central servers. In addition, we compared\ncomprehensively matrix factorization and Euclidean embedding to demonstrate the\nsuitability of the former on network distance prediction.

In such\nsystems, users arrive at a station, take a bike and use it for a while, then\nreturn it to another station of their choice. Each station has a finite\ncapacity: it cannot host more bikes than its capacity. We propose a stochastic\nmodel of an homogeneous bike-sharing system and study the effect of users\nrandom choices on the number of problematic stations, i.e., stations that, at a\ngiven time, have no bikes available or no available spots for bikes to be\nreturned to. We quantify the influence of the station capacities, and we\ncompute the fleet size that is optimal in terms of minimizing the proportion of\nproblematic stations. Even in a homogeneous city, the system exhibits a poor\nperformance: the minimal proportion of problematic stations is of the order of\n(but not lower than) the inverse of the capacity. We show that simple\nincentives, such as suggesting users to return to the least loaded station\namong two stations, improve the situation by an exponential factor. We also\ncompute the rate at which bikes have to be redistributed by trucks to insure a\ngiven quality of service. This rate is of the order of the inverse of the\nstation capacity. For all cases considered, the fleet size that corresponds to\nthe best performance is half of the total number of spots plus a few more, the\nvalue of the few more can be computed in closed-form as a function of the\nsystem parameters.

By tuning the level of coarse graining,\ni.e. the number of monomers to be mapped onto a single blob, the model should\nbe adequate to explore the semidilute regime above the collapse transition,\nsince in this case the monomer density is very small if chains are long enough.\nThe implementation of these ideas has been previously based on a\ntransferability hypothesis, which was not completely tested against\nfull-monomer results (Pierleoni et al., J.

This\n250-km-thick layer has been interpreted as a stably stratified region of\nreduced composition in light elements(13).

The dynamical model we propose\nintroduces a clear asymmetry between a melting and a crystallizing hemisphere\nwhich forms a basis for also explaining the East-West asymmetry.

Within the suggested\napproach, wormholes are specified by a typical microscopic radius of their\nmouths, and this causes the size effect in operation of wormhole-based time\nmachines (closed timelike curves; CTCs). For geometric reasons, classical solid\nballs in a spacetime with a wormhole are divided into the two categories: small\nand large balls whose traverse through wormholes is permitted and forbidden,\nrespectively. Evolutions of small balls on CTCs can be self-inconsistent (or,\nin other terms, inconsistent with conventional causality), in which case there\nis an uncertainty in their behaviors. In contrast, evolutions of large solid\nballs are always unambiguous. In the situation where small balls can be\nabsorbed by large balls, uncertain behaviors of small balls transform into\nunambiguous evolutions of large balls in the logical way analogous to that of a\nquantum measurement - wave function reduction - event.
