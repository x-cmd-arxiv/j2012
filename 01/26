At\nlowest order, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the conventional semi-classical\nformalism is replaced by an inverted-potential-vanishing-energy variant\nthereof. Under smoothness, convexity and coercivity hypotheses on its potential\nenergy function, we prove, using the calculus of variations together with the\nBanach space implicit function theorem, the existence of a global, smooth\n`fundamental solution'. Higher order quantum corrections, for ground and\nexcited states, are computed through the integration of associated systems of\nlinear transport equations, and formal expansions for the corresponding energy\neigenvalues obtained by imposing smoothness on the quantum corrections to the\neigenfunctions. For linear oscillators our expansions naturally truncate,\nreproducing the well-known solutions for the energy eigenfunctions and\neigenvalues. As an application, we calculate a number of terms in the\ncorresponding expansions for the one-dimensional anharmonic oscillators of\nquartic, sectic, octic, and dectic types and find that our eigenvalue\nexpansions agree with those of Rayleigh/Schrodinger theory, whereas our wave\nfunctions more accurately capture the more-rapid-than-gaussian decay. For the\nquartic oscillator our results strongly suggest that the ground state energy\neigenvalue expansion and its associated wave function expansion are Borel\nsummable to yield natural candidates for the actual exact ground state solution\nand its energy. Our techniques for proving the existence of the crucial\n`fundamental solution' to the relevant Hamilton Jacobi equation admit infinite\ndimensional generalizations. In a parallel project we shall show how this\nconstruction can be carried out for the Yang-Mills equations in Minkowski\nspacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 16:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In contrast to some previous efforts that implicitly\nencode Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints by modifying the graph Laplacian\nor constraining the underlying eigenspace, we present a more natural and\nprincipled formulation, which explicitly encodes the constraints as part of a\nconstrained optimization problem. Our method offers several practical\nadvantages: it can encode the degree of belief in Must-Link and Cannot-Link\nconstraints; it guarantees to lower-bound how well the given constraints are\nsatisfied using a user-specified threshold; it can be solved deterministically\nin polynomial time through generalized eigendecomposition. Furthermore, by\ninheriting the objective function from spectral clustering and encoding the\nconstraints explicitly, much of the existing analysis of unconstrained spectral\nclustering techniques remains valid for our formulation. We validate the\neffectiveness of our approach by empirical results on both artificial and real\ndatasets.

The wave penetration (with\na typical wavelength of the order of 10 km) of the generated ELF currents and\nfields into the deeper ionospheric layers up to 120 km takes place due to the\ndominance of the Hall conductivity over the Pederson conductivity in the region\nbetween 90-120 km and penetration becomes diffusive above 120 km.

The existence of a\nmanifestly dual gauge-theory amplitude trivializes the construction of the\ncorresponding N=8 supergravity integrand, whose graph numerators are double\ncopies (squares) of the N=4 super-Yang-Mills numerators. The success of this\nprocedure provides further nontrivial evidence that the duality and double-copy\nproperties hold at loop level.

Since the quadrupole moment generated by gravitational waves (GWs)\ngives rise to a different polarization pattern than that produced by scalar\nmodes, one can put interesting constraints on the strength of GWs on large\nscales by cross-correlating the small scale galaxy distribution and CMB\npolarization.

Non-equilibrium He3 burning creates a\nconvective core, which is separated from a deep convective envelope by a small\nradiative zone. The steady increase in central He3 causes the core to grow\nuntil it touches the surface convection zone, which triggers fully convective\nepisodes in what we call the \"convective kissing instability\". These episodes\nlower the central abundance and cause the star to return to a state in which is\nhas a separate convective core and envelope. These periodic events eventually\ncease when the He3 abundance throughout the star is sufficiently high that the\nstar is fully convective, and remains so for the rest of its main sequence\nlifetime.

Remarkably, we find a clear peak in the typical Eddington\nratio at black hole masses of 4-8 * 10^7 solar masses (typically found in halos\nof ~7 * 10^11 to 10^12 solar masses), independent of redshift and indicative\nthat most of BH growth occurs in the cold-flow dominated regime. Black hole\ngrowth is by and large regulated by the evolution of gas density. The typical\nEddington ratio at a given mass scales simply as cosmological density (1+z)^3\nand the peak is caused by the competition between increased gas density\navailable in more massive hosts, and a decrease due to strong AGN feedback that\ndeprives the black hole of sufficient gas to fuel further rapid growth in the\nhigh mass end.

We take into account the energy and angle-dependence of\nthe conversion probability and the surface thermal emission from NSs. The\nlatter is computed from magnetized atmosphere models that include the effect of\nphoton polarization mode conversion due to vacuum polarization. The resulting\nspectral models, inclusive of the general-relativistic effects of gravitational\nredshift and light deflection, allow us to make realistic predictions for the\neffects of photon to axion conversion on observed NS spectra, light curves, and\npolarization signals. We identify unique signatures of the conversion, such as\nan increase of the effective area of a hot spot as it rotates away from the\nobserver line of sight. For a star emitting from the entire surface, the\nconversion produces apparent radii that are either larger or smaller (depending\non axion mass and coupling strength) than the limits set by NS equations of\nstate. For an emission region that is observed phase-on, photon-axion\nconversion results in an inversion of the plane of polarization with respect to\nthe no-conversion case. While the quantitative details of the features that we\nidentify depend on NS properties (magnetic field strength, temperature) and\naxion parameters, the spectral and polarization signatures induced by\nphoton-axion conversion are distinctive enough to make NSs very interesting and\npromising probes of axion physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 21:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-29"}

In the following, we will present evidence that accretion rate\nis also a key parameter for the presence of Hidden Broad Line Regions in\nSeyfert 2 galaxies. Our sample consists of 21 sources with polarized Hidden\nBroad Lines and 18 sources without Hidden Broad Lines. We use stellar velocity\ndispersions from several studies on the CaII and Mg b triplets in Seyfert 2\ngalaxies, to estimate the mass of the central black holes via the\nMbh-{\\sigma}\\ast relation. The ratio between the bolometric luminosity, derived\nfrom the intrinsic (i.e. unabsorbed) X-ray luminosity, and the Eddington\nluminosity is a measure of the rate at which matter accretes onto the central\nsupermassive black hole. A separation between Compton-thin HBLR and non-HBLR\nsources is clear, both in accretion rate (log Lbol/LEdd = -1.9) and in\nluminosity (log Lbol = 43.90). When, properly luminosity-corrected,\nCompton-thick sources are included, the separation between HBLR and non-HBLR is\nless sharp but no HBLR source falls below the Eddington ratio threshold. We\nspeculate that non-HBLR Compton-thick sources with accretion rate higher than\nthe threshold, do possess a BLR, but something, probably related to their heavy\nabsorption, is preventing us from observing it even in polarized light. Our\nresults for Compton-thin sources support theoretical expectations. In a model\npresented by Nicastro (2000), the presence of broad emission lines is\nintrinsically connected with disk instabilities occuring in proximity of a\ntransition radius, which is a function of the accretion rate, becoming smaller\nthan the innermost stable orbit for very low accretion rates and therefore\nluminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 21:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In\ngeneral, the power-law rise can differ from quadratic depending on the details\nof the event, so comparisons of this work with observed bolometric rises of SNe\nIa would place strong constraints on the distribution of shallow radioactive\nmaterial, providing important clues for identifying the elusive progenitors of\nSNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 21:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Ideally, these\nstudies can identify limitations in sound processing strategies and lead to\nimproved methods for providing sound information to cochlear implant users. To\naccomplish this, models must accurately describe auditory nerve spiking while\navoiding excessive complexity that would preclude large-scale simulations of\npopulations of auditory nerve fibers and obscure insight into the mechanisms\nthat influence neural encoding of sound information. In this spirit, we develop\na point process model of the auditory nerve that provides a compact and\naccurate description of neural responses to electric stimulation. Inspired by\nthe framework of generalized linear models, the proposed model consists of a\ncascade of linear and nonlinear stages. We show how each of these stages can be\nassociated with biophysical mechanisms and related to models of neuronal\ndynamics. Moreover, we derive a semi-analytical procedure that uniquely\ndetermines each parameter in the model on the basis of fundamental statistics\nfrom recordings of single fiber responses to electric stimulation, including\nthreshold, relative spread, jitter, and chronaxie.

Both equations require field evaluation of\nconstrained (divergence free) vector valued quantities (velocity, vorticity)\nand cross terms from these. These are usually evaluated by performing several\nFMM accelerated sums of scalar harmonic functions.\n  We present a formulation of the vortex methods based on the Lamb-Helmholtz\ndecomposition of the velocity in terms of two scalar potentials. In its\noriginal form, this decomposition is not invariant with respect to translation,\nviolating a key requirement for the FMM. One of the key contributions of this\npaper is a theory for translation for this representation. The translation\ntheory is developed by introducing \"conversion\" operators, which enable the\nrepresentation to be restored in an arbitrary reference frame.

However, for extremely\nlarge price changes, the trade size and news play a minor role, while the\nliquidity (especially price gaps on the limit order book) is a more influencing\nfactor. Hence, there might be other influencing factors of immediate price\nimpacts of trades. In this paper, through mechanical analysis of price\nvariations before and after a trade of arbitrary size, we identify that the\ntrade size, the bid-ask spread, the price gaps and the outstanding volumes at\nthe bid and ask sides of the limit order book have impacts on the changes of\nprices. We propose two regression models to investigate the influences of these\nmicroscopic factors on the price impact of buyer-initiated partially filled\ntrades, seller-initiated partially filled trades, buyer-initiated filled\ntrades, and seller-initiated filled trades. We find that they have\nquantitatively similar explanation powers and these factors can account for up\nto 44% of the price impacts. Large trade sizes, wide bid-ask spreads, high\nliquidity at the same side and low liquidity at the opposite side will cause a\nlarge price impact. We also find that the liquidity at the opposite side has a\nmore influencing impact than the liquidity at the same side. Our results shed\nnew lights on the determinants of immediate price impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 08:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-27"}

The HIFI instrument onboard Herschel has allowed high spectral\nresolution and sensitive observations of ground-state transi- tions of three\nmolecular ions: the methylidyne cation CH+, its isotopologue 13CH+, and\nsulfanylium SH+. Because of their unique chemical properties, a comparative\nanalysis of these cations provides essential clues to the link between the\nchemistry and dynamics of the diffuse interstellar medium. Methods. The CH+,\n13CH+, and SH+ lines are observed in absorption towards the distant high-mass\nstar-forming regions (SFRs) DR21(OH), G34.3+0.1, W31C, W33A, W49N, and W51, and\ntowards two sources close to the Galactic centre, SgrB2(N) and SgrA*+50. All\nsight lines sample the diffuse interstellar matter along pathlengths of several\nkiloparsecs across the Galactic Plane. In order to compare the velocity\nstructure of each species, the observed line profiles were deconvolved from the\nhyperfine structure of the SH+ transition and the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ spectra\nwere independently decomposed into Gaussian velocity components. To analyse the\nchemical composition of the foreground gas, all spectra were divided, in a\nsecond step, into velocity intervals over which the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ column\ndensities and abundances were derived. Results. SH+ is detected along all\nobserved lines of sight, with a velocity structure close to that of CH+ and\n13CH+. The linewidth distributions of the CH+, SH+, and 13CH+ Gaussian\ncomponents are found to be similar. These distributions have the same mean\n(<\\delta\\u{psion}> ~ 4.2 km s-1) and standard deviation\n(\\sigma(\\delta\\u{psion}) ~ 1.5 km s-1). This mean value is also close to that\nof the linewidth distribution of the CH+ visible transitions detected in the\nsolar neighbourhood. We show that the lack of absorption components narrower\nthan 2 km s-1 is not an artefact caused by noise: the CH+, 13CH+, and SH+ line\nprofiles are therefore statistically broader than those of most species\ndetected in absorption in diffuse interstellar gas (e. g. HCO+, CH, or CN). The\nSH+/CH+ column density ratio observed in the components located away from the\nGalactic centre spans two orders of magnitude and correlates with the CH+\nabundance. Conversely, the ratio observed in the components close to the\nGalactic centre varies over less than one order of magnitude with no apparent\ncorrelation with the CH+ abundance. The observed dynamical and chemical\nproperties of SH+ and CH+ are proposed to trace the ubiquitous process of\nturbulent dissipation, in shocks or shears, in the diffuse ISM and the specific\nenvironment of the Galactic centre regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 08:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Specifically, we start by\nproposing the theoretical notion of Abstract Negotiation Method (ANM) as a map\nfrom the negotiation domain in itself, for any utility profile of the parties.\nANM can face both direct and iterative negotiations, since we show that ANM\nclass is closed under the limit operation. The generality of ANM is proven by\nshowing that it captures a large class of well known in literature negotiation\nmethods. Hence we show that if mutual information is assumed then any Pareto\nefficient ANM is manipulable by one single party or by a collusion of few of\nthem. We concern about the efficiency of the resulting manipulation. Thus we\nfind necessarily and sufficient conditions those make manipulability equivalent\nto actual inefficiency, meaning that the manipulation implies a change of the\nefficient frontier so the Pareto efficient ANM converges to a different, hence\nactually inefficient, frontier. In particular we distinguish between strong and\nweak actual inefficiency. Where, the strong actual inefficiency is a drawback\nwhich is not possible to overcome of the ANMs, like the Pareto invariant one,\nso its negotiation result is invariant for any two profiles of utility sharing\nthe same Pareto frontier, we present. While the weak actual inefficiency is a\ndrawback of any mathematical theorization on rational agents which constrain in\na particular way their space of utility functions. For the weak actual\ninefficiency we state a principle of Result's Inconsistency by showing that to\nfalsify theoretical hypotheses is rational for any agent which is informed\nabout the preference of the other, even if the theoretical assumptions, which\nconstrain the space of agents' utilities, are exact in the reality, i.e. the\npreferences of each single agent are well modeled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 10:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 17:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-19"}

Limits on the\nparameter space from experimental and cosmological observations relating to the\ninert neutralino dark matter are explored and the consequences for Higgs boson\nphenomenology are investigated. In plausible scenarios it is found that the\ncouplings of the lightest inert neutralinos to the SM-like Higgs boson are\nalways rather large. This has major implications for Higgs boson collider\nphenomenology and leads to large spin-independent LSP-nucleon cross-sections.\nBecause of the latter, scenarios in which $E_6$SSM inert neutralinos account\nfor all of the observed dark matter are now severely challenged by recent dark\nmatter direct detection experiment analyses. In plausible scenarios consistent\nwith observations from both cosmology and LEP the lightest inert neutralino is\nrequired to have a mass around half of the Z boson mass if it contributes to\ncold dark matter and this means that $\\tan(\\beta)$ cannot be too large.\n  A new variant of the $E_6$SSM called the $E_6Z_2^S$SSM is also presented in\nwhich the dark matter scenario is very different to the inert neutralino cold\ndark matter scenario and in which the presence of supersymmetric massless\nstates in the early universe modifies the expansion rate of the universe prior\nto Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The new dark matter scenario is consistent with\ncurrent observations and the modified expansion rate provides a better\nexplanation of various data than the SM prediction. The prospects for a warm\ndark matter scenario in the $E_6$SSM are also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 11:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-27"}

Interestingly, in spite of the difference in shape\nbetween the galaxy and dark matter radial distributions, both exhibit a high\ndegree of self-similarity. A self-consistent comparison to several recent\nsemi-analytic models of galaxy formation indicates that: (1) beyond ~0.3 r_500\ncurrent models are able to reproduce both the shape and normalisation of the\nsatellite profiles; and (2) within ~0.3 r_500 the predicted profiles are\nsensitive to the details of the satellite-BCG merger timescale calculation. The\nformer is a direct result of the models being tuned to match the global galaxy\nluminosity function combined with the assumption that the satellite galaxies do\nnot suffer significant tidal stripping, even though their surrounding dark\nmatter haloes can be removed through this process. Combining our results with\nmeasurements of the intracluster light should provide a way to inform\ntheoretical models on the efficacy of the tidal stripping and merging\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 11:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Although the\nnumerically illustrated results from dataset revealed that PCA has explained\nmost of the cumulative variance of data but in reality when the very large\ndimensional cell formation problem based on sequence is available then to\nobtain the clustering structure from PCA projection is become very difficult.\nMost importantly, in the visual clustering of ordinal data, the use of U-matrix\nalone can not be efficient to get the cluster structure but with color\nextraction, hit map, labeling via the SOM node map it becomes a powerful\nclustering visualization methodology and thus the present research contribute\nsignificantly in the research of cellular manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 14:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-21"}

The method inherits size-consistency\nand extensivity from the CC method. The method is dubbed orbital-adaptive\ntime-dependent coupled-cluster (OATDCC), and is a hierarchy of approximations\nto the now standard multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for\nfermions. A numerical experiment is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 15:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 10:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In particular, anisotropic gate potentials\nenhance the phonon mediated spin-flip rate and reduce the cusp-like structure\nto lower magnetic fields, in addition to the lower QDs radii in III-V\nsemiconductor QDs. In InAs QDs, only the Rashba spin-orbit coupling contributes\nto the phonon induced spin relaxation rate. However, for GaAs QDs, the Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling has a contribution near the accidental degeneracy point and\nthe Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling has a contribution below and above the\naccidental degeneracy point in the manipulation of phonon induced spin\nrelaxation rates in QDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 15:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-27"}
