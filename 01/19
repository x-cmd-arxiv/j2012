The loss of spherical symmetry occurs\nsomewhere between the AGB and PN phase. The cause of this change of morphology\nis not yet well known, but magnetic fields are one of the possible agents. Its\norigin remains to be determined, and potentially requires the presence of a\nmassive companion to the AGB star. Therefore, further detections of the\nmagnetic field around evolved stars (in particular those thought to be part of\na binary system) are crucial to improve our understanding of the origin and\nrole of magnetism on evolved stars. One such binaries is the pre-PN OH231.8,\naround which a magnetic field was detected in the OH maser region of the outer\ncircumstellar envelope. We aim to detect and infer the properties of the\nmagnetic field of this source in the water maser region.\n  We observed the 6_{1,6}-5_{2,3} water maser rotational transition to\ndetermine its linear and circular polarization. These emissions are located\nwithin the inner regions of OH231.8 (at few tens of AU). We detected 30 water\nmaser features, which occur in two distinct regions that are moving apart with\na velocity on the sky of 2.3 mas/year. Taking into account the inclination\nangle of the source, this corresponds to an average separation velocity of 21\nkm/s. Based on the velocity gradient of the maser emission, the masers appear\nto be dragged along the direction of the nebula jet. Linear polarization is\npresent in 3 of the features, and circular polarization was detected in the 2\nbrightest ones. We found that the strength of the magnetic field is |B_{||}|~45\nmG which, when assuming a toroidal magnetic field, implies B~2.5 G on the\nstellar surface. The morphology of the field is not yet determined, but the\nhigh scatter found on the directions of the linear polarization vectors could\nindicate that the masers occur near the tangent points of a toroidal field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2012 16:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 13:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

A general modelling technique is thus worth\nstudying to understand model combination deeply and shed light on creating new\nmodels. Prediction markets show a promise of becoming such a generic, flexible\ncombinatorial model. By reviewing on several popular combinatorial models and\nprediction market models, this paper aims to show how the market models can\ngeneralise different combinatorial stuctures and how they implement these\npopular combinatorial models in specific conditions. Besides, we will see among\ndifferent market models, Storkey's \\emph{Machine Learning Markets} provide more\nfundamental, generic modelling mechanisms than the others, and it has a\nsignificant appeal for both theoretical study and application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2012 17:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-19"}

As noted by several authors, the post-break decay\nslope seen in the UVOT data is much shallower than the steep decay in the X-ray\nband, pointing to an excess of optical flux at late times.

We prove a global dispersion\nresult that can be expressed in terms of this entropy dispersion matrix and\nprovides intuition on the approximate rate losses at a given blocklength and\nerror probability. To gain better intuition about the rate at which the\nnon-asymptotic rate region converges to the Slepian-Wolf boundary, we define\nand characterize two operational dispersions: the local dispersion and the\nweighted sum-rate dispersion. The former represents the rate of convergence to\na point on the Slepian-Wolf boundary while the latter represents the fastest\nrate for which a weighted sum of the two rates converges to its asymptotic\nfundamental limit.

With disorder and strongly\nlocalized fermions, we have compared our results to a model with a dynamical\nexponent $z \\ne 1$, and also a model for entanglement entropy based upon\ndynamical scaling at the Infinite Disorder Fixed Point (IDFP).

Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO)\nallows the analyst to minimize some cost function while ensuring some minimal\nperformances cast as admissible probabilities of failure for a set of\nperformance functions. In order to address real-world problems in which the\nperformance is assessed through computational models (e.g. large scale finite\nelement models) meta-modelling techniques have been developed in the past\ndecade. This paper introduces adaptive kriging surrogate models to solve the\nRBDO problem. The latter is cast in an augmented space that \"sums up\" the range\nof the design space and the aleatory uncertainty in the design parameters and\nthe environmental conditions. Thus the surrogate model is used (i) for\nevaluating robust estimates of the probabilities of failure (and for enhancing\nthe computational experimental design by adaptive sampling) in order to achieve\nthe requested accuracy and (ii) for applying the gradient-based optimization\nalgorithm. The approach is applied to the optimal design of imperfect stiffened\ncylinder shells used in submarine engineering. For this application the\nperformance of the structure is related to buckling which is addressed here by\nmeans of the asymptotic numerical method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2012 21:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 16:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

In the 1970-ies it has been recognized that the\ndifferential magnitude distribution of old globular clusters is very similar in\ndifferent galaxies presenting a peak at M_V ~ -7.5. This peak magnitude of the\nso-called Globular Cluster Luminosity Function has been then established as a\nsecondary distance indicator. The intrinsic accuracy of the method has been\nestimated to be of the order of ~0.2 mag, competitive with other distance\ndetermination methods. Lately the study of the Globular Cluster Systems has\nbeen used more as a tool for galaxy formation and evolution, and less so for\ndistance determinations. Nevertheless, the collection of homogeneous and large\ndatasets with the ACS on board HST presented new insights on the usefulness of\nthe Globular Cluster Luminosity Function as distance indicator. I discuss here\nrecent results based on observational and theoretical studies, which show that\nthis distance indicator depends on complex physics of the cluster formation and\ndynamical evolution, and thus can have dependencies on Hubble type, environment\nand dynamical history of the host galaxy.

To this end, we approximate\nthe negative log density (i.e., the energy function) of the distribution of\ninterest by a quadratic function U0 for which Hamiltonian dynamics can be\nsolved analytically. The overall energy function U is then written as U0 + U1,\nwhere U1 is the approximation error.

In combination with stellar mass\nestimates of late-type GOODS SN hosts from Thomson & Chary (2011), we\ninvestigate the correlation of host mass with Hubble residual observed at lower\nredshifts. Although the sample is small and the uncertainties are large, a hint\nof this relation is found at z>0.9. By simultaneously fitting the average\ncluster galaxy formation history and dust content to the red-sequence scatters,\nwe show that the reddening of early-type cluster SN hosts is likely E(B-V) <~\n0.06. The similarity of the field and cluster early-type host samples suggests\nthat field early-type galaxies that lie on the red sequence may also be\nminimally affected by dust. Hence, the early-type hosted SNe Ia studied here\noccupy a more favorable environment to use as well-characterized high-redshift\nstandard candles than other SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 08:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

A gene family includes instances of the same gene in\ndifferent species (orthologs) and duplicate genes in the same species\n(paralogs). Genes are gained and lost during evolution. With advances in\nsequencing technology, researchers are able to investigate the important roles\nof gene duplications and losses in adaptive evolution. Because of gene complex\nevolution, ortholog identification is a basic but difficult task in comparative\ngenomics. A key method for the task is to use an explicit model of the\nevolutionary history of the genes being studied, called the gene (family) tree.\nIt compares the gene tree with the evolutionary history of the species in which\nthe genes reside, called the species tree, using the procedure known as tree\nreconciliation. Reconciling binary gene and specific trees is simple. However,\nboth gene and species trees may be non-binary in practice and thus tree\nreconciliation presents challenging problems. Here, non-binary gene and species\ntree reconciliation is studied in a binary refinement model.\n  Results: The problem of reconciling arbitrary gene and species trees is\nproved NP-hard even for the duplication cost. We then present the first\nefficient method for reconciling a non-binary gene tree and a non-binary\nspecies tree. It attempts to find binary refinements of the given gene and\nspecies trees that minimize reconciliation cost.

These phenomena bring the star to\nevolve in the quite different (opposite) ways and should be taken into account\nat once, as the gravitational compression is considered. Under the above\ntransition, which is expected to occur within any supermassive neutron star\n(NS), the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum - a coherent state of gluon- and chiral\n$q\\bar q$-condensates - turns, first near the star center, into the \"empty\"\n(perturbation) subhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, pre-existing (very high)\nvacuum pressure falls there down rather abruptly; as a result, the \"cold\" star\nstarts collapsing almost freely into the new vacuum. If the stellar mass is\nsufficiently large, then this implosion is shown to result in an enormous\nheating within the star central domain (up to a temperature about 100-200 MeV\nor, maybe, even higher), what makes the pressure from within to grow up,\npredominantly due to degeneracy breaking and multiple $q\\bar q$-pair\nproduction. Thus, a \"flaming wall\" could arise, which withstands the further\ncollapsing and brings the star off the irrevocable shutting into BH.

We present a simple system of indices to\ncharacterize the young candidates and help prioritize follow up observations.\nNew group members identified in this candidate list will be high priority\ntargets for: 1) exoplanet direct imaging searches, 2) the study of post-T-Tauri\nastrophysics, 3) understanding recent local star formation, and 4) the study of\nlocal galactic kinematics. Information available now allows us to identify 8\nlikely new members in the list. Two of these, a late-K and an early-M dwarf, we\nfind to be likely members of the Beta Pic group. The other six stars are likely\nmembers of the AB Dor moving group. These include an M dwarf triple system, and\nthree very cool objects that may be young brown dwarfs, making them the\nlowest-mass, isolated objects proposed in the AB Dor moving group to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 12:55:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To\nreconstruct a shower cascade curve from measurements of the number of photons\narriving from the subsequent shower track elements it is necessary to take into\naccount the multiple scatterings that photons undergo on their way from the\nshower to the detector. In contrast to the earlier Monte-Carlo work, we present\nhere an analytical method to treat the Rayleigh and Mie scatterings in the\natmosphere. The method consists in considering separately the consecutive\n'generations' of the scattered light.

In this asymptotic limit we show that the\ncorrect dynamical equation for multimode amplitude distributions is not the\nwell-known equation of Peierls but is instead a reduced equation with only a\nsubset of the terms in that equation. The equations that we derive are the\ndirect analogue of the Boltzmann hierarchy obtained from the BBGKY hierarchy in\nthe low-density limit for gases. We show that the asymptotic multimode\nequations possess factorized solutions for factorized initial data, which\ncorrespond to preservation in time of the property of \"random phases &\namplitudes\". The factors satisfy the equations for the 1-mode probability\ndensity functions previously derived by Jakobsen & Newell and Choi et al. We\nshow that the factorization of the hierarchy equations implies that these\nquantities are self-averaging: they satisfy the wave-kinetic closure equations\nof the spectrum and 1-mode PDF for almost any selection of phases and\namplitudes from the initial ensemble. We show that both of these closure\nequations satisfy an H-theorem for an entropy defined by Boltzmann's\nprescription. We also characterize the general solutions of our multimode\ndistribution equations, for initial conditions with random phases but with no\nassumptions on the amplitudes. Analogous to a result of Spohn for the Boltzmann\nhierarchy, these are \"super-statistical solutions\" that correspond to ensembles\nof solutions of the wave-kinetic closure equations with random initial\nconditions or random forces. On the basis of our results, we discuss possible\nkinetic explanations of intermittency and non-Gaussian statistics in wave\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 14:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 21:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The BHk stars are found in UV color-magnitude diagrams of the most\nmassive globular clusters, where they fall at luminosities immediately below\nthe hot end of the horizontal branch (HB), in a region of the HR diagram\nunexplained by canonical stellar evolution theory. Using new evolutionary and\natmospheric models, we have shown that these subluminous HB stars are very\nlikely the progeny of stars that undergo extensive internal mixing during a\nlate He-core flash on the white dwarf cooling curve. This flash mixing leads to\nhotter temperatures and an enormous enhancement of the surface He and C; these\nhotter temperatures, together with the decrease in H opacity shortward of the\nLyman limit, make the BHk stars brighter in the EUV while appearing subluminous\nin the UV and optical. Our FUV spectroscopy demonstrates that, relative to\nnormal HB stars at the same color, the BHk stars of NGC2808 are hotter and\ngreatly enhanced in He and C, thus providing unambiguous evidence of flash\nmixing. Although the C abundance in the BHk stars is orders of magnitude larger\nthan that in the normal HB stars, the C abundance in both the BHk and normal HB\nstars appears to be affected by gravitational settling. The variations seen in\nSi and the Fe-peak elements also indicate that atmospheric diffusion is at play\nin our sample, with all of our hot subdwarfs at 25,000 to 50,000 K exhibiting\nlarge enhancements of the Fe-peak elements. The hottest subdwarfs in our BHk\nsample may be pulsators, given that they fall in the temperature range of\nnewly-discovered pulsating subdwarfs in omega Cen. In addition to the normal\nhot HB and BHk stars, we obtain spectra of 5 blue HB stars, a post-HB star, and\n3 unclassified stars with unusually blue UV colors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 14:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In addition, a\npossible pulsar wind nebula CXO J192318.5+140305 was found likely associated\nwith the supernova remnant. Gamma-ray emission from this region was discovered\nby Fermi/LAT (between 0.2 and 50 GeV) and H.E.S.S. (>1 TeV). The spatial\ndistribution of the events could not be used to pinpoint the location of the\nemission among the pulsar wind nebula, the supernova remnant shell and/or the\nmolecular cloud. However, the modeling of the spectral energy distribution\npresented by the Fermi/LAT collaboration suggests a hadronic emission\nmechanism. We performed observations of the W51 complex with the MAGIC\ntelescopes for more than 50 hours. The good angular resolution in the medium\n(few hundred GeV) to high (above 1 TeV) energies allow us to perform\nmorphological studies. We detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gamma\nrays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations.

The possible contribution of\nthe pulsar wind nebula, assuming a point-like source, shows no dependence on\nenergy and it is about 20% of the overall emission. The broad band spectral\nenergy distribution can be explained with a hadronic model that implies proton\nacceleration above 100 TeV. This result, together with the morphology of the\nsource, tentatively suggests that we observe ongoing acceleration of ions in\nthe interaction zone between supernova remnant and cloud.
