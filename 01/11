Another problem is single-point\ndefenses (e.g. firewalls) lack the scalability needed to handle an increase in\nthe attack traffic.

We investigate the statistics regarding the arrival rates of both\nnormal TCP SYN packets and SYN flood attack packets. We then describe a new\ndetection mechanism based on these statistics.

In\nthis paper we describe a concrete counterexample: a binary with $m_1/m_2=4$,\n$a_1=0.6 \\hat{x} = -a_2$, placed in orbit in the x,y plane. We extract the\ngravitational wave emission along several proposed emission directions,\nincluding the initial (Newtonian) orbital angular momentum; the final (~\ninitial) total angular momentum; and the dominant principal axis of $<L_a\nL_b>_M$. Using several diagnostics, we show that the suggested preferred\ndirections are not representative. For example, only for a handful of other\ndirections (< 15%) will the gravitational wave signal have comparable shape to\nthe one extracted along each of these fiducial directions, as measured by a\ngeneralized overlap (>0.95). We conclude that the information available in just\none direction (or mode) does not adequately encode the complexity of\norientation-dependent emission for even short signals from merging black hole\nbinaries. Future investigations of precessing, unequal-mass binaries should\ncarefully explore and model their orientation-dependent emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 17:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 00:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We present\nresults from an ongoing study of prompt black hole formation via scalar field\ncollapse, and explore the subsequent quasi-normal ringdown. Beginning with\ninitial data characterized by highly distorted apparent horizon geometries, the\nmetrics quickly evolve, via quasi-normal ringdown, to equilibrium static black\nhole solutions at late times. The lowest angular number quasi-normal modes are\nconsistent with the linear modes previously found in perturbative studies,\nwhereas the higher angular modes are a combination of linear modes and of\nharmonics arising from non-linear mode-coupling. We extract the stress energy\ntensor of the dual CFT on the boundary, and find that despite being highly\ninhomogeneous initially, it nevertheless evolves from the outset in a manner\nthat is consistent with a thermalized N=4 SYM fluid. As a first step towards\ncloser contact with relativistic heavy ion collision physics, we map this\nsolution to a Minkowski piece of the R{\\times}S3 boundary, and obtain a\ncorresponding fluid flow in Minkowski space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 18:29:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2012 02:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 04:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

A number of millimeter and submillimeter facilities with linear\npolarization observing capabilities have started operating during last years.\nThese facilities, as well as other previous millimeter telescopes and\ninterferometers, require bright and stable linear polarization calibrators to\ncalibrate new instruments and to monitor their instrumental polarization. The\ncurrent limited number of adequate calibrators implies difficulties in the\nacquisition of these calibration observations. (Aims.) Looking for additional\nlinear polarization calibrators in the millimeter spectral range, in mid-2006\nwe started monitoring 3C 286, a standard and highly stable polarization\ncalibrator for radio observations. (Methods.) Here we present the 3 and 1 mm\nmonitoring observations obtained between September 2006 and January 2012 with\nthe XPOL polarimeter on the IRAM 30 m Millimeter Telescope. (Results.) Our\nobservations show that 3C 286 is a bright source of constant total flux with 3\nmm flux density S_3mm = (0.91 \\pm 0.02) Jy. The 3mm linear polarization degree\n(p_3mm =[13.5\\pm0.3]%) and polarization angle (chi_3mm\n=[37.3\\pm0.8]deg.,expressed in the equatorial coordinate system) are also\nconstant during the time span of our observations. Although with poorer time\nsampling and signal-to-noise ratio, our 1 mm observations of 3C 286 are also\nreproduced by a constant source of 1 mm flux density (S_1mm = [0.30 \\pm 0.03]\nJy), polarization fraction (p_1mm = [14.4 \\pm 1.8] %), and polarization angle\n(chi_1mm = [33.1 \\pm 5.7]deg.). (Conclusions.) This, together with the\npreviously known compact structure of 3C 286 -extended by ~3.5\" in the sky-\nallow us to propose 3C 286 as a new calibrator for both single dish and\ninterferometric polarization observations at 3 mm, and possibly at shorter\nwavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 19:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 17:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Consequently, cloud collisions are\nwidely ignored as a source of viscosity in galactic disks. However, capturing\nthe hydrodynamics of discs in simple analytic models is a challenge, both\nbecause of the wide dynamic range and importance of 2D and 3D effects. To test\nthe validity of analytic models we present estimates for the viscous time-scale\nthat are measured from three dimensional SPH simulations of disc formation and\nevolution. We have deliberately removed uncertainties associated with\nstar-formation and feedback thereby enabling us to place lower bounds on the\ntime-scale for this process. We also contrast collapse simulations with results\nfrom simulations of initially stable discs and examine the impact of numerical\nparameters and assumptions on our work, to constrain possible systematics in\nour estimates. We find that cloud-collision viscous time-scales are in the\nrange of 0.6-16 Gyr, considerably shorter than previously estimated. This large\ndiscrepency can be understood in terms of how the efficiency of collisions is\nincluded in the analytical estimates. We find that the viscous time-scale only\ndepends weakly on the number of clouds formed, and so while the viscous\ntime-scale will increase with increasing resolution, this effect is too weak to\nalter our conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 20:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Upon electrolyte addition, the\ncomposite electrode rapidly develops compressive stress of the order of 1-2 MPa\ndue to binder swelling; upon continued exposure, the stress continues to evolve\ntowards an apparent plateau. During electrochemical intercalation at a slow\nrate, the compressive stress increases with the electrode's state-of-charge,\nreaching a maximum value of 10 - 12 MPa. There appears to be an approximate\ncorrelation between the rate of stress rise and the staging behavior of the\nlithiated graphite. De-intercalation at a slow rate results in a similar linear\ndecrease in electrode stress. Tensile stress of a few MPa develops at the end\nof deintercalation in the first few cycles, after which the electrode remains\nunder compressive stress only. Although higher peak stresses are seen at high\nC-rates, the dependence appears to be relatively weak (up to 5C). These\nmeasurements reveal, for the first time, the nature of stress evolution in\npractical lithium-ion-battery electrodes and provide useful data to quantify\nthe driving force for mechanical damage that accrues in composite electrodes\nupon repeated cycling. While the reported results can serve as reference for\ncalibrating theoretical and computational models to predict electrode stress\nand damage evolution, the methodology demonstrated can be used to measure\nstresses and characterize fatigue damage in any composite lithium-ion-battery\nelectrode as well as optimize its microstructure to mitigate stress-related\ndamage mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 20:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

By comparing colors, optical and\nnear-infrared spectra, we find remarkable agreement between the two, implying\nsimilar effective temperatures and metallicities. Both are metal-poor compared\nto the Solar neighborhood, have low projected rotational velocity, high\nabsolute radial velocity, large proper motion and no quiescent H-alpha\nemission--all of which is consistent with being old M dwarfs. We combine\nempirical measurements of Barnard's Star and expectations from evolutionary\nisochrones to estimate KOI 961's mass (0.13 +/- 0.05 Msun), radius (0.17 +/-\n0.04 Rsun) and luminosity (2.40 x 10^(-3.0 +/- 0.3) Lsun). We calculate KOI\n961's distance (38.7 +/- 6.3 pc) and space motions, which, like Barnard's Star,\nare consistent with a high scale-height population in the Milky Way. We perform\nan independent multi-transit fit to the public Kepler light curve and\nsignificantly revise the transit parameters for the three planets. We calculate\nthe false-positive probability for each planet-candidate, and find a less than\n1% chance that any one of the transiting signals is due to a background or\nhierarchical eclipsing binary, validating the planetary nature of the transits.\nThe best-fitting radii for all three planets are less than 1 Rearth, with KOI\n961.03 being Mars-sized (Rp = 0.57 +/- 0.18 Rearth), and they represent some of\nthe smallest exoplanets detected to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 21:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In such scenarios, it is often required to compress and\ndecompress every sequence individually. However, the universal compression of\nthe individual sequences suffers from significant redundancy overhead. In this\npaper, we aim at answering whether or not having a memory unit in the middle\ncan result in a fundamental gain in the universal compression. We present the\nproblem setup in the most basic scenario consisting of a server node $S$, a\nrelay node $R$ (i.e., the memory unit), and a client node $C$. We assume that\nserver $S$ wishes to send the sequence $x^n$ to the client $C$ who has never\nhad any prior communication with the server, and hence, is not capable of\nmemorization of the source context. However, $R$ has previously communicated\nwith $S$ to forward previous sequences from $S$ to the clients other than $C$,\nand thus, $R$ has memorized a context $y^m$ shared with $S$. Note that if the\nrelay node was absent the source could possibly apply universal compression to\n$x^n$ and transmit to $C$ whereas the presence of memorized context at $R$ can\npossibly reduce the communication overhead in $S$-$R$ link. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the fundamental gain of the context memorization in the\nmemory-assisted universal compression of the sequence $x^n$ over conventional\nuniversal source coding by providing a lower bound on the gain of\nmemory-assisted source coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 22:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

CME-induced dimming regions are found\nto be characterized by significant blueshift and enhanced line width by using a\nsingle Gaussian fit. While a red-blue (RB) asymmetry analysis and a RB-guided\ndouble Gaussian fit of the coronal line profiles indicate that these are likely\ncaused by the superposition of a strong background emission component and a\nrelatively weak (~10%) high-speed (~100 km s-1) upflow component. This finding\nsuggests that the outflow velocity in the dimming region is probably of the\norder of 100 km s-1, not ~20 km s-1 as reported previously. Density and\ntemperature diagnostics suggest that dimming is primarily an effect of density\ndecrease rather than temperature change. The mass losses in dimming regions as\nestimated from different methods are roughly consistent with each other and\nthey are 20%-60% of the masses of the associated CMEs. With the guide of RB\nasymmetry analysis, we also find several temperature-dependent outflows (speed\nincreases with temperature) immediately outside the (deepest) dimming region.\nIn an erupted CME loop and an EUV jet, profiles of emission lines formed at\ncoronal and transition region temperatures are found to exhibit two\nwell-separated components, an almost stationary component accounting for the\nbackground emission and a highly blueshifted (~200 km s-1) component\nrepresenting emission from the erupting material. The two components can easily\nbe decomposed through a double Gaussian fit and we can diagnose the electron\ndensity, temperature and mass of the ejecta. Combining the speed of the\nblueshifted component and the projected speed of the erupting material derived\nfrom simultaneous imaging observations, we can calculate the real speed of the\nejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 22:52:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-20"}

It has been the subject of decades of work in\nthe information and coding (I&C) community. This paper bridges the gap between\nthis body of work and modern cryptography with contributions along two fronts,\nnamely metrics (definitions) of security, and schemes. We explain that the\nmetric currently in use is weak and insufficient to guarantee security of\napplications and propose two replacements. One, that we call mis-security, is a\nmutual-information based metric in the I&C style. The other, semantic security,\nadapts to this setting a cryptographic metric that, in the cryptography\ncommunity, has been vetted by decades of evaluation and endorsed as the target\nfor standards and implementations. We show that they are equivalent (any scheme\nsecure under one is secure under the other), thereby connecting two\nfundamentally different ways of defining security and providing a strong,\nunified and well-founded target for designs. Moving on to schemes, results from\nthe wiretap community are mostly non-constructive, proving the existence of\nschemes without necessarily yielding ones that are explicit, let alone\nefficient, and only meeting their weak notion of security. We apply\ncryptographic methods based on extractors to produce explicit, polynomial-time\nand even practical encryption schemes that meet our new and stronger security\ntarget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 22:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 01:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The module serves\nseveral purposes: it can be used to generate spectra and images, to compute a\nvariable Eddington tensor (VET) for full radiation MHD simulations, and to\ncalculate the heating and cooling source terms in the MHD equations in flows\nwhere radiation pressure is small compared with gas pressure.

This algorithm\nsolves the radiation moment equations in the mixed frame, without invoking any\ndiffusion-like approximations. The moment equations are closed using a variable\nEddington tensor whose components are calculated from a formal solution of the\ntransfer equation at a large number of angles using the method of short\ncharacteristics. We use a comprehensive test suite to verify the algorithm,\nincluding convergence tests of radiation-modified linear acoustic and\nmagnetosonic waves, the structure of radiation modified shocks, and\ntwo-dimensional tests of photon bubble instability and the ablation of dense\nclouds by an intense radiation field. These tests cover a very wide range of\nregimes, including both optically thick and thin flows, and ratios of the\nradiation to gas pressure of at least 10^{-4} to 10^{4}. Across most of the\nparameter space, we find the method is accurate. However, the tests also reveal\nthere are regimes where the method needs improvement, for example when both the\nradiation pressure and absorption opacity are very large. We suggest\nmodifications to the algorithm that will improve accuracy in this case. We\ndiscuss the advantages of this method over those based on flux-limited\ndiffusion. In particular, we find the method is not only substantially more\naccurate, but often no more expensive than the diffusion approximation for our\nintended applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 02:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-05"}

The Weibull distribution is often used to model the\nearthquake ITD.

We obtain Weibull ITD for power-law stress accumulation, i.e.,\n$\\sigma(t) = \\alpha t^{\\beta}$, where $\\beta >0$ for single faults or systems\nwith homogeneous strength statistics. We show that logarithmic stress\naccumulation leads to the log-Weibull ITD.

The spatial organization of\nthe component particles in this shell is similar to the capsomer proteins\nforming the capsid of a T=1 virus. Growth occurs in the presence of an\natomistic solvent and, under suitable conditions, achieves a high yield of\ncomplete shells. The simulations provide details of the structure and lifetime\nof the particle clusters that appear as intermediate states along the growth\npathway, and the nature of the transitions between them. In certain respects\nthe growth of size-60 shells from trapezoidal particles resembles the growth of\nicosahedral shells from triangular particles studied previously, with\nreversible bonding playing a major role in avoiding incorrect assembly,\nalthough the details differ due to particle shape and bond organization. The\nstrong preference for maximal bonding exhibited by the triangular particle\nclusters is also apparent for trapezoidal particles, but this is now confined\nto early growth, and is less pronounced as shells approach completion along a\nvariety of pathways.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 09:26:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 11:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 11:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 09:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-05"}

We will be interested in bandwidth\nallocations which scale in this \\textit{iso-elastic} manner and, also, maximize\na utility function.\n  Utility optimizing bandwidth allocations have been frequently studied, and a\npopular choice of utility function are the weighted $\\alpha$-fair utility\nfunctions introduced by Mo and Walrand \\cite{MoWa00}.

Planet formation in binary-star systems both depend on the\ncompanion star parameters and on the properties of the circumstellar disc. An\neccentric disc may increase the impact velocity of planetesimals and therefore\njeopardize the accumulation process. We model the evolution of discs in close\nbinaries including the effects of self-gravity and adopting different\nprescriptions to model the disc's radiative properties. We focus on the\ndynamical properties and evolutionary tracks of the discs. We use the\nhydrodynamical code FARGO and we include in the energy equation heating and\ncooling effects. Radiative discs have a lower disc eccentricity compared to\nlocally isothermal discs with same temperature profile. As a consequence, we do\nnot observe the formation of an internal elliptical low density region as in\nlocally isothermal disc models. However, the disc eccentricity depends on the\ndisc mass through the opacities. Akin to locally isothermal disc models,\nself-gravity forces the disc's longitude of pericenter to librate about a fixed\norientation with respect to the binary apsidal line ($\\pi$). The disc's\nradiative properties play an important role in the evolution of discs in\nbinaries. A radiative disc has an overall shape and internal structure that are\nsignificantly different compared to a locally isothermal disc with same\ntemperature profile. This is an important finding both for describing the\nevolutionary track of the disc during its progressive mass loss, and for planet\nformation since the internal structure of the disc is relevant for\nplanetesimals growth in binary systems. The non-symmetrical distribution of\nmass in these discs causes large eccentricities for planetesimals that may\naffect their growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 12:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

A general outer bound on\nthe rate-distortion-equivocation region, as well as an inner bound based on a\npure digital scheme, is derived for arbitrary channels and side informations.\nIn some special cases of interest, it is proved that this digital scheme is\noptimal and that separation holds. However, it is also shown through a simple\ncounterexample with a binary source that a pure analog scheme can outperform\nthe digital one while being optimal. According to these observations and\nassuming matched bandwidth, a novel hybrid digital/analog scheme that aims to\ngather the advantages of both digital and analog ones is then presented. In the\nquadratic Gaussian setup when side information is only present at the\neavesdropper, this strategy is proved to be optimal. Furthermore, it\noutperforms both digital and analog schemes, and cannot be achieved via\ntime-sharing. By means of an appropriate coding, the presence of any\nstatistical difference among the side informations, the channel noises, and the\ndistortion at Bob can be fully exploited in terms of secrecy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 14:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2013 08:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-11"}

We present an easy, inexpensive, and\nefficient method which uses a neon lamp as a flat field source and produces\nhigh S/N fringe frames to use for defringing an image during the calibration\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 15:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The topological structure of an observed network is\nmodelled by the relative prevalence of a set of local sub-graph configurations\ntermed network statistics. One of the key tasks in the application of these\nmodels is which network statistics to include in the model. This can be thought\nof as statistical model selection problem. This is a very challenging\nproblem---the posterior distribution for each model is often termed \"doubly\nintractable\" since computation of the likelihood is rarely available, but also,\nthe evidence of the posterior is, as usual, intractable. The contribution of\nthis paper is the development of a fully Bayesian model selection method based\non a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm extension of Caimo and\nFriel (2011) which estimates the posterior probability for each competing\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 15:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 11:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 09:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-21"}

Their\nsensitivity to single-particle structure complements one-nucleon removal\nreaction capabilities in the quest to reveal the evolution of nuclear shell\nstructure in very exotic nuclei. Purpose: To add intermediate-energy,\ncarbon-target-induced one-proton pickup reactions to the arsenal of\n$\\gamma$-ray tagged direct reactions applicable in the regime of low beam\nintensities and to apply these for the first time to $fp$-shell nuclei.\nMethods: Inclusive and partial cross sections were measured for the\n$\\nuc{12}{C}(\\nuc{48}{Cr},\\nuc{49}{Mn}+\\gamma)$X and\n$\\nuc{12}{C}(\\nuc{50}{Fe},\\nuc{51}{Co}+\\gamma)$X proton pickup reactions at\n56.7 and 61.2 MeV/nucleon, respectively, using coincident particle-$\\gamma$\nspectroscopy at the NSCL. The results are compared to reaction theory\ncalculations using $fp$-shell-model nuclear structure input. For comparison\nwith our previous work, the same reactions were measured on \\nuc{9}{Be}\ntargets. Results: The measured partial cross sections confirm the specific\npopulation pattern predicted by theory, with pickup into high-$\\ell$ orbitals\nbeing strongly favored; driven by linear and angular momentum matching.\nConclusion: Carbon target-induced pickup reactions are well-suited, in the\nregime of modest beam intensity, to study the evolution of nuclear structure,\nwith specific sensitivities that are well described by theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 15:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2012 20:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

The universe just is and no further explanation for\nits existence is possible. In this paper I explain why this question must have\nan answer, and why that answer must establish that physical existence is\ninescapable and necessary. Based on the conclusion that if the universe is\neternal rather than having a beginning some finite time in the past, the\nuniverse has to exist rather than not because its possible non-existence is\nnever an option, such an explanation is put forward. As a logical extension of\nonly an eternal universe being capable of providing an answer to the question\nof why there is something rather than nothing, the argument necessitates that\nthe universe must be eternal. The consequences of this conclusion for cosmology\nare then briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 22:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-15"}
