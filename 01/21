While the\nimportance of RNNs, especially as models of brain processing, is undisputed, it\nis also widely acknowledged that the computations in standard RNN models may be\nan over-simplification of what real neuronal networks compute. Here, we suggest\nthat the RNN approach may be made both neurobiologically more plausible and\ncomputationally more powerful by its fusion with Bayesian inference techniques\nfor nonlinear dynamical systems. In this scheme, we use an RNN as a generative\nmodel of dynamic input caused by the environment, e.g. of speech or kinematics.\nGiven this generative RNN model, we derive Bayesian update equations that can\ndecode its output. Critically, these updates define a 'recognizing RNN' (rRNN),\nin which neurons compute and exchange prediction and prediction error messages.\nThe rRNN has several desirable features that a conventional RNN does not have,\nfor example, fast decoding of dynamic stimuli and robustness to initial\nconditions and noise. Furthermore, it implements a predictive coding scheme for\ndynamic inputs. We suggest that the Bayesian inversion of recurrent neural\nnetworks may be useful both as a model of brain function and as a machine\nlearning tool.

This gives sequences of physical models in the plane of\nglobal anisotropy and flattening. The tracer may have any density, though there\nare particularly simple results for power-laws and exponentials. We prove the\nflattening theorem: for a spheroidally stratified tracer density with axis\nratio q in a dark density potential with axis ratio g, the ratio of globally\naveraged equatorial to vertical velocity dispersion depends only on q/g. As the\nstellar halo density and velocity dispersion of the Milky Way are accessible to\nobservations, this provides a new method for measuring the flattening of the\ndark matter. If the kinematics of the local halo subdwarfs are representative,\nthen the Milky Way's dark halo is oblate with a flattening in the potential of\ng ~ 0.85, corresponding to a flattening in the dark matter density of ~ 0.7.\nThe fractional pressure excess for power-law populations is roughly\nproportional to both the ellipticity and the fall-off exponent. Given the same\npressure excess, if the density profile of one stellar population declines more\nquickly than that of another, then it must be rounder. This implies that the\ndual halo structure claimed by Carollo et al. (2007) for the Galaxy, a flatter\ninner halo and a rounder outer halo, is inconsistent with the virial theorem.\nFor the thick disc, we provide formulae for the virial sequences of\ndouble-exponential discs in logarithmic and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) haloes.\nThere are good matches to the observational data on the flattening and\nanisotropy of the thick disc if the thin disc is exponential with a short\nscalelength ~ 2.6 kpc and normalisation of 56 solar masses per square parsec,\ntogether with a logarithmic dark halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 17:19:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 12:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2012 11:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

However, some controversy remains even on the\nbasic effects resulting from the mixing of temperatures along the\nline-of-sight.\n  Studies have suggested either a positive or a negative correlation between\nthe colour temperature T_C and the observed spectral index beta_Obs. Our aim is\nto show that both cases are possible and to determine the factors leading to\neither behaviour. We start by studying the sum of two or three modified black\nbodies of different temperature. With radiative transfer modelling, we examine\nthe probability distributions of the dust mass as a function of the physical\ndust temperature. With these results as a guideline, we examine the (T_C,\nbeta_Obs) relations for different sets of clouds.\n  Even in the case of modified blackbodies at temperatures T_0 and T_0+ Delta\nT_0, the correlation between T_C and beta_Obs can be either positive or\nnegative. If one compares models where Delta T_0 is varied, the correlation is\nnegative. If the models differ in their mean temperature T_0 rather than in\nDelta T_0, the correlation remains positive. Radiative transfer models show\nthat externally heated clouds have different mean temperatures but the widths\nof their temperature distributions are rather similar. Thus, the correlation\nbetween T_C and beta_Obs is expected to be positive. The same result applies to\nclouds illuminated by external radiation fields of different intensity. For\ninternally heated clouds a negative correlation is the more likely alternative.\n  If the signal-to-noise ratio is high, the observed negative correlation could\nbe explained by the temperature dependence of the dust optical properties but\nthat intrinsic dependence could be even steeper than the observed one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 18:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Thereby the achievable quantum communication\nrate is fundamentally limited by the amount of energy that can be transmitted\nper use of the channel. It is hence vital to develop quantum communication\nprotocols that encode quantum information as energy efficiently as possible. To\nthis aim we investigate continuous-variable quantum teleportation as a method\nof distributing quantum information.

We argue that the\nstellar IMF and core mass function (CMF) should be associated with the\nlast-crossing distribution, i.e. the mass spectrum of bound objects defined on\nthe smallest scale on which they are self-gravitating. This differs from the\nfirst-crossing distribution (mass function on the largest self-gravitating\nscale) which is defined cosmologically and which H11 show corresponds to the\nGMC mass function in disks. We derive an analytic equation for the\nlast-crossing distribution that can be used for an arbitrary collapse threshold\nin ISM and cosmological studies. With this, we show that the same model that\npredicts the GMC mass function and large-scale structure of galaxy disks also\npredicts the CMF (and by extrapolation IMF) in good agreement with\nobservations. The only adjustable parameter in the model is the turbulent\nvelocity power spectrum, which in the range p~5/3-2 gives similar results.

We identify\nlong-term X-ray variability (~month-years, observed frame) in 20 of 92 CDF-S\ngalaxies spanning redshifts z~0.08-1.02 that do not meet other AGN selection\ncriteria. We show that the observed variability cannot be explained by X-ray\nbinary populations or ultraluminous X-ray sources, so the variability is most\nlikely caused by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. The variable\ngalaxies are not heavily obscured in general, with a stacked effective\npower-law photon index of Gamma_stack~1.93+/-0.13, and are therefore likely\nLLAGN. The LLAGN tend to lie a factor of ~6-80 below the extrapolated linear\nvariability-luminosity relation measured for luminous AGN. This may be\nexplained by their lower accretion rates. Variability-independent black-hole\nmass and accretion-rate estimates for variable galaxies show that they sample a\nsignificantly different black-hole mass-accretion rate space, with masses a\nfactor of 2.4 lower and accretion rates a factor of 22.5 lower than variable\nluminous AGN at the same redshift.

Accurate AGN host stellar masses are measured by decomposing\ntheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components.

Our\nempirical approach suggests that known galaxy populations are not responsible\nfor the bulk of the fluctuation signal seen in the measurements and favors a\nvery faint population of highly clustered sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 21:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 17:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2012 19:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It is important to understand their instrumental or\nenvironmental origin so that they could be eliminated or accounted for in the\ndata. Since the number of triggers is large, data mining approaches such as\nclustering and classification are useful tools for this task. Classification of\ntriggers based on a handful of discrete properties has been done in the past. A\nrich information content is available in the waveform or 'shape' of the\ntriggers that has had a rather restricted exploration so far. This paper\npresents a new way to classify triggers deriving information from both trigger\nwaveforms as well as their discrete physical properties using a sequential\ncombination of the Longest Common Sub-Sequence (LCSS) and LCSS coupled with\nFast Time Series Evaluation (FTSE) for waveform classification and the\nmultidimensional hierarchical classification (MHC) analysis for the grouping\nbased on physical properties. A generalized k-means algorithm is used with the\nLCSS (and LCSS+FTSE) for clustering the triggers using a validity measure to\ndetermine the correct number of clusters in absence of any prior knowledge. The\nresults have been demonstrated by simulations and by application to a segment\nof real LIGO data from the sixth science run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 21:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The mimetic discretization presented in this paper and in [50] is\na higher-order method for curvilinear quadrilaterals and hexahedrals.\nFundamental is the underlying structure of oriented geometric objects, the\nrelation between these objects through the boundary operator and how this\ndefines the exterior derivative, representing the grad, curl and div, through\nthe generalized Stokes theorem. The mimetic method presented here uses the\nlanguage of differential $k$-forms with $k$-cochains as their discrete\ncounterpart, and the relations between them in terms of the mimetic operators:\nreduction, reconstruction and projection. The reconstruction consists of the\nrecently developed mimetic spectral interpolation functions. The most important\nresult of the mimetic framework is the commutation between differentiation at\nthe continuous level with that on the finite dimensional and discrete level. As\na result operators like gradient, curl and divergence are discretized exactly.\nFor Stokes flow, this implies a pointwise divergence-free solution. This is\nconfirmed using a set of test cases on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes.\nIt will be shown that the method converges optimally for all admissible\nboundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 22:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 09:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

For two-layer systems of identical two-component\nreactions, we analyze the stability of homogeneous steady states by exploiting\nthe block symmetric structure of the linear problem. There are eight possible\nprimary bifurcation scenarios, including a Turing-Turing bifurcation that\ninvolves two disparate length scales whose ratio may be tuned via the\ninter-layer coupling. For systems of $n$-component layers and non-identical\nlayers, the linear problem's block form allows approximate decomposition into\nlower-dimensional linear problems if the coupling is sufficiently weak. As an\nexample, we apply these results to a two-layer Brusselator system. The\ncompeting length scales engineered within the linear problem are readily\napparent in numerical simulations of the full system. Selecting a $\\sqrt{2}$:1\nlength scale ratio produces an unusual steady square pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2012 01:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Furthermore, we study the\ncapabilities of future CMB measurements, Planck and CMBPol, on the constraints\nof $\\Delta\\alpha$ and $\\epsilon$. We find that the constraint of $\\Delta\\alpha$\ncan be significantly improved by a factor of 15. Therefore, if this rotation\nangle effect can not be taken into account properly, the constraints of\ncosmological parameters will be biased obviously. For the gravitational CS\nterm, the future Planck data still can not constrain $\\epsilon$ very well, if\nthe primordial tensor perturbations are small, $r <0.1$. We need the more\naccurate CMBPol experiment to give better constraint on $\\epsilon$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2012 09:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this\npaper, it is shown that for MIMO two-way relaying, deep fade occurs at the\nrelay when the row space of the channel fade coefficient matrix is a subspace\nof a finite number of vector subspaces of $\\mathbb{C}^{n_A+n_B}$ which are\nreferred to as the singular fade subspaces. It is shown that proper choice of\nnetwork coding map can remove most of the singular fade subspaces, referred to\nas the removable singular fade subspaces. For $2^{\\lambda}$-PSK signal set, it\nis shown that the number of non-removable singular fade subspaces is a small\nfraction of the total number of singular fade subspaces. The Latin Rectangles\nfor the case when the end nodes use different number of antennas are shown to\nbe obtainable from the Latin Squares for the case when they use the same number\nof antennas. Also, the network coding maps which remove all the removable\nsingular singular fade subspaces are shown to be obtainable from a small set of\nLatin Squares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2012 14:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 16:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-15"}

Due to usually\nhazardous environment and limited resources, e.g. energy, sensors in the\nnetwork are vulnerable. Also due to the large size of the network, gathering\ninformation from a few central hopes is not feasible. Flooding is not a desired\noption either due to limited memory of each node. Therefore the best approach\nto increase data persistency is propagating data throughout the network by\nrandom walks. The algorithm proposed here is based on distributed LT (Luby\nTransform) codes and it benefits from the low complexity of encoding and\ndecoding of LT codes. In previous algorithms the essential global information\n(e.g., n and k) are estimated based on graph statistics, which requires\nexcessive transmissions. In our proposed algorithm, these values are obtained\nwithout additional transmissions. Also the mixing time of random walk is\nenhanced by proposing a new scheme for generating the probabilistic forwarding\ntable of random walk.

To accomplish this task, each node updates its state by a\nweighted average of its own and neighbors' states, by using local communication\nbetween neighboring nodes. In the networks with fixed topology, convergence\nrate of distributed average consensus algorithm depends on the choice of\nweights. This paper studies the weight optimization problem in distributed\naverage consensus algorithm. The network topology considered here is a star\nnetwork where the branches have different lengths. Closed-form formulas of\noptimal weights and convergence rate of algorithm are determined in terms of\nthe network's topological parameters.

EEG motion artifacts are used to generate motion regressors\ndescribing rotational head movements with millisecond temporal resolution.\nThese regressors are utilized for slice-specific motion correction of\nunprocessed fMRI data. Performance of the method is demonstrated by correction\nof fMRI data from five patients with major depressive disorder, who exhibited\nhead movements by 1-3 mm during a resting EEG-fMRI run. The fMRI datasets,\ncorrected using eight to ten EEG-based motion regressors, show significant\nimprovements in temporal SNR (TSNR) of fMRI time series, particularly in the\nfrontal brain regions and near the surface of the brain. The TSNR improvements\nare as high as 50% for large brain areas in single-subject analysis and as high\nas 25% when the results are averaged across the subjects. Simultaneous\napplication of the EEG-based motion correction and physiological noise\ncorrection by means of RETROICOR leads to average TSNR enhancements as high as\n35% for large brain regions. These TSNR improvements are largely preserved\nafter the subsequent fMRI volume registration and regression of fMRI motion\nparameters. The proposed EEG-assisted method of retrospective fMRI motion\ncorrection (referred to as E-REMCOR) can be used to improve quality of fMRI\ndata with severe motion artifacts and to reduce spurious correlations between\nthe EEG and fMRI data caused by head movements.
