Fundaments of fringe frequencies in the uv-plane are discussed\nand filters are used to attenuate radio-frequency interference (RFI) and\noff-axis sources. Several new applications of filters are introduced and\ntested. A low-pass filter in time and frequency direction on single baseline\ndata is successfully used to lower the noise in the area of interest and to\nremove sidelobes coming from unmodelled off-axis sources and RFI. Related side\neffects of data integration, averaging and gridding are analysed, and shown to\nbe able to cause ghosts and an increase in noise, especially when using long\nbaselines or interferometric elements that have a large field of view. A novel\nprojected fringe low-pass filter is shown to be potentially useful for first\norder source separation. Initial tests show that the filters can be several\nfactors faster compared to common source separation techniques such as peeling\nand a variant of peeling that is currently being tested on LOFAR observations\ncalled \"demixed peeling\". Further testing is required to support the\nperformance of the filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 16:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-02"}

In\nmany earlier studies spherical symmetry has been assumed partly because of\nlimited data quality, however new deep observations and instrumental designs\nwill make it possible to go beyond that assumption. Measuring the temperature\nand density profiles are of interest when observing the x-ray gas, however the\nspatial shape of the gas itself also carries very useful information. For\nexample, it is believed that the x-ray gas shape in the inner parts of galaxy\nclusters is greatly affected by feedback mechanisms, cooling and rotation, and\nmeasuring this shape can therefore indirectly provide information on these\nmechanisms. In this paper we present a novel method to measure the\nthree-dimensional shape of the intracluster x-ray emitting gas. We can measure\nthe shape from the x-ray observations only, i.e. the method does not require\ncombination with independent measurements of e.g. the cluster mass or density\nprofile. This is possible when one uses the full spectral information contained\nin the observed spectra. We demonstrate the method by measuring radial\ndependent shapes along the line of sight for CHANDRA mock data. We find that at\nleast 10^6 photons are required to get a 5-{\\sigma} detection of shape for an\nx-ray gas having realistic features such as a cool core and a double powerlaw\nfor the density profile. We illustrate how Bayes' theorem is used to find the\nbest fitting model of the x-ray gas, an analysis that is very important in a\nreal observational scenario where the true spatial shape is unknown. Not\nincluding a shape in the fit may propagate to a mass bias if the x-ray is used\nto estimate the total cluster mass. We discuss this mass bias for a class of\nspacial shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 17:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 19:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}

The\nfamiliar chess pieces move about according to their usual chess rules, and each\nplayer strives to place the opposing king into checkmate. The mate-in-n problem\nof infinite chess is the problem of determining whether a designated player can\nforce a win from a given finite position in at most n moves. A naive\nformulation of this problem leads to assertions of high arithmetic complexity\nwith 2n alternating quantifiers---there is a move for white, such that for\nevery black reply, there is a counter-move for white, and so on. In such a\nformulation, the problem does not appear to be decidable; and one cannot expect\nto search an infinitely branching game tree even to finite depth. Nevertheless,\nthe main theorem of this article, confirming a conjecture of the first author\nand C. D. A. Evans, establishes that the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is\ncomputably decidable, uniformly in the position and in n. Furthermore, there is\na computable strategy for optimal play from such mate-in-n positions. The proof\nproceeds by showing that the mate-in-n problem is expressible in what we call\nthe first-order structure of chess, which we prove (in the relevant fragment)\nis an automatic structure, whose theory is therefore decidable. Indeed, it is\ndefinable in Presburger arithmetic. Unfortunately, this resolution of the\nmate-in-n problem does not appear to settle the decidability of the more\ngeneral winning-position problem, the problem of determining whether a\ndesignated player has a winning strategy from a given position, since a\nposition may admit a winning strategy without any bound on the number of moves\nrequired. This issue is connected with transfinite game values in infinite\nchess, and the exact value of the omega one of chess is not known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 18:26:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 14:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 13:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 15:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-17"}

We re-examine this model beyond the bare\nscaling dimension analysis via a 1-loop renormalization group (RG) approach\ncombined with bosonization and re-fermionization techniques near weak-coupling\nand strong-coupling (2CK) fixed points. We find for K -->1 that the 2CK fixed\npoint can be unstable towards the 1CK fixed point and the system may undergo a\nquantum phase transition between 1CK and 2CK fixed points. The QPT in our model\ncomes as a result of the combined Kondo and the helical Luttinger physics in\n2DTI, and it serves as the first example of the 1CK-2CK QPT that is accessible\nby the controlled RG approach. We extract quantum critical and crossover\nbehaviors from various thermodynamical quantities near the transition.

For neutral pores, it\nis shown that with increasing pore size, the theory predicts a transition of\nthe interplate pressure from an attractive to a strongly repulsive regime\nassociated with an ionic packing state, an effect observed in previous Monte\nCarlo simulations for hard core charges. The role of the range of core\ninteractions in the ionic rejection and interplate pressure is thoroughly\nanalyzed. We show that the physics of the system can be split into two\nscreening regimes. The ionic packing effect takes place in the regime of\nmoderately screened core interactions characterized with the bare screening\nparameter of the Yukawa potential b<3/lB, where lB is the Bjerrum length. In\nthe second regime of strongly screened core interactions b>3/lB, solvation\nforces associated with these interactions positively contribute to the ionic\nrejection driven by electrostatic forces and enhance the magnitude of the\nattractive pressure. The pronounced dependence of the interplate pressure and\nionic partition coefficients on the magnitude and the range of core\ninteractions indicates excluded volume effects as an important ion specificity\nand a non-negligible ingredient for the stability of macromolecules in\nelectrolyte solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 20:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We find that the X-ray\nbroad-band energy spectra during these spectral transitions can be adequately\nreproduced by a composition of a low-temperature blackbody component, a\nComptonized component (COMPTB) and Gaussian component. We argue that the\nelectron temperature kT_e of the Compton cloud monotonically increases from 2.3\nkeV to 4.5 keV, when GX~3+1 makes a spectral transition. Using a disk seed\nphoton normalization of COMPTB, which is proportional to mass accretion rate,\nwe find that the photon power-law index Gamma is almost constant (Gamma=2.00+/-\n0.02) when mass accretion rate changes by factor 4. We interpret this\nquasi-stability of the index Gamma and a particular form of the spectrum in the\nframework of a model in which the energy release in the transition layer\nlocated between the accretion disk and neutron star surface dominates that in\nthe disk. Moreover, this index stability effect now established for GX~3+1 was\npreviously found in the atoll source 4U~1728-34 and suggested for a number of\nother LMXB NS binaries (see Farinelli & Titarchuk). This intrinsic behavior of\nneutron stars, in particular for atoll sources, is fundamentally different from\nthat seen in black hole binary sources where the index monotonically increases\nduring spectral transition from the low state to the high state and then\nfinally saturates at high values of mass accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 21:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Three of the four UV excesses can be\ncharacterized by a black body of temperature 5000-13,000K, hotter than expected\nfor the quiescent outer disk. A good fit could not be found for MM Vel. The\nsource of the black-body-like emission is most likely a heated region of the\ninner disk.

The\nChimera scheme is a hybrid method that combines tools from different\napproximation techniques in General Relativity: (i) A multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (the\ngravitational waveforms) and for the local prescription of the self-force; (ii)\na post-Newtonian expansion for the computation of the multipole moments in\nterms of the trajectories; and (iii) a BH perturbation theory expansion when\ntreating the trajectories as a sequence of self-adjusting Kerr geodesics. The\nEMRI trajectory is made out of Kerr geodesic fragments joined via the method of\nosculating elements as dictated by the multipolar post-Minkowskian\nradiation-reaction prescription.

A possible extension is to include superluminal\ntransformations and reference frames. This leads to complex 4D spacetime, or\nreal 8D spacetime M_{4,4}. The mass shell constraint in M_{4,4} becomes, after\nfirst quantization, the ultrahyperbolic Klein-Gordon equation. The Cauchy\nproblem for such equation is not well posed, because it is not possible to\nfreely specify initial data on a 7D hypersurface of M_{4,4}. We explicitly\ndemonstrate that it is possible to do it on a space-like 4-surface for\nbradyons, and on a time-like 4-surface for tachyons. But then the evolution of\na bradyonic field into the four time-like directions, or the \"evolution\" of a\ntachyonic field into the four space-like directions, is not uniquely\ndetermined. We argue that this is perhaps no so bad, because in quantum field\ntheory (after second quantization) the classical trajectories of fields are not\ndetermined anyway, and so it does not matter, if they are not completely\ndetermined already in the first quantized theory.

It is shown\nthat for iceberg systems given by the randomized parameters $a_n(j)$ the\ncomplexity function almost surely satisfies the estimate $p_W(l) >\nl^{3-\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and $l \\ge l_0(\\epsilon)$, and at the\nsame time it is observed that this estimate represents up to a small correction\nthe optimal lower bound for the complexity function, namely, $p_{w_{n+1}}(l_n)\n\\le l_n^3$ along the subsequence $l_n = |w_n|+1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 12:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-30"}

This\nseverely limits the range of molecules that can be detected, because most\nmolecules are purely refractive. Metal nanoparticles or dielectric resonators\ndetect non-absorbing molecules by a resonance shift in response to a local\nperturbation of the refractive index, but neither has reached single-protein\nsensitivity. The most sensitive plasmon sensors to date detect single molecules\nonly when the plasmon shift is amplified by a highly polarizable label or by a\nlocalized precipitation reaction on the particle's surface. Without\namplification, the sensitivity only allows for the statistical detection of\nsingle molecules. Here we demonstrate plasmonic detection of single molecules\nin realtime, without the need for labeling or amplification. We monitor the\nplasmon resonance of a single gold nanorod with a sensitive photothermal assay\nand achieve a ~ 700-fold increase in sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art\nplasmon sensors. We find that the sensitivity of the sensor is intrinsically\nlimited due to spectral diffusion of the SPR. We believe this is the first\noptical technique that detects single molecules purely by their refractive\nindex, without any need for photon absorption by the molecule. The small size,\nbio-compatibility and straightforward surface chemistry of gold nanorods may\nopen the way to the selective and local detection of purely refractive proteins\nin live cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 13:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}

Thus, a\ntiered series of such processes is required to bring gas to the smallest\nscales, each of which on its own may not correlate with the presence of an AGN.\nSimilarly, each may be associated with a starburst event, making it important\nto discriminate between 'circumnuclear' and 'nuclear' star formation.

A pseudodistance between functions is defined such that the condition\nnumber provides an upper bound on how far from a well-conditioned function f a\nperturbed function g can be chosen in order that g is well-conditioned too. For\nboth the local and the global approach an extension of classical Eckart-Young\ndistance theorem is proved, even if only a special class of perturbations is\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 15:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-30"}

It\narises in quantum mechanics'(QM) of a particle in the Riemannian\n$n$-dimensional configurational space obtained by various procedures of\nquantization of the non-relativistic natural Hamilton systems.
