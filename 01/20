The complete data set from this campaign is\npresented, including observations in VHE gamma-rays (H.E.S.S.), X-rays (RXTE,\nCHANDRA, SWIFT XRT), optical (SWIFT UVOT, Bronberg, Watcher, ROTSE), and in the\nradio band (NRT, HartRAO, ATCA). Optical and radio light curves from 2004 to\n2008 are compared to the available VHE data from this period, to put the 2006\ncampaign into the context of the long-term evolution of the source. The X-ray\nand VHE gamma-ray emission are correlated during the observed high state of the\nsource, but show no direct connection with longer wavelengths. The long-term\nflux evolution in the optical and radio bands is found to be correlated and\nshows that the source reaches a high state at long wavelengths after the\noccurrence of the VHE flares. Spectral hardening is seen in the SWIFT XRT data.\nThe nightly averaged high-energy spectra of the non-flaring nights can be\nreproduced by a stationary one-zone SSC model, with only small variations in\nthe parameters. The spectral and flux evolution in the high-energy band during\nthe night of the second VHE flare is modelled with multi-zone SSC models, which\ncan provide relatively simple interpretations for the hour time-scale evolution\nof the high-energy emission, even for such a complex data set. For the first\ntime in this type of source, a clear indication is found for a relation between\nhigh activity at high energies and a long-term increase in the low frequency\nfluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 18:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Because the result has an enormous\nimpact on science, it might be worth double-checking the time definitions with\nrespect to the non-inertial system in which the neutrino travel time was\nmeasured. Potential problems in the OPERA data analysis connected with the\ndefinition of the reference frame and time synchronization are emphasized. We\naim to investigate the synchronization of non-inertial clocks on Earth by\nrelating this time to the proper time of an inertial observer at Solar System\nBarycenter(SSB). The Tempo2 software was used to time-stamp events observed on\nthe geoid with respect to the SSB inertial observer time. Neutrino results from\nOPERA might carry the fingerprint of non-inertial effects. The CERN-Gran Sasso\nclock synchronization is accomplished by applying corrections that depend on\nspecial and general relativistic time dilation effects at the clocks, depending\non the position of the clocks in the solar system gravitational well. As a\nconsequence, TOF distributions are centered on values shorter by tens of ns\nthan expected, integrating over a period from April to December, longer if\notherwise. It is worth remarking that the OPERA runs have always been carried\nout from April/May to November. If the analysis by Tempo2 holds for the OPERA\nexperiment, the excellent measurement by the OPERA collaboration will turn into\na proof of the General Relativity theory in a weak field approximation.

We calculate the temperature distribution of the optically thin\ndust in these inner regions considering the variable impinging radiation from\nboth stars and use the observations to estimate the mass variations in the\nstreams. We find that the SEDs for both epochs can be explained with emission\nfrom an optically thick inner edge of the circumbinary disk and from the\noptically thin streams that connect the circumbinary disk with the two smaller\ncircumstellar disks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that\nthe emission from the optically thin material in the hole, suggested by the\ntheory, is tested against observations of a binary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 20:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

While the high luminosity of the prompt\nemission and standard afterglow behavior are typical of cosmological long GRBs,\nits low energy release, soft spectrum and unusual spectral lag connect this GRB\nto the class of sub-energetic bursts.

Observations of young,\nmassive stars provide evidence that they form in a similar fashion to their\nlow-mass counterparts. The magnetic coupling between a star and its accretion\ndisk may be sufficient to spin down low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars to\nwell below breakup at the end stage of their formation when the accretion rate\nis low. However, we show that these magnetic torques are insufficient to spin\ndown massive PMS stars due to their short formation times and high accretion\nrates. We develop a model for the angular momentum evolution of stars over a\nwide range in mass, considering both magnetic and gravitational torques. We\nfind that magnetic torques are unable to spin down either low or high mass\nstars during the main accretion phase, and that massive stars cannot be spun\ndown significantly by magnetic torques during the end stage of their formation\neither. Spin-down occurs only if massive stars' disk lifetimes are\nsubstantially longer or their magnetic fields are much stronger than current\nobservations suggest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 22:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Using new theoretical evolutionary and\natmospheric models, we have shown that the blue hook stars are very likely the\nprogeny of stars that undergo extensive internal mixing during a late\nhelium-core flash on the white dwarf cooling curve. This \"flash mixing\"\nproduces hotter-than-normal EHB stars with atmospheres significantly enhanced\nin helium and carbon. The larger bolometric correction, combined with the\ndecrease in hydrogen opacity, makes these stars appear subluminous in the\noptical and UV. Flash mixing is more likely to occur in stars born with a high\nhelium abundance, due to their lower mass at the main sequence turnoff. For\nthis reason, the phenomenon is more common in those massive globular clusters\nthat show evidence for secondary populations enhanced in helium. However, a\nhigh helium abundance does not, by itself, explain the presence of blue hook\nstars in massive globular clusters.

Honma et\nal. (2007) (hereafter H2007) claimed that the annual parallax of S269 is\ndetermined within an error of 0.008 milliarcsec (mas), concluding that S269 is\nlocated at 5.3 kpc +- 0.2 kpc from the sun, and R= 13.1 kpc. They claimed that\nthe rotational velocity of S269 is equal to that of the sun within a 3% error.\nThis small error, however, is hardly understood when taking into account the\nresults of other observations and theoretical studies of galactic dynamics. We\nhere reanalyzed the VERA archival data using the self-calibration method\n(hybrid mapping), and found that clusters of maser features of S269 are\ndistributed in much wider area than that investigated in H2007. We confirmed\nthat, if we make a narrow region image without considering the presence of\nmultiple maser spots, and only the phase calibration is applied, we can\nreproduce the same maser structures in H2007. The distribution extent of maser\nspots in the feature differs 0.2 mas from east to west between our results and\nH2007. Moreover, we found that change of relative positions of maser spots in\nthe cluster reaches 0.1 mas or larger between observational epochs. This\nsuggests that if one simply assumes the time-dependent, widely distributed\nmaser sources as a stable single point source, it could cause errors of up to\n0.1 mas in the annual parallax of S269. Taking into account the internal\nmotions of maser spot clusters, the proper motion of S269 cannot be determined\nprecisely. We estimated that the peculiar motion of S269 with respect to a\nGalactic circular rotation is ~20 km/s. These results imply that the observed\nkinematics of maser emissions in S269 cannot give a strong constraint on\ndynamics of the outer part of the Galaxy, in contrast to the claim by H2007.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 09:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Active galactic nuclei (AGN) unification schemes account for a\nvariety of observational differences in terms of viewing geometry. However, we\nfind evidence that strong unification may not hold, and that the immediate\ndusty surroundings of Sy1 and Sy2 nuclei are intrinsically different. The Type\n2 tori studied here are broader, have more clumps, and these clumps have lower\noptical depths than those of Type 1 tori. The larger the covering factor of the\ntorus, the smaller the probability of having direct view of the AGN, and\nvice-versa.

The\nLandau-Placzek ratio, R/B, of the Rayleigh scattering intensity over the total\nBrillouin, was measured thanks to the dynamically controlled stability of the\nused Fabry-Perot interferometer. It was observed that the R/B ratio follows two\nstages as a function of increasing dilution rate: after a strong decrease\nbetween 0.2M and 2.10^-5 M, it increases to reach a maximum between 10^-9 M and\n10^-16 M. The first stage corresponds to the decrease of the Rayleigh\nscattering by the ion concentration fluctuations with the decrease of salt\nconcentration. The second stage, at lower concentrations, is consistent with\nthe increase of the Rayleigh scattering by long-lived sub-microscopic bubbles\nwith the decrease of ion concentration. The origin of these sub-microscopic\nbubbles is the shaking of the solutions which was carried out after each\ncentesimal dilution.

We develop five applications for this\ntechnique. The first one is getting a uniform estimate of stochastic\nconvolution of $\\alpha$-stable processes. Since $\\alpha$-stable noises only\nhave $p<\\alpha$ moment, unlike the stochastic convolution of Wiener process,\nthe well known Da Prato-Kwapie\\'n-Zabczyk's factorization ([5]) is not\napplicable. Alternatively, combining this technique with Doob's martingale\ninequality, we obtain a uniform estimate similar to that of stochastic\nconvolution of Wiener process. Using this estimate, we show that the stochastic\nconvolution of $\\alpha$-stable noises stays, with positive probability, in\narbitrary small ball with zero center. These two results are important for\nstudying ergodicity and regularity of stochastic PDEs forced by $\\alpha$-stable\nnoises ([9]). The third application is getting the same results as in [12]. The\nfourth one gives the trajectory regularity of stochastic Burgers equation\nforced by $\\alpha$-stable noises ([9]).

The magnetic\nfield and the emission gradient orientations, therefore, show some correlation.\nA method is proposed, which -- in the framework of ideal magneto-hydrodynamics\n(MHD) -- connects the measured angle between magnetic field and emission\ngradient orientations to the total field strength. The approach is based on the\nassumption that a change in emission intensity (gradient) is a measure for the\nresulting direction of motion in the MHD force equation. In particular, this\nnew method leads to maps of position-dependent magnetic field strength\nestimates. When evaluating the field curvature and the gravity direction\nlocally on a map, the method can be generalized to arbitrary cloud shapes. The\ntechnique is applied to high-resolution ($\\sim0\\farcs7$) Submillimeter Array\npolarization data of the collapsing core W51 e2. A tentative $\\sim 7.7$~mG\nfield strength is found when averaging over the entire core. The analysis\nfurther reveals some structures and an azimuthally averaged radial profile\n$\\sim r^{-1/2}$ for the field strength. Maximum values close to the center are\naround $19$~mG. The currently available observations lack higher resolution\ndata to probe the innermost part of the core where the largest field strength\nis expected from the method. Application regime and limitations of the method\nare discussed. As a further important outcome of this technique, the local\nsignificance of the magnetic field force compared to the other forces can be\nquantified in a model-independent way, from measured angles only. Finally, the\nmethod can potentially also be expanded and applied to other objects (besides\nmolecular clouds) with measurements that reveal the field morphology, as e.g.\nFaraday rotation measurements in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 11:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The exact process is unknown, as collisions between larger\naggregates tend to lead to fragmentation or bouncing rather than sticking.\nRecent laboratory experiments have however made great progress in the\nunderstanding and mapping of the complex physics involved in dust collisions.\nWe want to study the possibility of planetesimal formation using the results\nfrom the latest laboratory experiments, particularly by including the\nfragmentation with mass transfer effect, which might lead to growth even at\nhigh impact velocities. We present a new experimentally and physically\nmotivated dust collision model capable of predicting the outcome of a collision\nbetween two particles of arbitrary masses and velocities. It is used together\nwith a continuum dust-size evolution code that is both fast in terms of\nexecution time and able to resolve the dust well at all sizes, allowing for all\ntypes of interactions to be studied without biases. We find that for the\ngeneral dust population, bouncing collisions prevent the growth above\nmillimeter-sizes. However, if a small number of cm-sized particles are\nintroduced, for example due to vertical mixing or radial drift, they can act as\na catalyst and start to sweep up the smaller particles. At a distance of 3 AU,\n100-meter-sized bodies are formed on a timescale of 1 Myr. We conclude that\ndirect growth of planetesimals might be a possibility thanks to a combination\nof the existence of a bouncing barrier and the fragmentation with mass transfer\neffect. The bouncing barrier is here even beneficial, as it prevents the growth\nof too many large particles that would otherwise only fragment among each\nother, and creates a reservoir of small particles that can be swept up by\nlarger bodies. However, for this process to work, a few seeds of cm in size or\nlarger have to be introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 13:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We address the source of the\nmost prominent optical aberration, namely coma, and we show that for extended\nsources the off-axis rays have a different focal length from on-axis rays,\nleading to multiple reflections in the guide system. We illustrate how the\ninterplay between coma, sources of finite size, and mirrors with non-perfect\nreflectivity can therefore conspire to produce uneven distributions in the\nneutron beam divergence, the source of complicated resolution functions. To\nsolve these problems, we propose a hybrid elliptic-parabolic guide geometry.\nUsing this new kind of neutron guide shape, it is possible to condition the\nneutron beam and remove almost all of the aberrations, whilst providing the\nsame performance in beam current as a standard elliptic neutron guide.

GNRs of width ranging from\n15 nm to 100 nm have been prepared by e-beam lithographic patterning of\nmechanically exfoliated graphene followed by oxygen plasma etching. Raman\nspectra of narrow GNRs can be characterized by upshifted G band and prominent\ndisorder-related D band originating from scattering at ribbon edges. The D-to-G\nband intensity ratio generally increases with decreasing ribbon width. However,\nits decrease for width < 25 nm, partly attributed to amorphization at the\nedges, provides a valuable experimental estimate on D mode relaxation length of\n<5 nm. The upshift in the G band of the narrowest GNRs can be attributed to\nconfinement effect or chemical doping by functional groups on the GNR edges.\nNotably, GNRs are much more susceptible to photothermal effects resulting in\nreversible hole doping caused by atmospheric oxygen than bulk graphene sheets.\nFinally we show that the 2D band is still a reliable marker in determining the\nnumber of layers of GNRs despite its significant broadening for very narrow\nGNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 14:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-23"}

In the colloidal glass regime, for smooth, non-stick walls, the solid\nnature of the suspension causes a transition in the rheology from\nHerschel-Bulkley (HB) bulk flow behavior at large stress to a Bingham-like slip\nbehavior at low stress, which is suppressed for sufficient colloid-wall\nattraction or colloid-scale wall roughness. Visualization shows how the\nslip-shear transition depends on gap size and the boundary conditions at both\nwalls and that partial slip persist well above the yield stress. A\nphenomenological model, incorporating the Bingham slip law and HB bulk flow,\nfully accounts for the behavior. Microscopically, the Bingham law is related to\na thin (sub-colloidal) lubrication layer at the wall, giving rise to a\ncharacteristic dependence of slip parameters on particle size and\nconcentration. We relate this to the suspension's osmotic pressure and yield\nstress and also analyze the influence of van der Waals interaction. For the\nlargest concentrations, we observe non-uniform flow around the yield stress, in\nline with recent work on bulk shear-banding of concentrated pastes. We also\ndescribe residual slip in concentrated liquid suspensions, where the vanishing\nyield stress causes coexistence of (weak) slip and bulk shear flow for all\nmeasured rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 14:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientations\nreveal a correlation which becomes increasingly more tight with higher\nresolution. The previously developed polarization - intensity gradient method\n(Koch et al. 2012) is applied in order to quantify the magnetic field\nsignificance. This technique provides a way to estimate the local magnetic\nfield force compared to gravity without the need of any mass or field strength\nmeasurements, solely making use of measured angles which reflect the\ngeometrical imprint of the various forces. All three data sets clearly show\nregions with distinct features in the field-to-gravity force ratio. Azimuthally\naveraged radial profiles of this force ratio reveal a transition from a field\ndominance at larger distances to a gravity dominance closer to the emission\npeaks. Normalizing these profiles to a characteristic core scale points toward\nself-similarity. Furthermore, the polarization intensity-gradient method is\nlinked to the mass-to-flux ratio, providing a new approach to estimate the\nlatter one without mass and field strength inputs. A transition from a\nmagnetically supercritical to a subcritical state as a function of distance\nfrom the emission peak is found for the e2 core.

Therefore\nsemi-coherent methods (such as StackSlide) can often achieve a better\nsensitivity. We develop an analytical method for finding optimal StackSlide\nparameters at fixed computing cost under ideal conditions of gapless data with\nGaussian stationary noise. This solution separates two regimes: an unbounded\nregime, where it is always optimal to use all the data, and a bounded regime\nwith a finite optimal observation time. Our analysis of the sensitivity scaling\nreveals that both the fine- and coarse-grid mismatches contribute equally to\nthe average StackSlide mismatch, an effect that had been overlooked in previous\nstudies.

DFT obtains a spin polarization of the occupied Dirac cone states of\n80-90%, which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data after\ncareful background subtraction. Furthermore, we observe a strongly spin-orbit\nsplit surface band at lower energy. This state is found at 0.8eV below the\nFermi level at the gamma-point, disperses upwards, and disappears at about\n0.4eV below the Fermi level into two different bulk bands. Along the gamma-K\ndirection, the band is located within a spin-orbit gap.
