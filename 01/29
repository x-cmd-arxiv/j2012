A method for estimating the errors which affect intermediate and\nfinal results is proposed and a summary of many software simulations is\ndiscussed. The basic idea consists of representing FP numbers by means of a\ndata structure collecting value and estimated error information. Under certain\nconstraints, the estimate of the absolute error is accurate and has a compact\nstatistical distribution. By monitoring the estimated relative error during a\ncomputation (an ad-hoc definition of relative error has been used), the\nvalidity of results can be ensured. The error estimate enables the\nimplementation of robust algorithms, and the detection of ill-conditioned\nproblems. A dynamic extension of number precision, under the control of error\nestimates, is advocated, in order to compute results within given error bounds.\nA reduced time penalty could be achieved by a specialized FP processor. The\nrealization of a hardwired processor incorporating the method, with current\ntechnology, should not be anymore a problem and would make the practical\nadoption of the method feasible for most applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 17:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

An interesting question is whether analogous algebras exist\nwhen a complete valued field other than the complex numbers is used as the\nunderlying field of the algebra. In the Archimedean setting, this\ngeneralisation is given by the theory of real function algebras introduced by\nS. H. Kulkarni and B. V. Limaye in the 1980s. This thesis establishes a broader\ntheory accommodating any complete valued field as the underlying field by\ninvolving Galois automorphisms and using non-Archimedean analysis. The approach\ntaken keeps close to the original definitions from the Archimedean setting.\nBasic function algebras are defined and generalise real function algebras to\nall complete valued fields. Several examples are provided. Each basic function\nalgebra is shown to have a lattice of basic extensions related to the field\nstructure. In the non-Archimedean setting it is shown that certain basic\nfunction algebras have residue algebras that are also basic function algebras.\nA representation theorem is established. Commutative unital Banach F-algebras\nwith square preserving norm and finite basic dimension are shown to be\nisometrically F-isomorphic to some subalgebra of a Basic function algebra. The\ntheory of non-commutative real function algebras was established by K. Jarosz\nin 2008. The possibility of their generalisation to the non-Archimedean setting\nis established in this thesis. In the context of complex uniform algebras, a\nnew proof is given using transfinite induction of the Feinstein-Heath Swiss\ncheese \"Classicalisation\" theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2012 20:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

We present positions and velocities for 796 planetary nebulae (PNe) in\nthe Fornax Brightest Cluster Galaxy NGC 1316 (Fornax A).

Using FORS2 on the VLT, the PN\nvelocities were measured using a counter-dispersed slitless-spectroscopy\ntechnique that produced the largest-to-date sample outside of the Local Group.\nSpherical, non-rotating, constant-anisotropy Jeans models were con- strained by\nobservations of the planetary nebulae and existing integrated light spectra.\nResults.

The problem that we address is that\nDNA-functionalised colloids typically crystallize in a narrow temperature\nwindow, if at all. The underlying reason is the extreme sensitivity of\nDNA-mediated interactions to temperature or other physical control parameters.\nWe propose to widen the window for colloidal crystallization by exploiting the\ncompetition between DNA linkages with different nucleotide sequences, which\nresults in a temperature-dependent switching of the dominant bond type.\nFollowing such a strategy, we can decrease the temperature dependence of\nDNA-mediated self assembly to make systems that can crystallize in a wider\ntemperature window than is possible with existing systems of DNA functionalised\ncolloids. We report Monte Carlo simulations that show that the proposed\nstrategy can indeed work in practice for real systems and specific, designable\nDNA sequences. Depending on the length ratio of the different DNA constructs,\nwe find that the bond switching is either energetically driven (equal length or\n`symmetric' DNA) or controlled by a combinatorial entropy gain (`asymmetric'\nDNA), which results from the large number of possible binding partners for each\nDNA strand.

When combined together, the global p-value of the localized\nexcesses detected in the two channels is found equal to either 0.033 or 0.013,\ncorresponding, respectively, to a significance of 1.8 sigma and 2.2 sigma\ndepending upon the assumption of mutual independence or dependence of the\namplitudes of the expected signal in each channel. Among the other obtained\nresults, the local and global significances of the two channels individually\ntaken are computed in good agreement with those reported by the Collaboration,\nwhile only a minor discrepancy is found for their combined local significance.\nFinally, some considerations are illustrated related to the low statistics four\nlepton decay channel, showing that a search strategy different from the profile\nlikelihood method, e.g. scan statistics, can result in a substantially\ndifferent significance, enhanced to a 3.3 sigma global effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2012 14:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

Mori's projection operator technique is used as a\nmethod, which retains the rotation symmetry of spin components and does not\nanticipate any magnetic ordering. For zero temperature several phase\ntransitions are observed. At $p\\approx 0.2$ the ground state is transformed\nfrom the ferromagnetic spin structure into a disordered state, which in its\nturn is changed to an antiferromagnetic long-range ordered state with the\nincommensurate ordering vector ${\\bf Q = Q^\\prime} \\approx (1.16, 0)$ at\n$p\\approx 0.31$. With the further growth of $p$ the ordering vector moves along\nthe line ${\\bf Q^\\prime-Q_c}$ to the commensurate point ${\\bf\nQ_c}=(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}, 0)$, which is reached at $p = 1$. The final state with an\nantiferromagnetic long-range order can be conceived as four interpenetrating\nsublattices with the $120^\\circ$ spin structure on each of them.

The model is generally solved using a numerical\ntechnique such as the finite element model. Conversely, one may be interested\nin the loads that have resulted in a given state of bone. This is the inverse\nof the former problem. Even though the inverse problem has several\napplications, it has not received as much attention as the forward problem,\npartly because solving the inverse problem is more difficult. A nonlinear\nsystem identification technique is needed for solving the inverse problem. In\nthis study, we use artificial neural networks for prediction of tissue\nadaptation loads from a given density distribution of trabecular bone. It is\nshown that the proposed method can successfully identify the loading parameters\nfrom the density distribution of the tissue. Two important challenges for all\nload prediction algorithms are the non-uniqueness of the solution of the\ninverse problem and the inaccuracies in the measurement of the morphology of\nthe tissue. Both challenges are studied, and it is shown that the load\nprediction technique proposed in this paper can overcome both.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2012 15:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}
