This is especially true for\nchaotic systems, where a small change in the initial conditions may cause a\ndramatic shift in the trajectories. The second one is Turing-completeness. By\nthe undecidability of the Halting Problem, the long-term prospects of a system\nthat can simulate a Turing Machine cannot be determined computationally.\n  We investigate the interplay between these two forces -- unaccounted-for\nerrors and Turing-completeness.

Inflationary parameters are related to the Majorana and Dirac\ncouplings responsible for neutrino masses with the scale of inflation set by a\nright-handed neutrino mass $M_{\\nu^c} \\sim 10^6-10^{12}$ GeV. Tuning of the\nneutrino Dirac and Majorana superpotential couplings and soft Susy breaking\nparameters is required to enforce flatness of the inflationary potential. In\ncontrast to previous inflection point inflation models the cubic term is\ndominantly derived from superpotential couplings rather than soft A-terms. Thus\nsince $M_{\\nu^c}>>M_{Susy}$ the tuning condition is almost independent of the\nsoft supersymmetry breaking parameters and therefore more stable. The required\nfine tuning is also less stringent than for Minimal SUSY Standard Model (MSSM)\ninflation or Dirac neutrino 'A-term\" inflation scenarios due to the much larger\nvalue of the inflaton mass. Reheating proceeds via `instant preheating' which\nrapidly dumps all the inflaton energy into a MSSM mode radiation bath giving a\nhigh reheat temperature $T_{rh} \\approx M_{\\nu^c}^{3/4}\\, 10^{6}$ GeV $\\sim\n10^{11}- 10^{15} $ GeV.\n  Thus our scenario requires large gravitino mass $> 50 $ TeV to avoid a\ngravitino problem.

This coupling is\npossible because the representation category of A(4) is a module category over\nthe representation categories used to construct the EPRL model. The vertex\noperators which interchange vacua in the resulting quantum field theory\nreproduce the bosons and fermions of the standard model, up to issues of\nsymmetry breaking which we do not resolve. We are led to the hypothesis that\nphysical particles in nature represent vacuum changing operators on a sea of\ninvisible excitations which are only observable in the A(4) representation\nlabels which govern the horizontal symmetry revealed in neutrino oscillations.\nThe quantum field theory of the A(4) representations is just the dual model on\nthe extended lattice of the Lie group $E_6$, as explained by the quantum Mckay\ncorrespondence of Frenkel Jing and Wang.

We found two\ntuning parameters that could take the system to a critical point where a simple\npower-law described the avalanche size distribution as predicted by\nself-organized criticality, which proposed that complex dynamical systems\nself-organize to a critical point without need for tuning. Our distributions\nwere well described by a simple power-law with the power {\\tau} = 1.5 when\ndropping beads slowly onto the apex of a bead pile from a small height.\nHowever, we could also move the system from the critical point using either of\ntwo tuning parameters: the height from which the beads fell onto the top of the\npile or the region over which the beads struck the pile. As the drop height\nincreased, the system did not reach the critical point yet the resulting\ndistributions were independent of the bead mass, coefficient of friction, or\ncoefficient of restitution.

But the inclusion of Ia SNe in the total energy input (E_SN)\ngives an even tighter correlation, which may be characterized with a linear\nrelation, Lx=0.5%E_SN, and with a dispersion of 0.45dex. Moreover, the coronal\nradiation efficiency (\\eta=Lx/E_SN) shows little correlation with either the\nstellar mass or the gravitational mass (M_TF, inferred from the rotation\nvelocity), but is significantly correlated with their ratio (M_TF/M_*), which\nmay be expressed as a linear scaling relation \\eta=0.35%M_TF/M_* for the entire\nranges of galaxy parameters. This joint scaling relation suggests that the\ncoronae are self-regulated by the combination of gravitational confinement and\nfeedback. But SN appears to be the primary heating source, because about half\nof our galaxies are not massive enough to allow for the accretion to play a\nmajor role.

A t-step\nrandom walk (v_1,...,v_t) on M starting from the stationary distribution pi has\nexpected total weight E[X] = mu t, where X = sum_{i=1}^t f(v_i). Let T be the\nL_1 mixing-time of M. We show that the probability of X deviating from its mean\nby a multiplicative factor of delta, i.e., Pr [ |X - mu t| >= delta mu t ], is\nat most exp(-Omega(delta^2 mu t / T)) for 0 <= delta <= 1, and exp(-Omega(delta\nmu t / T)) for delta > 1. In fact, the bounds hold even if the weight functions\nf_i's for i in [t] are distinct, provided that all of them have the same mean\nmu.\n  We also obtain a simplified proof for the Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds based on\nthe spectral expansion lambda of M, which is the square root of the second\nlargest eigenvalue (in absolute value) of M tilde{M}, where tilde{M} is the\ntime-reversal Markov chain of M. We show that the probability Pr [ |X - mu t|\n>= delta mu t ] is at most exp(-Omega(delta^2 (1-lambda) mu t)) for 0 <= delta\n<= 1, and exp(-Omega(delta (1-lambda) mu t)) for delta > 1.\n  Both of our results extend to continuous-time Markov chains, and to the case\nwhere the walk starts from an arbitrary distribution x, at a price of a\nmultiplicative factor depending on the distribution x in the concentration\nbounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 01:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2012 13:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

This paper\naddressed to the problem of approach to the thermal equilibrium in an isolated\nmacroscopic quantum system, which was studied on the example of the quantum\nchain of weakly interacting harmonic oscillators. In the initial state,\nmacroscopic energy was supplied to one oscillator (atom) in the chain.\nSubsequent evolution of the quantum state of the whole chain was determined due\nto the model integrability. The main subject of interest was the time evolution\nof the reduced density operators characterizing the quantum state of a\nparticular atom. On the short time-scale, the energy perturbation expands along\nthe chain with the velocity of the fastest phonon mode. On the long-time scale,\nthe single-atom density operators display strong fluctuations around the\ncanonical Gibbs distribution. These fluctuations are caused by the degeneracy\nof the energy level differences (presence of resonances) in the model of\ncoupled harmonic oscillators. After lifting this degeneracy, fluctuations are\nsuppressed providing, that the reduced density operator of each atom in the\nchain becomes very close to the Gibbs distribution at almost any time moment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 05:55:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 05:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-30"}

A nonlinear\ntransformation also modifies the redshift space distortions in the same limit,\ngiving rise to a velocity bias. In models with primordial nongaussianity a\nnonlinear transformation generates a scale dependent bias on large scales. We\nderive analytic expressions for these for a general nonlinear transformation.\nThese biases can be expressed entirely in terms of the one point distribution\nfunction (PDF) of the final field and the parameters of the transformation. Our\nanalysis allows one to devise nonlinear transformations with nearly arbitrary\nbias properties, which can be used to increase the signal in the large scale\nclustering limit. We apply the results to the ionizing equilibrium model of\nLyman-alpha forest, in which Lyman-alpha flux F is related to the density\nperturbation delta via a nonlinear transformation. Velocity bias can be\nexpressed as an average over the Lyman-alpha flux PDF. At z=2.4 we predict the\nvelocity bias of -0.1, compared to the observed value of -0.13 +/- 0.03. Bias\nand primordial nongaussianity bias depend on the parameters of the\ntransformation. Measurements of bias can thus be used to constrain these\nparameters, and for reasonable values of the ionizing background intensity we\ncan match the predictions to observations. Matching to the observed values we\npredict the ratio of primordial nongaussianity bias to bias to have the\nopposite sign and lower magnitude than the corresponding values for the highly\nbiased galaxies, but this depends on the model parameters and can also vanish\nor change the sign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 09:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The classical decoding system for\ngenerating virtual views first projects a reference or encoded frame to a given\nviewpoint and then fills in the holes due to potential occlusions. This last\nstep still constitutes a complex operation with specific software or hardware\nat the receiver and requires a certain quantity of information from the\nneighboring frames for insuring consistency between the virtual images. In this\nwork we propose a new approach that shifts most of the burden due to\ninteractivity from the decoder to the encoder, by anticipating the navigation\nof the decoder and sending auxiliary information that guarantees temporal and\ninterview consistency. This leads to an additional cost in terms of\ntransmission rate and storage, which we minimize by using optimization\ntechniques based on the user behavior modeling.

We also discuss on the\nspectrum of fluctuations that arise in soft-wall models and we present a\nconcrete model where a large UV/IR hierarchy can be generated without any\nfine-tuning.\n  Next, we consider a two-brane setup to study how the electroweak symmetry can\nbe broken in warped models with generalized metrics when the Higgs boson\npropagates in the bulk. We show how the bounds on the Kaluza-Klein (KK) scale\nthat arise from electroweak precision observables can be alleviated when the\nHiggs is localized towards the infrared brane. We apply our results to a\nminimal 5D extension of the SM and consider the AdS geometry and a deformation\nof it inspired by soft-walls.

The temporal and spectral properties of the\npulsar in a wide energy band (0.6-120 keV) were studied for the first time. We\ndiscovered a ~32 keV cyclotron resonant scattering feature in the source\nspectrum, that allowed us to estimate the magnetic field strength of the\nneutron star as B~3.2 x 10^12 G. The estimate of the magnetic field strength\nwas confirmed by a comprehensive analysis of the noise power spectrum of the\nsource.

Each filament is driven by a rotary motor and a very flexible\nhook transmits the motor torque to the filament. We model it by discretizing\nKirchhoff's elastic-rod theory and develop a coarse-grained approach for\ndriving the helical filament by a motor torque. A rotating flagellum generates\na thrust force, which pushes the cell body forward and which increases with the\nmotor torque. We fix the rotating flagellum in space and show that it buckles\nunder the thrust force at a critical motor torque. Buckling becomes visible as\na supercritical Hopf bifurcation in the thrust force. A second buckling\ntransition occurs at an even higher motor torque. We attach the flagellum to a\nspherical cell body and also observe the first buckling transition during\nlocomotion. By changing the size of the cell body, we vary the necessary thrust\nforce and thereby obtain a characteristic relation between the critical thrust\nforce and motor torque. We present a sophisticated analytical model for the\nbuckling transition based on a helical rod which quantitatively reproduces the\ncritical force-torque relation. Real values for motor torque, cell body size,\nand the geometry of the helical filament suggest that buckling should occur in\nsingle bacterial flagella. We also find that the orientation of pulling\nflagella along the driving torque is not stable and comment on the biological\nrelevance for marine bacteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 13:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

The construction indicates that it could be equivalent to\nmassless QCD. The case in which only quark condensate effects are retained is\ndiscussed in more detail. Then, the appearing auxiliary fermion fields can be\nintegrated leading to a theory with the action of massless QCD, to which one\nlocal and gauge invariant Lagrangian term for each quark flavour is added.\nThese terms are defined by two gluon and two quark fields, in a form curiously\nnot harming power counting renormalizability. The gluon self-energy is\nevaluated in second order in the gauge coupling and all orders in the new quark\ncouplings, and the result became transversal as required by the gauge\ninvariance. The vacuum energy was calculated in the two loop approximation and\nalso became gauge parameter independent. The possibilities that higher loop\ncontributions to the vacuum energy allow the generation of a quark mass\nhierarchy as a flavour symmetry breaking effect are discussed. However, the\ndecision on this issue needs the evaluation of more than two loop\ncontributions, in which more than one type of quark loops start appearing,\npossibly leading to interference effects in the vacuum energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 15:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-16"}

The outflow energy is processed into copious e+- until the plasma enters\nouter parts of the loop where the magnetic field is reduced below 10^13 G. In\nthe outer zone, photons scattered by the outflow do not convert to e+- pairs\nand the outflow radiates its energy away. The escaping radiation forms a\ndistinct hard X-ray peak in the magnetar spectrum. It has the following\nfeatures: (1) Its luminosity L=10^35-10^36 erg/s can easily exceed the thermal\nluminosity from the magnetar surface.

Long-term stability, on the other hand, depends mainly on the\nproperties of the potential, and in particular, on whether it admits a\nsubstantial fraction of strongly chaotic orbits. We show that in the case of a\nweak density cusp (gamma=1 Dehnen model) the N-body model is remarkably stable,\nwhile the strong-cusp (gamma=2) model exhibits substantial evolution of shape\naway from triaxiality, which we attribute to the effect of chaotic diffusion of\norbits. The different behaviour of these two cases originates from the\ndifferent phase space structure of the potential; in the weak-cusp case there\nexist numerous resonant orbit families that impede chaotic diffusion. We also\nfind that it is hardly possible to affect the rate of this evolution by\naltering the fraction of chaotic orbits in the Schwarzschild model, which is\nexplained by the fact that the chaotic properties of an orbit are not preserved\nby the N-body evolution.

We describe a prototype device using this\n\"side-collection\" technique, which provides a photon collection efficiency of\napproximately 47% and a photon detection efficiency of approximately 39%. We\napply the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio gained from side-collection to AC\nmagnetometry using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers, and\ndemonstrate an AC magnetic field sensitivity of 100 pT/\\sqrt{Hz}, limited by\nadded noise in the prototype side-collection device.

Because\nof this, knowledge creation, exchange and its subsequent transformation into\ninnovations for improved welfare and economic growth is briefly described from\na historical point of view. Next, three approaches are discussed for modeling\nthe diffusion of ideas in the areas of science and technology, through (i)\ndeterministic, (ii) stochastic, and (iii) statistical approaches. These are\nillustrated through their corresponding population dynamics and epidemic models\nrelative to the spreading of ideas, knowledge and innovations. The\ndeterministic dynamical models are considered to be appropriate for analyzing\nthe evolution of large and small societal, scientific and technological systems\nwhen the influence of fluctuations is insignificant. Stochastic models are\nappropriate when the system of interest is small but when the fluctuations\nbecome significant for its evolution. Finally statistical approaches and models\nbased on the laws and distributions of Lotka, Bradford, Yule, Zipf-Mandelbrot,\nand others, provide much useful information for the analysis of the evolution\nof systems in which development is closely connected to the process of idea\ndiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 15:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-31"}

Supported by Monte Carlo simulations, our goal is in particular to\nprovide an analytical picture of the mechanisms involved. The models under\nconsiderations exhibit Coulomb phases in two and three dimensions, where the\nitinerant electrons are coupled to the localized spins via double exchange\ninteractions. Because of the Hund coupling, magnetic loops naturally emerge\nfrom the Coulomb phase and serve as conducting channels for the mobile\nelectrons, leading to doping-dependent rearrangements of the loop ensemble in\norder to minimize the electronic kinetic energy. At low electron density \\rho,\nthe double exchange coupling mainly tends to segment the very long loops\nwinding around the system into smaller ones while it gradually lifts the\nextensive degeneracy of the Coulomb phase with increasing \\rho. For higher\ndoping, the results are strongly lattice dependent, displaying loop crystals\nwith a given loop length for some specific values of \\rho, which can melt into\nanother loop crystal by varying \\rho. Finally, we contrast this to the\nqualitatively different behavior of analogous models on kagome or triangular\nlattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 15:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
