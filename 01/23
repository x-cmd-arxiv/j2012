Specifically, we present a direct Bellantoni-Cook-style normal/safe\ntyped programming formalism, RS1, that expresses feasible structural recursions\nand corecursions over data and codata specified by polynomial functors. (Lists,\nstreams, finite trees, infinite trees, etc. are all directly definable.) A\nnovel aspect of RS1 is that it embraces structure-sharing as in standard\nfunctional-programming implementations. As our data representations use\nsharing, our implementation of structural recursions are memoized to avoid the\npossibly exponentially-many repeated subcomputations a naive implementation\nmight perform. We introduce notions of size for representations of data\n(accounting for sharing) and codata (using ideas from type-2 computational\ncomplexity) and establish that type-level 1 RS1-functions have\npolynomial-bounded runtimes and satisfy a polynomial-time completeness\ncondition. Also, restricting RS1 terms to particular types produces\ncharacterizations of some standard complexity classes (e.g., omega-regular\nlanguages, linear-space functions) and some less-standard classes (e.g.,\nlog-space streams).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2012 16:06:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 22:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-31"}

The\nlattice can be created as an optical or magnetic one, by means of available\nexperimental techniques. The objective is to identify stable 3D solitons\nsupported by the setting. Two methods are developed for this purpose: The\nvariational approximation, formulated in the framework of the 3D\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, and the 1D nonpolynomial Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\n(NPSE) in the axial direction, which allows one to predict the collapse in the\nframework of the 1D description.

Unlike\ntheir counterparts supported by the NL in the 1D model with the cubic\nnonlinearity, kicked solitons of the NPSE cannot be set in motion, but the kick\nmay help to stabilize them against the collapse, by causing the solitons to\nshed excess norm.

In particular, this implies that the first component $(X_t)_{t\\in T}$\nis also a Markov process. Markov random walks or additive functionals of a\nMarkov process are special instances of Markov additive processes.

This result relies on the assumption that the\namplitude of the optical component's measured radial velocity curve is not\nseriously affected by the interactions in the system. In this paper we explore\nthe effect on the radial velocity curve caused by surface motions excited by\ntidal interactions. We use a calculation from first principles that involves\nsolving the equations of motion of a Lagrangian grid of surface elements. The\nvelocities on the visible surface of the star are projected along the\nline-of-sight to the observer to obtain the absorption-line profile in the\nobserver's reference frame. The centroid of the line-profiles for different\norbital phases is then measured and a simulated RV curve constructed. Models\nare run for the \"standard\" (vsini=116 km/s) and \"slow\" (56 km/s) supergiant\nrotation velocities. We find that the surface velocity field is complex and\nincludes fast, small-spatial scale structures. It leads to strong variability\nin the photospheric line profiles which, in turn, causes significant deviations\nfrom a Keplerian RV curve. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of model RV curves are\nin all cases larger than the amplitude of the orbital motion. Keplerian fits to\nRV curves obtained with the \"standard\" rotation velocity imply a neutron star\n>1.7 Mo. However, a similar analysis of the \"slow\" rotational velocity models\nallows for m_ns ~ 1.5 Mo. Thus, the stellar rotation plays an important role in\ndetermining the characteristics of the perturbed RV curve. Given the\nobservational uncertainty in GP Vel's projected rotation velocity and the\nstrong perturbations seen in the published and the model RV curves, we are\nunable to rule out a small (~1.5 Mo) mass for the neutron star companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 01:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We start with the classical case where the probability of having\n$\\Gamma$, as well as the a priori probability of being the criminal, is the\nsame for all individuals. We then generalize the solution to deal with\nheterogeneous populations, biased search procedures for the suspect,\n$\\Gamma$-correlations, uncertainty about the subpopulation of the criminal and\nthe suspect, and uncertainty about the $\\Gamma$-frequencies.

Unstable\nthermal modes due to unbalance between radiative losses and heating can lead to\nrapid plasma cooling and condensation. An accurate description of the radiative\nloss function is therefore crucial for this process. Aims: We study the\nstability of thermal modes in unbounded and uniform plasmas with properties\nakin to those in solar prominences. Effects due to partial ionization are taken\ninto account. Three different parametrizations of the radiative loss function\nare used. Methods: By means of a normal mode analysis, we investigate linear\nnonadiabatic perturbations superimposed on the equilibrium state. We find an\napproximate instability criterion for thermal modes, while the exact linear\ngrowth rate is obtained by numerically solving the general dispersion relation.\nThe stability of thermal disturbances is compared for the three different loss\nfunctions considered. Results: Using up-to-date computations of radiative\nlosses derived from the CHIANTI atomic database, we find that thermal modes may\nbe unstable in prominences for lower temperatures than those predicted with\npreviously existing loss functions. Thermal instability can take place for\ntemperatures as low as 15,000 K, approximately. The obtained linear growth\nrates indicate that this instability might have an important impact on the\ndynamics and evolution of cool prominence condensations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 10:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

If the gamma\nrays are produced mainly by hadronic processes rather than leptonic processes\nlike bremsstrahlung, then the flux of energetic cosmic ray (CR) nuclei (>1 GeV)\nrequired to produce the gamma rays can be inferred at the site where the\nparticles are accelerated in SNR shocks. It is of great interest to understand\nthe acceleration of the CR of lower energy (<1 GeV) accompanying the energetic\ncomponent. These particles of lower energy are most effective in ionizing\ninterstellar gas, leaving an observable imprint on the interstellar ion\nchemistry. A correlation of energetic gamma radiation with enhanced\ninterstellar ionization can thus support the hadronic origin of the gamma rays\nand constrain the acceleration of ionizing CR in SNR. We propose a method to\ntest the hadronic origin of GeV gamma rays from SNR associated with a molecular\ncloud. We use observational gamma ray data for each of these SNR known,\nmodeling the observations to obtain the underlying proton spectrum assuming\nthat the gamma rays are produced by pion decay. Assuming that the acceleration\nmechanism does not only produce high energy protons, but also low energy\nprotons, this proton spectrum at the source is then used to calculate the\nionization rate of the molecular cloud. Ionized molecular hydrogen triggers a\nchemical network forming molecular ions. The relaxation of these ions results\nin characteristic line emission, which can be predicted. We show that the\nionization rate for at least two objects is more than an order of magnitude\nabove Galactic average for molecular clouds, hinting at an enhanced formation\nrate of molecular ions.

Effects of\nGalactic turbulence on the temperature fluctuations are discussed in this\ncontent. It is also shown that the one-third subharmonic resonance can be\nconsidered as a background for the 11-years solar cycle, and again the global\n(solar) rotation and chaotic propagating waves play significant role in this\nphenomenon. Finally, a multidecadal chaotic coherence between the detrended\nsolar activity and global temperature has been briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 10:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}

The microscopic theory can be formulated without having to appeal to any\nparticular space-time metric and only assumes the pre-existence of a manifold\nendowed with an affine connection. We emphasize that not even a flat metric\nneeds to be assumed; in this sense the microscopic theory is quasi-topological.\nThe vierbein appears as a condensate of the fundamental fermions. In spite of\nhaving non-standard characteristics, the microscopic theory appears to be\nrenormalizable. The effective long-distance theory is obtained perturbatively\naround a vacuum that, if the background affine connection is set to zero, is\n(euclidean) de Sitter space-time. If perturbatively small connections are\nintroduced on this background, fluctuations of the metric (i.e. gravitons)\nappear; they are described by an effective theory at long distances whose more\nrelevant operators correspond to the Einstein-Hilbert action with a\ncosmological constant. This effective action is derived in the large N limit, N\nbeing the number of fermion species in the fundamental theory.
