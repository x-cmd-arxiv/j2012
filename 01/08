Each agent has an independent opinion (among an arbitrary, but\nfixed, number of choices) and its own degree of conviction. The latter changes\nevery time it interacts with another agent who has a different opinion. The\ndynamics leads to size distributions of clusters (made up of agents which have\nthe same opinion and are located at contiguous spatial positions) which follow\na power law, as long as the range of the interaction between the agents is not\ntoo short, i.e. the system self-organizes into a critical state. Short range\ninteractions lead to an exponential cut off in the size distribution and to\nspatial correlations which cause agents which have the same opinion to be\nclosely grouped. When the diversity of opinions is restricted to two,\nnon-consensus dynamic is observed, with unequal population fractions, whereas\nconsensus is reached if the agents are also allowed to interact with those\nwhich are located far from them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2012 16:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-29"}

Regardless of their\nformation mechanism, a key evolution issue is the efficiency of their retention\nnear their host stars. If these planets attained their present-day orbits\nduring or shortly after the T Tauri phase of their host stars, a large fraction\nwould have encountered intense stellar magnetic field. Since these planets have\na higher conductivity than the atmosphere of their stars, the magnetic flux\ntube connecting the planet and host star would slip though the envelope of the\nstar faster than across the planet. The induced electro-motive force across the\nplanet's diameter leads to a potential drop which propagates along a flux tube\naway from the planet with an Alfven speed. The foot of the flux tube sweeps\nacross the stellar surface and the potential drop drives a DC current analogous\nto that proposed for the Io-Jupiter electrodynamic interaction. The ohmic\ndissipation of this current produces potentially observable hot spots in the\nstar envelope. The current heats the planet and leads to a Lorrentz torque\nwhich drives the planet's orbit to evolve toward circularization and\nsynchronization with the star's spin. The net effect is the damping of the\nplanet's orbital eccentricity. Around slowly (rapidly) spinning stars, this\nprocess also causes rocky planets with periods less than a few days to undergo\norbital decay (expansion/stagnation) within a few Myr. In principle, this\neffect can determine the retention efficiency of short-period hot Earths. We\nalso estimate the ohmic dissipation in these planets and show that it can lead\nto severe structure evolution and potential loss of volatile material.

Using methods\nsimilar to those used to study four-dimensional CDT we show that there exists a\n$c=1$ \"barrier\", analogous to the $c=1$ barrier encountered in non-critical\nstring theory, only the CDT transition is easier to be detected numerically.\nFor $d\\leq 1$ we observe time-translation invariance and geometries entirely\ngoverned by quantum fluctuations around the uniform toroidal topology put in by\nhand. For $d>1$ the effective average geometry is no longer toroidal but\n\"semiclassical\" and spherical with Hausdorff dimension $d_H = 3$. In the $d>1$\nsector we study the time dependence of the semiclassical spatial volume\ndistribution and show that the observed behavior is described an effective\nmini-superspace action analogous to the actions found in the de Sitter phase of\nthree- and four-dimensional pure CDT simulations and in the three-dimensional\nCDT-like Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2012 23:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Warming ceases only once the surface reaches ~1400K\nand emits radiation in the near-infrared, where water is not a good greenhouse\ngas. This would evaporate the entire ocean and exterminate all planetary life.\nVenus experienced a runaway greenhouse in the past, and we expect that Earth\nwill in around 2 billion years as solar luminosity increases. But could we\nbring on such a catastrophe prematurely, by our current climate-altering\nactivities? Here we review what is known about the runaway greenhouse to answer\nthis question, describing the various limits on outgoing radiation and how\nclimate will evolve between these. The good news is that almost all lines of\nevidence lead us to believe that is unlikely to be possible, even in principle,\nto trigger full a runaway greenhouse by addition of non-condensible greenhouse\ngases such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. However, our understanding of\nthe dynamics, thermodynamics, radiative transfer and cloud physics of hot and\nsteamy atmospheres is weak. We cannot therefore completely rule out the\npossibility that human actions might cause a transition, if not to full\nrunaway, then at least to a much warmer climate state than the present one.\nHigh climate sensitivity might provide a warning. If we, or more likely our\nremote descendants, are threatened with a runaway greenhouse then\ngeoengineering to reflect sunlight might be life's only hope. ...[2 sentences\ncut to meet arXiv char limit]...

Retardation effect has to be considered in accordance with\nLi\\'{e}nard-Wiechert (or retarded) potential of a moving charge or the\nrelativistic electrodynamics.

The motivation for this is that CE\nsignals facilitate the use of power-efficient RF power amplifiers. Analytical\nand numerical results show that, under certain mild conditions on the channel\ngains, for a fixed $M$, array gain is achievable even under the stringent\nper-antenna CE constraint (essentially, for a fixed $M$, at sufficiently large\n$N$ the total transmitted power can be reduced with increasing $N$ while\nmaintaining a fixed information rate to each user). Simulations for the i.i.d.\nRayleigh fading channel show that the total transmit power can be reduced\nlinearly with increasing $N$ (i.e., an O(N) array gain). We also propose a\nprecoding scheme which finds near-optimal CE signals to be transmitted, and has\nO(MN) complexity. Also, in terms of the total transmit power required to\nachieve a fixed desired information sum-rate, despite the stringent per-antenna\nCE constraint, the proposed CE precoding scheme performs close to the\nsum-capacity achieving scheme for an average-only total transmit power\nconstrained channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2012 15:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 17:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-14"}
