The advent of high-performance computing either via multicore\nprocessors or distributed processors emphasizes the possibility for exhaustive\nsearch by multiple search agents. Here we analyse the performance of exhaustive\nsearch when it is conducted by multiple search agents. Several strategies for\ncooperation between the search agents are evaluated.

We present a new\nanalytical filter, the Biparametric Adaptive Filter (BAF), that is able to\nadapt itself to the statistical properties of the background as well as to the\nprofile of the compact sources, maximizing the amplification and improving the\ndetection process. We have tested the performance of this filter using\nrealistic simulations of the microwave sky between 30 and 857 GHz as observed\nby the Planck satellite, where complex backgrounds can be found. We demonstrate\nthat doing a local analysis on flat patches allows one to find a combination of\nthe optimal scale of the filter R and the index of the filter g that will\nproduce a global maximum in the amplification, enhancing the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of the detected sources in the filtered map and improving the total\nnumber of detections above a threshold. We conclude that the new filter is able\nto improve the overall performance of the MHW2, increasing the SNR of the\ndetections and, therefore, the number of detections above a 5 sigma threshold.\nThe improvement of the new filter in terms of SNR is particularly important in\nthe vicinity of the galactic plane and in the presence of strong galactic\nemission. Finally, we compare the sources detected by each method and find that\nthe new filter is able to detect more new sources than the MHW2 at all\nfrequencies and in clean regions of the sky. The BAF is also less affected by\nspurious detections, associated to compact structures in the vicinity of the\ngalactic plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2012 17:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The adaptive nuclear\nnorm of a matrix is defined as the weighted sum of the singular values of the\nmatrix. For example, the pre-specified weights may be some negative power of\nthe singular values of the data matrix (or its projection in regression\nsetting). The adaptive nuclear norm is generally non-convex under the natural\nrestriction that the weight decreases with the singular value. However, we show\nthat the proposed non-convex penalized regression method has a global optimal\nsolution obtained from an adaptively soft-thresholded singular value\ndecomposition. This new reduced-rank estimator is computationally efficient,\nhas continuous solution path and possesses better bias-variance property than\nits classical counterpart. The rank consistency and prediction/estimation\nperformance bounds of the proposed estimator are established under\nhigh-dimensional asymptotic regime. Simulation studies and an application in\ngenetics demonstrate that the proposed estimator has superior performance to\nseveral existing methods.

A desirable goal in practice is to\ndesign incentive compatible, individually rational, and Pareto optimal auctions\nwhile respecting the budget constraints. Achieving this goal is particularly\nchallenging in the presence of nontrivial combinatorial constraints over the\nset of feasible allocations.\n  Toward this goal and motivated by AdWords auctions, we present an auction for\n{\\em polymatroidal} environments satisfying the above properties. Our auction\nemploys a novel clinching technique with a clean geometric description and only\nneeds an oracle access to the submodular function defining the polymatroid. As\na result, this auction not only simplifies and generalizes all previous\nresults, it applies to several new applications including AdWords Auctions,\nbandwidth markets, and video on demand. In particular, our characterization of\nthe AdWords auction as polymatroidal constraints might be of independent\ninterest. This allows us to design the first mechanism for Ad Auctions taking\ninto account simultaneously budgets, multiple keywords and multiple slots.\n  We show that it is impossible to extend this result to generic polyhedral\nconstraints. This also implies an impossibility result for multi-unit auctions\nwith decreasing marginal utilities in the presence of budget constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2012 01:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 04:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 02:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-21"}

A sensor's battery is a crucial resource as\nit singly determines the lifetime of sensor network applications. Since these\ndevices are useful only when they are able to communicate with the world, radio\ntransceiver of a sensor as an I/O and a costly unit plays a key role in its\nlifetime. This resource often consumes a big portion of the sensor's energy as\nit must be active most of the time to announce the existence of the sensor in\nthe network. As such the radio component has to deal with its embedded sensor\nnetwork whose parameters and operations have significant effects on the\nsensor's lifetime. In existing energy models, hardware is considered, but the\nenvironment and the network's parameters did not receive adequate attention.\nEnergy consumption components of traditional network architecture are often\nconsidered individually and separately, and their influences on each other have\nnot been considered in these approaches. In this paper we consider all possible\ntasks of a sensor in its embedded network and propose an energy management\nmodel. We categorize these tasks in five energy consuming constituents. The\nsensor's Energy Consumption (EC) is modeled on its energy consuming\nconstituents and their input parameters and tasks. The sensor's EC can thus be\nreduced by managing and executing efficiently the tasks of its constituents.\nThe proposed approach can be effective for power management, and it also can be\nused to guide the design of energy efficient wireless sensor networks through\nnetwork parameterization and optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2012 05:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 12:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-06"}

The scatterers are often assumed to be\nspherical with a fixed diameter $d$, and the point particles move with constant\nvelocity between the scatterers, and are specularly reflected when hitting a\nscatterer. There is no interaction between point particles. An interesting\nquestion concerns the distribution of free path lengths, i.e. the distance a\npoint particle moves between the scattering events, and how this distribution\nscales with scatterer diameter, scatterer density and the distribution of the\nscatterers. It is by now well known that in the so-called Boltzmann-Grad limit,\na Poisson distribution of scatters leads to an exponential distribution of free\npath lengths, whereas if the scatterer distribution is periodic, the\ndistribution of free path behaves asymptotically like a Cauchy distribution.\n  This paper considers the case when the scatters are distributed on a quasi\ncrystal, i.e. non periodically, but with a long range order. Simulations of a\none-dimensional model are presented, showing that the quasi crystal behaves\nvery much like a periodic crystal, and in particular, the distribution of free\npath lengths is not exponential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2012 10:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The SNRs hosting a PWN\n(known as composite SNRs) provide excellent laboratories to test these\nhypotheses. The SNR G327.1-1.1 belongs to this category and exhibits a shell\nand a bright central PWN, both seen in radio and X-rays. Interestingly, the\nradio observations of the PWN show an extended blob of emission and a curious\nnarrow finger structure pointing towards the offset compact X-ray source\nindicating a possible fast moving pulsar in the SNR and/or an asymmetric\npassage of the reverse shock. We report here on the observations, for a total\nof 45 hours, of the SNR G327.1-1.1 with the H.E.S.S. telescope array which\nresulted in the detection of TeV gamma-ray emission in spatial coincidence with\nthe PWN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2012 15:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

For several years\nit had been conjectured that the answer is 17. We have performed an exhaustive\ncomputer search for 16-clue sudoku puzzles, and did not find any, thus proving\nthat the answer is indeed 17. In this article we describe our method and the\nactual search. As a part of this project we developed a novel way for\nenumerating hitting sets. The hitting set problem is computationally hard; it\nis one of Karp's 21 classic NP-complete problems. A standard backtracking\nalgorithm for finding hitting sets would not be fast enough to search for a\n16-clue sudoku puzzle exhaustively, even at today's supercomputer speeds. To\nmake an exhaustive search possible, we designed an algorithm that allowed us to\nefficiently enumerate hitting sets of a suitable size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2012 19:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2013 16:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-03"}
