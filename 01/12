Here, we\npresent the exact solutions for the WFs of a Bose crystal with rectangular\nlattice under natural zero boundary conditions.\n  The structure of WFs implies that 1) a crystal is formed by a standing wave\nin the probability field; 2) a crystal in the ground state contains a\ncondensate of atoms with the wave vector \\textbf{k}_l=(\\pi/\\bar{R}_x,\n\\pi/\\bar{R}_y, \\pi/\\bar{R}_z) (\\bar{R}_x, \\bar{R}_y, \\bar{R}_z are the periods\nof the lattice) that is equal to a half of the vector of the reciprocal\nlattice.

Based on the grid,\nwe also present a phase diagram for the expected final fates of rotating\nmassive Pop III stars. Our non-rotating models become redder than the previous\nmodels in the literature, given the larger overshooting parameter adopted in\nthis study. In particular, convective dredge-up of the helium core material\ninto the hydrogen envelope is observed in our non-rotating very massive star\nmodels (>~200 Msun), which is potentially important for the chemical yields. On\nthe other hand, the stars become bluer and more luminous with a higher\nrotational velocity. With the Spruit-Tayler dynamo, our models with a\nsufficiently high initial rotational velocity can reach the critical rotation\nearlier and lose more mass as a result, compared to the previous models without\nmagnetic fields. The most dramatic effect of rotation is found with the\nso-called chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), which is observed for a\nlimited mass and rotational velocity range. CHE has several important\nconsequences: 1) Both primary nitrogen and ionizing photons are abundantly\nproduced. 2) Conditions for gamma-ray burst progenitors are fulfilled for an\ninitial mass range of 13 - 84 Msun. 3) Pair instability supernovae of type Ibc\nare expected for 84 -190 Msun and 4) Both a pulsational pair instability\nsupernova and a GRB may occur from the same progenitor of about 56 - 84 Msun,\nwhich might significantly influence the consequent GRB afterglow.

However, commonly used algorithms\ncan yield unreliable results due to experimental noise, algorithmic\nstochasticity, and the influence of arbitrarily chosen parameter values.\nFurthermore, the results obtained typically provide only a simplistic view of\nthe network partitioned into disjoint communities and provide no information of\nthe relationship between communities.

Traditionally, nodes in network\nsynchronization models are coupled via one-to-one, or conservative\ninteractions. However, social interactions are often one-to-many, as for\nexample, in social media, where users broadcast messages to all their\nfollowers. We formulate a novel model of synchronization in a network of\ncoupled oscillators in which the oscillators are coupled via one-to-many, or\nnon-conservative interactions. We study the dynamics of different interaction\nmodels and contrast their spectral properties. To find multi-scale community\nstructure in a network of interacting nodes, we define a similarity function\nthat measures the degree to which nodes are synchronized and use it to\nhierarchically cluster nodes. We study real-world social networks, including\nnetworks of two social media providers.

From a user's perspective, an ideal\namplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has a\nhigh dynamic range - it is capable of handling strong signals with little\ndistortion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these\ncharacteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer\nmulti-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise\nremains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of\nquantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers\nand are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power\nfrom a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely\nreactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the\nquantum-mechanical limit. Indeed, microwave frequency superconducting Josephson\nparametric amplifiers do approach the quantum limit, but generally are narrow\nband and have very limited dynamic range. In this paper, we describe a\nsuperconducting parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations. The\namplifier is very simple, consisting only of a patterned metal film on a\ndielectric substrate, and relies on the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a\nsuperconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2 GHz on\neither side of an 11.56 GHz pump tone, and we place an upper limit on the added\nnoise of the amplifier of 3.4 photons at 9.4 GHz. Furthermore, the dynamic\nrange is very large, comparable to microwave transistor amplifiers, and the\nconcept can be applied throughout the microwave, millimeter-wave and\nsubmillimeter-wave bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 20:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-12"}

Using this sample, the\ndifferences between `high-excitation' (or `quasar-mode'; HERG) and\n`low-excitation' (`radio-mode'; LERG) radio galaxies are investigated. A\nprimary difference is the distinct nature of the Eddington-scaled accretion\nrate onto their central black holes: HERGs typically have accretion rates\nbetween 1 and 10% of Eddington, whereas LERGs predominatly accrete at a rate\nbelow 1% Eddington. This is consistent with models where the population\ndichotomy is caused by a switch between radiatively efficient and inefficient\naccretion modes at low accretion rates. Local radio luminosity functions are\nderived separately for the two populations, showing that although LERGs\ndominate at low luminosity and HERGs above 1e26 W/Hz, examples of both classes\nare found at all radio luminosities. Using the V/Vmax test it is shown that the\npopulations show differential cosmic evolution at fixed radio luminosity: HERGs\nevolve strongly at all luminosities, while LERGs show weak or no evolution.\nThis suggests that the luminosity-dependent evolution of the radio luminosity\nfunction is driven, at least in part, by the changing relative contributions of\nthese two populations with luminosity. The host galaxies of the sources are\nalso distinct: HERGs are typically of lower stellar mass, with lower black hole\nmasses, bluer colours and weaker 4000-Ang breaks indicating younger stellar\npopulations. These results offer strong support to the picture in which HERGs\nare fuelled at high rates through radiative accretion disks by cold gas,\nperhaps from mergers and interactions, while LERGs are fuelled via radiatively\ninefficient flows at low accretion rates, often by gas associated with the hot\nX-ray haloes of their host galaxy/cluster, as part of a radio-AGN feedback loop\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 20:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

All exhibit the familiar tadpole shape seen in photoevaporating objects\nsuch as the Orion proplyds, with a bright ionization front at the head facing\nthe central cluster of massive stars, and a tail stretching in the opposite\ndirection. Many also show secondary ionization fronts, complex tail\nmorphologies or multiple heads.

The rest-frame UV emission is key to\nmeasure the cosmic SFR. However, UV light is strongly reddened by dust. In\nstarburst galaxies, the UV colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing to\ncorrect for dust extinction. Unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating that\nthe relation between UV colour and attenuation is different for normal\nstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. It is still not\nunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the UV colour-attenuation\nrelation of starburst galaxies. Previous work and models hint that the role of\nthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have an\nimportant role. In this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasons\nto explain this deviation. We have used the CIGALE SED fitting code to model\nthe far UV to the far IR emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiral\ngalaxies from the HRS. We have explored the influence of a wide range of\nphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accurate\ndetermination of the attenuation from the UV colour, and why normal galaxies do\nnot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. We have found that the\ndeviation can be best explained by intrinsic UV colour differences between\ndifferent regions in galaxies. Variations in the shape of the attenuation curve\ncan also play a secondary role. Standard age estimators of the stellar\npopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic UV colour. These\nresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering their\nintegrated fluxes. When correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxies\nfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations in\nthe intrinsic UV colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuation\ncurve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Model 1\nassumes that the fractional stellar mass loss of a galaxy is proportional to\nthe fractional amount of dark matter mass loss of its subhalo. Model 2 accounts\nfor a delay in the time that stellar mass is lost since the galaxy resides deep\nin the potential well of the subhalo which may experience dark matter mass loss\nfor some time before the galaxy is affected. We use these models to predict the\nstellar masses of a population of galaxies and use abundance matching to\npredict the clustering of several r-band luminosity threshold samples from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. Abundance matching assuming no stellar mass loss\n(akin to abundance matching at the time of subhalo infall) over-estimates the\ncorrelation function on small scales (<~ 1 Mpc), while allowing too much\nstellar mass loss leads to an under-estimate. For each sample, we are thus able\nto constrain the amount of stellar mass loss required to match the observed\nclustering.

We note\nthat the PACS number counts are relatively robust to changes in the dust\nemission templates, while the predicted SPIRE number counts are more template\ndependent. We present quantitative predictions for the relationship between the\nobserved PACS 160 and SPIRE 250 micron fluxes and physical quantities such as\nhalo mass, stellar mass, cold gas mass, star formation rate, and total infrared\n(IR) luminosity, at different redshifts. We also present quantitative\npredictions for the correlation between PACS 160 micron flux and the\nprobability that a galaxy has experienced a recent major or minor merger.\nAlthough our models predict a strong correlation between these quantities, such\nthat more IR-luminous galaxies are more likely to be merger-driven, we find\nthat more than half of all high redshift IR-luminous galaxies detected by\nHerschel are able to attain their high star formation rates without enhancement\nby a merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

DDM\nmodels have been studied, in part, as a way to address apparent discrepancies\nbetween the predictions of standard cold dark matter models and observations of\ngalactic structure. Our study is aimed at developing independent constraints on\nthese models. In such models, DDM decays into a less massive, stable dark\nmatter (SDM) particle and a significantly lighter particle. The small mass\nsplitting between the parent DDM and the daughter SDM provides the SDM with a\nrecoil or \"kick\" velocity vk, inducing a free-streaming suppression of matter\nfluctuations. This suppression may be probed via weak lensing power spectra\nmeasured by a number of forthcoming imaging surveys that aim primarily to\nconstrain dark energy. Using scales on which linear perturbation theory alone\nis valid (multipoles < 300), surveys like Euclid or LSST can be sensitive to vk\n> 90 km/s for lifetimes ~ 1-5 Gyr. To estimate more aggressive constraints, we\nmodel nonlinear corrections to lensing power using a simple halo evolution\nmodel that is in good agreement with numerical simulations. In our most\nambitious forecasts, using multipoles < 3000, we find that imaging surveys can\nbe sensitive to vk ~ 10 km/s for lifetimes < 10 Gyr. Lensing will provide a\nparticularly interesting complement to existing constraints in that they will\nprobe the long lifetime regime far better than contemporary techniques. A\ncaveat to these ambitious forecasts is that the evolution of perturbations on\nnonlinear scales will need to be well calibrated by numerical simulations\nbefore they can be realized. This work motivates the pursuit of such a\nnumerical simulation campaign to constrain dark matter with cosmological weak\nlensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2012 21:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Inadequate number of projections in each phase bin\nresults in low quality 4D-CBCT images with obvious streaking artifacts. In this\nwork, we propose two novel 4D-CBCT algorithms: an iterative reconstruction\nalgorithm and an enhancement algorithm, utilizing a temporal nonlocal means\n(TNLM) method. We define a TNLM energy term for a given set of 4D-CBCT images.\nMinimization of this term favors those 4D-CBCT images such that any anatomical\nfeatures at one spatial point at one phase can be found in a nearby spatial\npoint at neighboring phases. 4D-CBCT reconstruction is achieved by minimizing a\ntotal energy containing a data fidelity term and the TNLM energy term. As for\nthe image enhancement, 4D-CBCT images generated by the FDK algorithm are\nenhanced by minimizing the TNLM function while keeping the enhanced images\nclose to the FDK results. A forward-backward splitting algorithm and a\nGauss-Jacobi iteration method are employed to solve the problems. The\nalgorithms are implemented on GPU to achieve a high computational efficiency.\nThe reconstruction algorithm and the enhancement algorithm generate visually\nsimilar 4D-CBCT images, both better than the FDK results. Quantitative\nevaluations indicate that, compared with the FDK results, our reconstruction\nmethod improves contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) by a factor of 2.56~3.13 and our\nenhancement method increases the CNR by 2.75~3.33 times. The enhancement method\nalso removes over 80% of the streak artifacts from the FDK results.

Our limits are more restrictive than past EGRET-based\noptimistic limits that do not include these important corrections.\nAdditionally, our limits are more stringent than LHC based limits for 3 or\nfewer LED, and comparable for 4 LED. We conclude that if the effective Planck\nscale is around a TeV, then for 2 or 3 LED the compactification topology must\nbe more complicated than a torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 01:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

In this paper a fully coupled model of bone remodeling\nis developed, based on coupling a bone cell population model with a\nmicromechanical homogenization scheme of bone stiffness. While the former model\nconsiders biochemical regulatory mechanisms between bone cells such as the\nRANK-RANKL-OPG pathway and action of TGF-\\beta, the latter model allows for\naccurate upscaling of the mechanical properties of bone. Importantly, we\nconsider bone remodeling as being controlled proportionally to the microscopic\nstrain energy density, on the observation scale where the sensing of the\nmechanical loading takes place, estimated by means of continuum\nmicromechanics-based strain concentration.

In agreement with the work of Doplicher,\nFredenhagen and Roberts (DFR), imposing the principle of gravitational\nstability against localization of events, we find that the region where an\nevent is localized, or where initial conditions can be assigned, has a minimal\nextension, of the order of the Planck length. This conclusion, though limited\nto the case of spherical symmetry, is more general than that of DFR, since it\ndoes not require the use of the notion of energy through the Heisenberg\nPrinciple, nor of any approximation as the linearized Einstein equations.\n  We shall then describe the influence of this minimal length scale in a\ncosmological model, namely a simple universe filled with radiation, which is\neffectively described by a conformally coupled scalar field in a conformal KMS\nstate. Solving the backreaction, a power law inflation scenario appears close\nto the initial singularity. Furthermore, the initial singularity becomes light\nlike and thus the standard horizon problem is avoided in this simple model.\nThis indication goes in the same direction as those drawn at a heuristic level\nfrom a full use of the principle of gravitational stability against\nlocalization of events, which point to a background dependence of the effective\nPlanck length, through which a-causal effects may be transmitted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 10:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 10:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 15:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

By analyzing the frequency spectrum of the integrated\nbrightness we can obtain greater knowledge about these phenomena. It is shown\nhow the frequency spectrum of the integrated brightness of the Sun in the\nfrequency range from 0.1 to 3.2 mHz shows clear signs of both granulation,\nfaculae and p-mode oscillations and that the measured characteristic\ntime-scales and amplitudes of the acoustic signals from granulation and faculae\nare consistent with high-resolution observations of the solar surface. Using 13\nyears of observations of the Sun's integrated brightness from the VIRGO\ninstrument on the SOHO satellite it is shown that the significance of the\nfacular component varies with time and that it has a significance above 0.99\naround half the time. Furthermore, an analysis of the temporal variability in\nthe measured amplitudes of both the granulation, faculae and p-mode oscillation\ncomponents in the frequency spectrum reveals that the amplitude of the p-mode\noscillation component shows variability that follows the solar cycles, while\nthe amplitudes of the granulation and facular components show signs of\nquasi-annual and quasi-biennial variability, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 12:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In\na regular stacking of \"hard\" and \"soft\" layers, the tensile stress is first\naccommodated by a large deformation of the soft layers. The inhibited Poisson\ncontraction results in a compressive stress in the direction transverse to the\ntensile deformation axis. The hard layers sustain this transverse compression\nuntil buckling takes place and results in an undulated structure. Using\nmolecular simulations, we demonstrate this scenario for a material made of\ntriblock copolymers. The buckling deformation is observed to take place at the\nnanoscale, at a wavelength that depends on strain rate. In contrast to what is\ncommonly assumed, the wavelength of the undulation is not determined by defects\nin the microstructure. Rather, it results from kinetic effects, with a\ncompetition between the rate of strain and the growth rate of the instability.\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/12/23/1111367109.abstract\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 12:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-13"}

Previous studies have shown that the power spectra can be\napproximated as two power-laws, a shallow one at large scales (larger than 500\npc) and a steeper one at small scales, with the break between the two\ncorresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. We present a\nthorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at several\nwavelengths in the nearby galaxy M33. In particular, we use the recently\nobtained images at five wavelengths by PACS and SPIRE onboard Herschel. The\nlarge dynamical range (2-3 dex in scale) of most images allow us to determine\nclearly the change in slopes from -1.5 to -4, with some variations with\nwavelength. The break scale is increasing with wavelength, from 100 pc at 24\nand 100micron to 350 pc at 500micron, suggesting that the cool dust lies in a\nthicker disk than the warm dust, may be due to star formation more confined to\nthe plane. The slope at small scale tends to be steeper at longer wavelength,\nmeaning that the warmer dust is more concentrated in clumps. Numerical\nsimulations of an isolated late-type galaxy, rich in gas and with no bulge,\nlike M33, are carried out, in order to better interpret these observed results.\nVarying the star formation and feedback parameters, it is possible to obtain a\nrange of power-spectra, with two power-law slopes and breaks, which nicely\nbracket the data. The small-scale power-law is indeed reflecting the 3D\nbehaviour of the gas layer, steepening strongly while the feedback smoothes the\nstructures, by increasing the gas turbulence. M33 appears to correspond to a\nfiducial model with an SFR of $\\sim$ 0.7 Mo/yr, with 10% supernovae energy\ncoupled to the gas kinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 13:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

However, for a slowly decaying channel and\ndensely populated interferers, a small size neighborhood often results in\nnontrivial link outages and is thus insufficient for making optimal scheduling\ndecisions. A question arises how to deal with the information outside a\nneighborhood in distributed link-scheduling. In this work, we develop joint\napproximation of information and distributed link scheduling. We first apply\nmachine learning approaches to model distributed link-scheduling with complete\ninformation. We then characterize the information outside a neighborhood in\nform of residual interference as a random loss variable. The loss variable is\nfurther characterized by either a Mean Field approximation or a normal\ndistribution based on the Lyapunov central limit theorem. The approximated\ninformation outside a neighborhood is incorporated in a factor graph. This\nresults in joint approximation and distributed link-scheduling in an iterative\nfashion. Link-scheduling decisions are first made at each individual node based\non the approximated loss variables. Loss variables are then updated and used\nfor next link-scheduling decisions. The algorithm repeats between these two\nphases until convergence. Interactive iterations among these variables are\nimplemented with a message-passing algorithm over a factor graph. Simulation\nresults show that using learned information outside a neighborhood jointly with\ndistributed link-scheduling reduces the outage probability close to zero even\nfor a small neighborhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 14:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2012 23:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

In this scenario two basic mechanisms compete,\nthe modified Hubble expansion rate tending to increase the relic density and a\ndissipative force that tends to decrease it. The net effect can lead to an\noverall dramatic decrease of the predicted relic abundance, sometimes by\namounts of the order of O(10^2) or so. This feature is rather generic,\nindependent of any particular assumption on the underlying string dynamics,\nprovided dilaton dominates at early eras after the end of inflation but before\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The latter ensures that BBN is not upset by the\npresence of the dilaton. In this paper, within the context of such a scenario,\nwe study the phenomenology of the constrained minimal supersymmetric model\n(CMSSM) by taking into account all recent experimental constraints, including\nthose from the LHC searches. We find that the allowed parameter space is\ngreatly enlarged and includes regions that are beyond the reach of LHC. The\nallowed regions are compatible with Direct Dark Matter searches since the small\nneutralino annihilation rates, that are now in accord with the cosmological\ndata on the relic density, imply small neutralino-nucleon cross sections below\nthe sensitivities of the Direct Dark Matter experiments. It is also important\nthat the new cosmologically accepted regions are compatible with Higgs boson\nmasses larger than 120 GeV, as it is indicated from the LHC experimental data.\nThe smaller annihilation cross sections needed to explain WMAP data require\nthat the detector performances of current and planned indirect DM search\nexperiments through gamma rays should be greatly improved in order to probe the\nCMSSM regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 15:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 06:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Assessing the\nstatistical significance of time variability of gamma-ray sources above 100 MeV\nis a primary task of the AGILE data analysis. In particular, it is important to\ncheck the instrument sensitivity in terms of Poisson modeling of the data\nbackground, and to determine the post-trial confidence of detections. The goals\nof this work are: (i) evaluating the distributions of the likelihood ratio test\nfor \"empty\" fields, and for regions of the Galactic plane; (ii) calculating the\nprobability of false detection over multiple time intervals. In this paper we\ndescribe in detail the techniques used to search for short-term variability in\nthe AGILE gamma-ray source database. We describe the binned maximum likelihood\nmethod used for the analysis of AGILE data, and the numerical simulations that\nsupport the characterization of the statistical analysis. We apply our method\nto both Galactic and extra-galactic transients, and provide a few examples.\nAfter having checked the reliability of the statistical description tested with\nthe real AGILE data, we obtain the distribution of p-values for blind and\nspecific source searches. We apply our results to the determination of the\npost-trial statistical significance of detections of transient gamma-ray\nsources in terms of pre-trial values. The results of our analysis allow a\nprecise determination of the post-trial significance of {\\gamma}-ray sources\ndetected by AGILE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2012 15:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

An\nincreasing number of projects have mapped CNAs using high-resolution microarray\nbased techniques. So far, no single resource does provide a global collection\nof readily accessible oncoge- nomic array data.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: We here present arrayMap, a curated reference\ndatabase and bioinformatics resource targeting copy number profiling data in\nhuman cancer. The arrayMap database provides a platform for meta-analysis and\nsystems level data integration of high-resolution oncogenomic CNA data. To\ndate, the resource incorporates more than 40,000 arrays in 224 cancer types\nextracted from several resources, including the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus\n(GEO), EBIs ArrayExpress (AE), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), publication\nsupplements and direct submissions. For the majority of the included datasets,\nprobe level and integrated visualization facilitate gene level and genome wide\ndata re- view. Results from multi-case selections can be connected to\ndownstream data analysis and visualization tools.\n  Conclusions/Significance: To our knowledge, currently no data source provides\nan extensive collection of high resolution oncogenomic CNA data which readily\ncould be used for genomic feature mining, across a representative range of\ncancer entities. arrayMap represents our effort for providing a long term\nplatform for oncogenomic CNA data independent of specific platform\nconsiderations or specific project dependence.
