These results represent the limit in our\nquest for the ultimate OFET performance. However, band-like transport has not\nbeen reported for n-channel OFETs and, for p-channel transistors, it is not\nunderstood why it occurs only for certain molecular materials. Here we report\nband-like electron transport for n-channel OFETs based on PDIF-CN2\nsingle-crystals. Devices with different gate dielectrics - vacuum, Cytop, PMMA\n- are compared and we find that the performance is suppressed for those with\nlarger dielectric constant. This phenomenon parallels that observed for holes\nin p-channel OFETs, however, the magnitude of the suppression is smaller, an\neffect that can be rationalized by the semiconductor molecular structure and\ncrystal packing. A quantitative analysis of our findings, together with results\non different high-quality p-channel transistors, indicates the importance of\nthe interplay between the semiconductor molecular polarizability and the\nstructure of the charge transport layers in the crystal, as a key factor\nenabling band-like transport. Based on these considerations, we suggest\nunprecedented structure-property relationships useful for performance\noptimization of high-mobility organic transistors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 16:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-10"}

In this paper we derive the symplectic\ndynamics that govern the evolution of the system and then present the\nimplementation of the program in Python and PyCUDA.

Power is empirically estimated by simulating phenotypes under a\ndisease model H1. For this purpose, the \"gold\" standard consists in simulating\ngenotypes given the phenotypes (e.g. Hapgen). We introduce here an alternative\napproach for simulating phenotypes under H1 that does not require generating\nnew genotypes for each simulation. In order to simulate phenotypes with a fixed\ntotal number of cases and under a given disease model, we suggest three\nalgorithms: i) a simple rejection algorithm; ii) a numerical Markov Chain\nMonte-Carlo (MCMC) approach; iii) and an exact and efficient backward sampling\nalgorithm. In our study, we validated the three algorithms both on a\ntoy-dataset and by comparing them with Hapgen on a more realistic dataset. As\nan application, we then conducted a simulation study on a 1000 Genomes Project\ndataset consisting of 629 individuals (314 cases) and 8,048 SNPs from\nChromosome X. We arbitrarily defined an additive disease model with two\nsusceptibility SNPs and an epistatic effect. The three algorithms are\nconsistent, but backward sampling is dramatically faster than the other two.\nOur approach also gives consistent results with Hapgen. Using our application\ndata, we showed that our limited design requires a biological a priori to limit\nthe investigated region. We also proved that epistatic effects can play a\nsignificant role even when simple marker statistics (e.g. trend) are used. We\nfinally showed that the overall performance of a GWA study strongly depends on\nthe prevalence of the disease: the larger the prevalence, the better the power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 16:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-25"}

The lack of an objective way of comparing\nmodels has, sometimes, led to opposing views of the solar magnetism because the\ninferred physical scenarios are essentially different.

In the matter of\nidentity of multi-particle states of indistinguishable particles, these\ncontrasting ontological attitudes are mirrored by the \"bundle\" vs. haecceity\nviews. We offer some arguments aimed at importing the above theorems to the\nissue of identity in quantum theory, with the conclusion (under certain\nassumptions) that indistinguishable particles either lack individualism or\npossess a definite identity with a caveat of contextuality or nonlocality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 18:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-25"}

Metals have a larger impact on the\nPDF measurements at lower redshift, where there are fewer Lyman alpha\nabsorption lines. This may be explained by an increase in the number of metal\nlines which are blended with Lyman alpha absorption lines toward higher\nredshift, but may also be due to the presence of fewer metals in the\nintergalactic medium with increasing lookback time. We also provide a new\nmeasurement of the redshift evolution of the effective optical depth, tau_eff,\nat 2.8 < z < 3.6, and find no evidence for a deviation from a power law\nevolution in the log(tau_eff)-log(1+z) plane. The flux PDF measurements are\nfurthermore of interest for studies of the thermal state of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) at z ~ 3 . By comparing the PDF to state-of-the-art cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations, we place constraints on the temperature of the IGM\nand compare our results with previous measurements of the PDF at lower\nredshift.

We find, based on\nX-ray and GeV afterglows, an acceleration rate that is most likely very fast,\napproaching the Bohm limit, when the shock Lorentz factor is in the range of\n10-100. In that case X-ray observations may be consistent with no amplification\nof the magnetic field in the shock upstream region.

Graphene provides a platform to study\nunique many-body effects due to its massless chiral charge carriers and the\nfourfold degeneracy that arises from their spin and valley degrees of freedom.\nHere we report local electronic compressibility measurements of a suspended\ngraphene flake performed using a scanning single-electron transistor.

An immediate application is to\nprovide rapid contemporaneous radio coverage of AGN flaring at {\\gamma}-ray\nfrequencies detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.\n  Methods. A single baseline interferometer was formed with radio telescopes in\nHobart, Tasmania and Ceduna, South Australia. A software correlator was set up\nat the University of Tasmania to correlate these data.\n  Results. Measurements of the flux densities of flaring objects can be made\nusing our observing strategy within half an hour of a triggering event. These\nobservations can be calibrated with amplitude errors better than 15%. Lower\nlimits to the brightness temperatures of the sources can also be calculated\nusing CHI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 00:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this paper we consider the downlink of a wireless network with $N$\nAccess Points (AP's) and $M$ clients, where each client is connected to several\nout-of-band AP's, and requests delay-sensitive traffic (e.g., real-time video).\nWe adopt the framework of Hou, Borkar, and Kumar, and study the maximum total\ntimely throughput of the network, denoted by $C_{T^3}$, which is the maximum\naverage number of packets delivered successfully before their deadline. Solving\nthis problem is challenging since even the number of different ways of\nassigning packets to the AP's is $N^M$. We overcome the challenge by proposing\na deterministic relaxation of the problem, which converts the problem to a\nnetwork with deterministic delays in each link. We show that the additive gap\nbetween the capacity of the relaxed problem, denoted by $C_{det}$, and\n$C_{T^3}$ is bounded by $2\\sqrt{N(C_{det}+N/4)}$, which is asymptotically\nnegligible compared to $C_{det}$, when the network is operating at\nhigh-throughput regime.\n  In addition, our numerical results show that the actual gap between $C_{T^3}$\nand $C_{det}$ is in most cases much less than the worst-case gap proven\nanalytically.

The terrestrial planets finished accreting much\nlater (Klein et al. 2009), and their characteristics, including Mars' small\nmass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer\nedge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (Wetherill 1978, Hansen 2009)\n(1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar\nSystem that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 AU, and its\nsubsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 AU;\nthe terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million\nyears, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering\nby Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with\ninner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 AU and outer-belt bodies\noriginating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant\ncompositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from\nprevious models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial\nmigration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more\nsimilar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 03:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-26"}

This study is motivated\nby the puzzling signal of alignment of polarizations from distant quasars at\noptical frequencies. We explore several different cuts on the polarization flux\nfor our analysis. We find that the entire data shows a very significant signal\nof alignment on very large distance scales of order 500 Mpc. The alignment\nstarts to decay only at much larger distances of order Gpc. If we only consider\ndata with polarization flux greater than 1 mJy, we find alignment at distance\nscales less than 150 Mpc. We also find that data with polarization flux less\nthan 0.5 mJy does not show significant alignment. Similar results are seen for\ndata with degree of polarization less than 0.01, although here a mild signal of\nalignment is observed for a narrow range of angular separations. We argue that\nthe signal cannot be explained in terms of bias due to systematic errors in\nremoval of instrumental polarization. We also find that the degree of\npolarization shows a strong negative correlation with the total flux. The data\nappears to fall into two classes, one of which shows such a correlation. The\nremaining set, which has total flux greater than 100 mJy and degree of\npolarization lying between 0.01 and 0.1, shows a more random behaviour.

Once accelerated in\nthe pulsar wind, nuclei have to escape from the surrounding supernova envelope.\nWe examine this escape analytically and numerically, and discuss the pulsar\nsource scenario in light of the latest ultrahigh energy cosmic ray (UHECR)\ndata. Our calculations show that, at early times, when protons can be\naccelerated to energies E>10^20 eV, the young supernova shell tends to prevent\ntheir escape. In contrast, because of their higher charge, iron-peaked nuclei\nare still accelerated to the highest observed energies at later times, when the\nenvelope has become thin enough to allow their escape. Ultrahigh energy iron\nnuclei escape newly-born pulsars with millisecond periods and dipole magnetic\nfields of ~10^(12-13) G, embedded in core-collapse supernovae. Due to the\nproduction of secondary nucleons, the envelope crossing leads to a transition\nof composition from light to heavy elements at a few EeV, as observed by the\nAuger Observatory. The escape also results in a softer spectral slope than that\ninitially injected via unipolar induction, which allows for a good fit to the\nobserved UHECR spectrum. We conclude that the acceleration of iron-peaked\nelements in a reasonably small fraction (< 0.01%) of extragalactic\nrotation-powered young pulsars would reproduce satisfactorily the current UHECR\ndata. Possible signatures of this scenario are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 07:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

The SDW gap has Dirac nodes, because\nmany orbitals participate in the electronic states near the Fermi energy. Using\na two-orbital band model the electronic excitations near the Dirac node and the\nanti-node are found to have different symmetries. Applying the symmetry\ndifference to Raman scattering the nodal and anti-nodal electronic excitations\nare separately obtained. The low-energy spectra from the anti-nodal region have\ncritical fluctuation just above TSDW and change into the gap structure by the\nfirst order transition at TSDW, while those from the nodal region gradually\nchange into the SDW state. The selection rule for two-magnon scattering from\nthe stripe spin structure was obtained.

Thresholding plays a major\nin binarization of images. Thresholding can be categorized into global\nthresholding and local thresholding. In images with uniform contrast\ndistribution of background and foreground like document images, global\nthresholding is more appropriate. In degraded document images, where\nconsiderable background noise or variation in contrast and illumination exists,\nthere exists many pixels that cannot be easily classified as foreground or\nbackground. In such cases, binarization with local thresholding is more\nappropriate. This paper describes a locally adaptive thresholding technique\nthat removes background by using local mean and mean deviation. Normally the\nlocal mean computational time depends on the window size. Our technique uses\nintegral sum image as a prior processing to calculate local mean. It does not\ninvolve calculations of standard deviations as in other local adaptive\ntechniques. This along with the fact that calculations of mean is independent\nof window size speed up the process as compared to other local thresholding\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 10:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-26"}

In this paper we extend the\ntheory of Fujiwara about morphisms to the many-sorted algebras, by defining the\nconcept of polyderivor between many-sorted signatures, which assigns to basic\nsorts, words and to formal operations, families of derived terms, and under\nwhich the standard signature morphisms, the basic mapping-formulas of Fujiwara,\nand the derivors of Goguen-Thatcher-Wagner are subsumed.

Bloemer. The technique is based on the transference theorems\ngiven by Banaszczyk which imply some necessary conditions on the coefficients\nof the closest vectors with respect to a basis whose dual is HKZ reduced.\nRecursively, starting with the last coefficient, intervals of length i can be\nderived for the i-th coefficient of any closest vector. This leads to n!\ncandidates for closest vectors. In this paper we refine the necessary\nconditions derived from the transference theorems, giving an exponential\nreduction of the number of candidates. The improvement is due to the fact that\nthe lengths of the intervals are not independent. In the original algorithm the\ncandidates for a coefficient pair (a_i,a_{i+1}) correspond to the integer\npoints in a rectangle of volume i(i+1). In our analysis we show that the\ncandidates for (a_i,a_{i+1}) in fact lie in an ellipse with transverse and\nconjugate diameter i+1, respectively i. This reduces the overall number of\npoints to be enumerated by an exponential factor of about 0.886^n. We further\nshow how a choice of the coefficients (a_n,...,a_{i+1}) influences the interval\nfrom which a_i can be chosen.

Such an integrator is particularly suitable to\nobtain reliable trajectories of objects lying on high orbits, especially\ngeostationary ones. Indeed, it has already been demonstrated that such objects\ncould stay there for hundreds of years. Our model takes into account the\nEarth's gravitational potential, luni-solar and planetary gravitational\nperturbations and direct solar radiation pressure. Based on the analysis of the\nenergy conservation and on a comparison with a high order non-symplectic\nintegrator, we show that our algorithm allows us to use large time steps and\nkeep accurate results. We also propose an innovative method to model Earth's\nshadow crossings by means of a smooth shadow function. In the particular\nframework of symplectic integration, such a function needs to be included\nanalytically in the equations of motion in order to prevent numerical drifts of\nthe energy. For the sake of completeness, both cylindrical shadows and penumbra\ntransitions models are considered.

Flavor questions, it would seem, are of minor\nrelevance for this quest, apart from their role in constraining the possible\nstructure of EWSB physics. In this short review article, we outline, using\nflavor-dependent sleptons as an example, how flavor can affect both searches\nfor supersymmetry, and future measurements aimed at understanding the nature of\nany new discoveries. If the production cross-sections for supersymmetry are\nrelatively low, as indicated by the fact that it has not revealed itself yet in\nstandard searches, the usual assumptions about the superpartner spectra need\nre-thinking. Furthermore, one must consider more intricate searches, such as\nlepton-based searches, which could be susceptible to flavor effects. We start\nby reviewing the flavor structure of existing frameworks for mediating\nsupersymmetry breaking, emphasizing flavor-dependent models proposed recently.\nWe use the kinematic endpoints of invariant mass distributions to demonstrate\nhow flavor dependence can impact both searches for supersymmetry and the\nInverse Problem. We also discuss methods for measuring small-mass splittings\nand mixings at the LHC, both in models with a neutralino LSP and in models with\na charged slepton (N)LSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 14:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Large amounts of gas, dust, and stars cluster in the galaxy\nnucleus, and interactions between this ambient material and the jet base should\nbe frequent, having dynamical as well as radiative consequences. This work\nstudies the dynamical interaction of an obstacle, a clump of matter or the\natmosphere of an evolved star, with the innermost region of an extragalactic\njet. Jet mass-loading and the high-energy outcome of this interaction are\nbriefly discussed. Relativistic hydrodynamical simulations with axial symmetry\nhave been carried out for homogeneous and inhomogeneous obstacles inside a\nrelativistic jet. These obstacles may represent a medium inhomogeneity or the\ndisrupted atmosphere of a red giant star. Once inside the jet, an homogeneous\nobstacle expands and gets disrupted after few dynamical timescales, whereas in\nthe inhomogeneous case, a solid core can smoothen the process, with the\nobstacle mass-loss dominated by a dense and narrow tail pointing in the\ndirection of the jet. In either case, matter is expected to accelerate and\neventually get incorporated to the jet. Particles can be accelerated in the\ninteraction region, and produce variable gamma-rays in the ambient matter,\nmagnetic and photon fields. The presence of matter clumps or red giants into\nthe base of an extragalactic jet likely implies significant jet mass-loading\nand slowing down. Fast flare-like gamma-ray events, and some level of\npersistent emission, are expected due to these interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 14:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Cubes of diamond face-centered-cubic Si and (much rarer)\nface-centered-cubic C have been proposed, but these structures do not have\nnaturally-occurring facets (or numbers of atoms generally divisible by 12). We\nshow here that graphite prisms formed by stacking $m$ hexagonal graphene\nsheets, with $m \\equiv 51,150,060$ carbon-12 atoms on each side, are a natural\nsolution that may facilitate generation of precise molar standards as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 14:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2013 16:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 19:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 15:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The\nfractal manifold model is brought up as an illustration of space that is\nlocally homeomorphic to the fractal topological space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 08:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Those systems, however, are subject to security\nand operational risks because of their open and distributed nature. Reputation\nsystems provide a mechanism to reduce such risks by building trust\nrelationships among entities and identifying malicious entities. A popular\nreputation model is the so called flow-based model. Most existing reputation\nsystems based on such a model provide only a ranking, without absolute\nreputation values; this makes it difficult to determine whether entities are\nactually trustworthy or untrustworthy. In addition, those systems ignore a\nsignificant part of the available information; as a consequence, reputation\nvalues may not be accurate. In this paper, we present a flow-based reputation\nmetric that gives absolute values instead of merely a ranking. Our metric makes\nuse of all the available information. We study, both analytically and\nnumerically, the properties of the proposed metric and the effect of attacks on\nreputation values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 15:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-09"}

The $b$-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law\ncomes from the first origin. In the frame of natural time analysis of\nearthquake data, a fall of the b-value observed before large earthquakes\nreflects an increase of the order parameter fluctuations upon approaching the\ncritical point (mainshock). The increase of these fluctuations, however, is\nalso influenced from the second origin of self-similarity, i.e., temporal\ncorrelations between earthquake magnitudes.
