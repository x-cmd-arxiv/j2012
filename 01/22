The concept of shape in the microcosm is critically\nexamined. Special attention is devoted to properly define the meaning of shape\nfor bound-state systems of near massless quarks. The ideas that lead to the\nexpectation of non-sphericity in the shape of hadrons, the calculations that\npredict it, and the experimental information obtained from recent\nhigh-precision measurements are examined. Particular emphasis is given to the\nstudy of the electromagnetic transition between the nucleon and its first\nexcited state, the $\\Delta$(1232)-resonance. The experimental evidence is is\ncritically examined and compared with lattice calculations, as well as with\neffective-field theories and phenomenological models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2012 21:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-24"}

The first is a\none-component Plummer model, which may represent either a dark matter free\nprogenitor, or one in which pre-existing dark matter has already been largely\nstripped. The second is a two-component model in which the stars are\nrepresented by a Hernquist sphere embedded in a cosmologically modish\nNavarro-Frenk-White dark halo. Disruption of the models in the Milky Way galaxy\nprovides us with two tellings of the tale of the formation of the Sgr stream.\nThe initial disintegration of the baryons proceeds more slowly for the\ntwo-component models because of the protective cocoon of dark matter. Once this\nhas been stripped, though, matters proceed apace. In both cases, the profiles\nafter ~6 pericentric passages provide good matches to the observational data,\nbut the tails are more extended for the two-component models.\n  The leading and trailing tails are symmetric at apocentre or pericentre. At\nother orbital phases, asymmetries are present, as tails are compressed as they\napproach apocentre and stretched out as they approach pericentre. There may\nexist density enhancements corresponding to such pile-ups which may be\nobservable in current survey data. We re-visit the calculation of\nNiederste-Ostholt et al.

These micro-machines move along filament\ntracks, and have the ability to convert chemical energy into mechanical work\nthat powers cellular motility. Different types of motors are characterized by\ndifferent duty-ratios, which is the fraction of time that a motor is attached\nto its filament. In the case of myosin II - a non-processive molecular machine\nwith a low duty ratio - cooperativity between several motors is essential to\ninduce motion along its actin filament track. In this work we use statistical\nmechanical tools to calculate the duty ratio of cooperative molecular motors.\nThe model suggests that the effective duty ratio of non-processive motors that\nwork in cooperation is lower than the duty ratio of the individual motors. The\norigin of this effect is the elastic tension that develops in the filament\nwhich is relieved when motors detach from the track.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2012 07:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We show recent examples of the\napplication of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) seismology techniques to infer\nphysical parameters in prominence plasmas. They are based on the application of\ninversion techniques using observed periods, damping times, and plasma flow\nspeeds of prominence thread oscillations. The contribution of Hinode to the\nsubject has been of central importance. We show an example based on data\nobtained with Hinode's Solar Optical Telescope. Observations show an active\nregion limb prominence, composed by a myriad of thin horizontal threads that\nflow following a path parallel to the photosphere and display synchronous\nvertical oscillations. The coexistence of waves and flows can be firmly\nestablished. By making use of an interpretation based on transverse MHD kink\noscillations, a seismological analysis of this event is performed. It is shown\nthat the combination of high quality Hinode observations and proper theoretical\nmodels allows flows and waves to become two useful characteristics for our\nunderstanding of the nature of solar prominences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2012 12:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-24"}

In addition,\nsigns of orbital phase dependent photometric variations, sometimes seen quite\nearly in the development of nova outbursts, are hard to interpret in the\nframework of optically thick envelopes and especially winds. A general\ndiscussion for belief in the presence of optically thick winds with increasing\nejection velocities during the early stages of novae after their explosion,\nmust be given. This has to be done in order to clarify ideas about novae as\nwell as to contribute in particular to the understanding of the behaviour of\nnovae V1500 Cyg and V1493 Aql showing phase dependent variations during very\nearly decline after the outburst. Possible ways of overcoming the apparent\ncontradiction of phase dependent variations through the production of\ndeviations from spherical symmetry of the winds, are looked at and order of\nmagnitude estimates are made for different theoretical scenarios, which might\nproduce such deviations. It is found that large deviations from spherical\nsymmetry of the optically thick winds in early phases after the explosion can\neasily explain the problem of variations. In particular, the presence of a\nmagnetic field might have had a non-negligible effect on the wind of V1500 Cyg,\nwhile at the present there is not enough information available concerning V1493\nAql. Optically thick winds/envelopes are almost certainly present in the early\nstages after optical maximum of a nova, while it is difficult to make pure\nHubble flow models fit the observations of those stages. New more detailed\nobservational and theoretical work, in particular including the effects of\nmagnetic fields on the winds, is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2012 14:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-24"}
