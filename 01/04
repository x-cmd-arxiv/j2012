Improvements of ALICE sub-detectors are\nenvisaged for the upgrade plans of year 2017. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is\na proposal in view of this upgrade, motivated both by the possibility to\novercome the intrinsic limitations of the Muon Spectrometer, and by the\npossibility to perform new measurements of general interest for the whole ALICE\nphysics. The measurement of the offset of single muons and dimuons will permit\nto disentangle open charm ($c\\tau \\sim 150 \\mu$m) and beauty ($c\\tau \\sim 500\n\\mu$m) production. The MFT, thanks to its tracking capabilities, will allow to\nimprove the mass resolution of the resonances for a better separation between\n$\\rho/\\omega$ and $\\phi$, $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$, and $-$ to a lesser extent $-$\n$\\Upsilon$ family resonances. In addition, it will help to reject a large\nfraction of muons coming from pion and kaon decays, improving the signal over\nbackground ratio. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this upgrade, a setup\ncomposed by five silicon planes was simulated within the AliRoot framework. In\nthis report, we present preliminary results on the MFT performances in a\nlow-multiplicity environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 16:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

Conventional channel estimation methods for TDS-OFDM are based\non the exploitation of the PN sequence and consequently suffer from intersymbol\ninterference (ISI). This paper proposes a novel dataaided channel estimation\nmethod which combines the channel estimates obtained from the PN sequence and,\nmost importantly, additional channel estimates extracted from OFDM data\nsymbols. Data-aided channel estimation is carried out using the rebuilt OFDM\ndata symbols as virtual training sequences. In contrast to the classical turbo\nchannel estimation, interleaving and decoding functions are not included in the\nfeedback loop when rebuilding OFDM data symbols thereby reducing the\ncomplexity. Several improved techniques are proposed to refine the data-aided\nchannel estimates, namely one-dimensional (1-D)/two-dimensional (2-D) moving\naverage and Wiener filtering. Finally, the MMSE criteria is used to obtain the\nbest combination results and an iterative process is proposed to progressively\nrefine the estimation. Both MSE and BER simulations using specifications of the\nDTMB system are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm even in very harsh channel conditions such as in the single frequency\nnetwork (SFN) case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 16:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

Our approach is based on the number-conserving variational\ntime-dependent mean field theory [O. E. Alon, A. I. Streltsov, and L. S.\nCederbaum, Phys. Lett.

Both symmetric and asymmetric double-wells are studied for several\ninteraction strengths and barrier heights. The cases of condensed and two-fold\nfragmented ground states are compared.

The aforementioned correlation functions are\nspecial cases of the so-called {\\it canonical} $n$-point correlation function\n$H_n$ and generalize the ones that have been recently employed to advance our\nability to reconstruct complex microstructures [Y.

As hair bundles move, the viscous\nfriction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental\nchallenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part\nof the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for\nfrequency-selective sound amplification. Here we demonstrate that a\ncomplementary part involves the fluid-structure interaction between the liquid\nwithin the hair bundle and the stereocilia. Using force measurement on a\ndynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of\nhydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric\nmeasurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the\nforces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections. We\nfind that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the\nliquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative\nsqueezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion. The obliquely\noriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least\ndissipative coherent mode, whereas the elastic horizontal top connectors\nstabilize the structure, further reducing the drag. As measured from the\ndistortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation\namplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of forces in a hair bundle\npermits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses\nonly a fraction of a nanometre. A combination of high-resolution experiments\nand detailed numerical modelling of fluid-structure interactions reveals the\nphysical principles behind the basic structural features of hair bundles and\nshows quantitatively how these organelles are adapted to the needs of sensitive\nmechanotransduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 20:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-04"}

Communities, also known as clusters or modules, are typically\nconsidered to be densely interconnected groups of nodes that are only sparsely\nconnected to other groups in the network. Discovering high quality communities\nis a difficult and important problem in a number of areas. The most popular\napproach is the objective function known as modularity, used both to discover\ncommunities and to measure their strength. To understand the modular structure\nof networks it is then crucial to know how such functions evaluate different\ntopologies, what features they account for, and what implicit assumptions they\nmay make. We show that trees and treelike networks can have unexpectedly and\noften arbitrarily high values of modularity. This is surprising since trees are\nmaximally sparse connected graphs and are not typically considered to possess\nmodular structure, yet the nonlocal null model used by modularity assigns low\nprobabilities, and thus high significance, to the densities of these sparse\ntree communities. We further study the practical performance of popular methods\non model trees and on a genealogical data set and find that the discovered\ncommunities also have very high modularity, often approaching its maximum\nvalue. Statistical tests reveal the communities in trees to be significant, in\ncontrast with known results for partitions of sparse, random graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 20:46:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 19:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

Specifically, we perform local and\nglobal simulations of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and the\nheat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and assess the effects of viscosity\non their saturation and astrophysical implications. We find that viscosity has\nonly a modest effect on the saturation of the MTI.

At smaller radii in cool-core clusters, viscosity\ncan decrease the linear growth rates of the HBI. However, it has less of an\neffect on the HBI's nonlinear saturation, in part because three-dimensional\ninterchange motions (magnetic flux tubes slipping past each other) are not\ndamped by anisotropic viscosity. In global simulations of cool core clusters,\nwe show that the HBI robustly inhibits radial thermal conduction and thus\nprecipitates a cooling catastrophe. The effects of viscosity are, however, more\nimportant for higher entropy clusters. We argue that viscosity can contribute\nto the global transition of cluster cores from cool-core to non cool-core\nstates: additional sources of intracluster turbulence, such as can be produced\nby AGN feedback or galactic wakes, suppress the HBI, heating the cluster core\nby thermal conduction; this makes the ICM more viscous, which slows the growth\nof the HBI, allowing further conductive heating of the cluster core and a\ntransition to a non cool-core state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-06"}

However, these observations alone allow for a wide range of reionization\nscenarios due to uncertainties in the abundance of faint galaxies and the\nescape fraction of ionizing photons. We show that requiring continuity with\npost-reionization (z<6) measurements, where the Lya forest provides a complete\nprobe of the cosmological emissivity of ionizing photons, significantly reduces\nthe permitted parameter space. Models that are simultaneously consistent with\nthe measured UV luminosity function, the Thomson optical depth to the CMB, and\nthe Lya forest data require either: 1) extrapolation of the galaxy luminosity\nfunction down to very faint UV magnitudes M_lim ~ -10, corresponding roughly to\nthe UV background suppression scale; 2) an increase of f_esc by a factor > ~10\nfrom z=4 (where the best fit is 4%) to z=9; or 3) more likely, a hybrid\nsolution in which undetected galaxies contribute significantly and f_esc\nincreases more modestly. Models in which star formation is strongly suppressed\nin low-mass, reionization-epoch haloes of mass up to ~10^10 M_sun (e.g., owing\nto a metallicity dependence) are only allowed for extreme assumptions for the\nevolution of f_esc. However, variants of such models in which the suppression\nmass is reduced (e.g., assuming an earlier or higher metallicity floor) are in\nbetter agreement with the data. Concordance scenarios satisfying the available\ndata predict a consistent redshift of 50% ionized fraction z_reion(50%) ~ 10.\nOn the other hand, the duration of reionization is sensitive to the relative\ncontribution of bright versus faint galaxies, with scenarios dominated by faint\ngalaxies predicting a more extended reionization event.

The appropriate kinetic description for these systems is the Vlasov\nequation. A numerical simulation tool for the Vlasov equation is developed.\n  A detailed study of the out-of-equilibrium phase transition occuring in the\nFree-Electron Laser is performed and the transition is analyzed with the help\nof Lynden-Bell's theory.\n  Then, the presence of stretching and folding in phase space for the\nHamiltonian Mean-Field model is studied and quantified from the point of view\nof fluid dynamics. Finally, a system of uncoupled pendula for which the\nasymptotic states are similar to the ones of the Hamiltonian Mean-Field model\nis introduced. Its asymptotic evolution is predicted via both Lynden-Bell's\ntheory and an exact computation. This system displays a fast initial evolution\nsimilar to the violent relaxation found for interacting systems.

This first\npaper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations, processing of\nthe photometry and spectrophotometry.

Our unique\nmethodology for analyzing low-dispersion spectra taken with multilayer prisms\nin IMACS, combined with panchromatic photometry from the ultraviolet to the IR,\nhas yielded 37,000 high quality redshifts in our first 5.3 sq.degs of the SWIRE\nXMM-LSS field. We use three different approaches to estimate our redshift\nerrors and find robust agreement. Over the full range of 3.6micron fluxes of\nour selection, we find typical uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) < 0.015. In\ncomparisons with previously published VVDS redshifts, for example, we find a\nscatter of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.012 for galaxies at 0.8< z< 1.2. For galaxies\nbrighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.009 and\nsigma_z/(1+z) = 0.025, respectively. Notably, our low-dispersion spectroscopy\nand analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates for\nboth red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based systematics that\ncan seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 22:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-05"}

The seemingly similar and\nvalence-iso-electronic LiNa4- and LiK4- clusters adopt very different global\nminimum structures: LiNa4- is a planar C2v (1A1) species distorted from the\nperfect pentagon due to the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, and LiK4- is a planar\nsquare D4h (1A1g) species with Li being in the centre. This effect is rooted in\nthe different degrees of the 2s-2p hybridization in Li in response to binding\nto Na versus K. Li inside the Na cluster exhibits a strong 2s-2p mixing, to\nachieve stronger covalent bonding. In contrast, Li inside of the K cluster does\nnot show any hybridization, and the LiK4- cluster is reminiscent of an ionic\nsalt. These differences are tied to the relative electronegativities of Li, Na,\nand K, and overlap of the valence atomic orbitals of Li with those of Na versus\nthose of K. Atomic orbital hybridization is thus a pronounced effect in\nclusters, the understanding of which is important for the use of clusters in\nmaterial science or catalysis, and designing clusters of desired shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 23:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 05:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-03"}

The\ncorresponding equations include those controlling infinitesimal automorphisms,\nhigher symmetries, and many other widely studied PDE of geometric origin. The\nmachinery of BGG sequences also singles out a subclass of solutions called\nnormal solutions. These correspond to parallel tractor fields and hence to\n(certain) holonomy reductions of the canonical normal Cartan connection. Using\nthe normal Cartan connection, we define a special class of local frames for any\nnatural vector bundle associated to a parabolic geometry. We then prove that\nthe coefficient functions of any normal solution of a first BGG operator with\nrespect to such a frame are polynomials in the normal coordinates of the\nparabolic geometry. A bound on the degree of these polynomials in terms of\nrepresentation theory data is derived. For geometries locally isomorphic to the\nhomogeneous model of the geometry we explicitly compute the local frames\nmentioned above. Together with the fact that on such structures all solutions\nare normal, we obtain a complete description of all first BGG solutions in this\ncase. Finally, we prove that in the general case the polynominal system coming\nfrom a normal solution is the pull-back of a polynomial system that solves the\ncorresponding problem on the homogeneous model. Thus we can derive a complete\nlist of potential normal solutions on curved geometries. Morover, questions\nconcerning the zero locus of solutions, as well as related finer geometric and\nsmooth data, are reduced to a study of polynomial systems and real algebraic\nsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 00:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 07:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-02"}

When the system is helically kinetically forced\n(KF), the growth of the large scale helical field is accompanied by growth of\nsmall scale magnetic (and current) helicity which ultimately quench the LSD.\nHere, using both simulations and theory, we study the complementary\nmagnetically forced(MF) case in which the system is forced with an electric\nfield that supplies magnetic helicity. For this MF case, the kinetic helicity\nbecomes the back-reactor that saturates the LSD. Simulations of both MF and KF\ncases can be approximately modeled with the same equations of magnetic helicity\nevolution, but with complementary initial conditions. A key difference between\nKF and MF cases is that the helical large scale field in the MF case grows with\nthe same sign of injected magnetic helicity, whereas the large and small scale\nmagnetic helicities grow with opposite sign for the KF case. The MF case can\narise even when the thermal pressure is approximately smaller than the magnetic\npressure, and requires only that helical small scale magnetic fluctuations\ndominate helical velocity fluctuations in LSD driving.

The disturbance originates in front of erupting coronal loops and\nsome sharp fronts undergo accelerations, both effects implying that the\ndisturbance is driven by a CME. The diffuse pulse, propagating at a uniform\nvelocity of 204-238 km/s with very little angular dependence within its extent\nin the south, maintains its coherence and stable profile for ~30 minutes. Its\narrival at increasing distances coincides with the onsets of loop expansions\nand the slow sharp front. The fast sharp front overtakes the slow front,\nproducing multiple \"ripples\" and steepening the local pulse, and both fronts\npropagate independently afterwards. This behavior resembles the nature of real\nwaves. Unexpectedly, the amplitude and FWHM of the diffuse pulse decrease\nlinearly with distance. A hybrid model, combining both wave and non-wave\ncomponents, can explain many, but not all, of the observations.

We extend this approach to an Accumulate-Compute and Forward\nprotocol which employs two phases: Multiple Access (MA) phase consisting of two\nchannel uses with independent messages in each channel use, and Broadcast (BC)\nphase having one channel use. Assuming that the two users transmit points from\nthe same 4-PSK constellation, every such network coding map that satisfies the\nexclusive law can be represented by a Latin Square with side 16, and\nconversely, this relationship can be used to get the network coding maps\nsatisfying the exclusive law. Two methods of obtaining this network coding map\nto be used at the relay are discussed. Using the structural properties of the\nLatin Squares for a given set of parameters, the problem of finding all the\nrequired maps is reduced to finding a small set of maps. Having obtained all\nthe Latin Squares, the set of all possible channel realizations is quantized,\ndepending on which one of the Latin Squares obtained optimizes the performance.\nThe quantization thus obtained, is shown to be the same as the one obtained in\n[7] for the 2-stage bidirectional relaying.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 06:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-05"}

We discover two new young clusters in the NGC 6357 complex.\nWe give a revised distance estimate for Pismis 24 of 1.7+-0.2 kpc. We find that\nthe massive star Pis 24-18 is a binary system, with the secondary being the\nmain X-ray source of the pair. We derive the cluster mass function and find\nthat up to the completeness limit at low masses it agrees well with the IMF of\nthe Trapezium cluster.

In all cases the proplyd tails are pointing\ndirectly away from the massive star system Pis 24-1. One proplyd shows a second\ntail, pointing away from Pis 24-2, suggesting this object is being\nphotoevaporated from two directions simultaneously. We find that the global\ndisk frequency (~30%) in Pismis 24 is much lower than some other clusters of\nsimilar age, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. When comparing the disk\nfrequencies in 19 clusters/star-forming regions of various ages and different\n(massive) star content, we find that the disks in clusters harboring extremely\nmassive stars (typically earlier than O5), like Pismis 24, are dissipated\nroughly twice as quickly as in clusters/star-forming regions without extremely\nmassive stars. Within Pismis 24, we find that the disk frequency within a\nprojected distance of 0.6 pc from Pis 24-1 is substantially lower than at\nlarger radii (~19% vs. ~37%).

Depending on the type of constraints that we allow in\nthe input, a CSP might be tractable, or computationally hard. In recent years,\ngeneral criteria have been discovered that imply that a CSP is polynomial-time\ntractable, or that it is NP-hard. Finite-domain CSPs have become a major common\nresearch focus of graph theory, artificial intelligence, and finite model\ntheory. It turned out that the key questions for complexity classification of\nCSPs are closely linked to central questions in universal algebra.\n  This thesis studies CSPs where the variables can take values from an infinite\ndomain. This generalization enhances dramatically the range of computational\nproblems that can be modeled as a CSP. Many problems from areas that have so\nfar seen no interaction with constraint satisfaction theory can be formulated\nusing infinite domains, e.g. problems from temporal and spatial reasoning,\nphylogenetic reconstruction, and operations research.\n  It turns out that the universal-algebraic approach can also be applied to\nstudy large classes of infinite-domain CSPs, yielding elegant complexity\nclassification results. A new tool in this thesis that becomes relevant\nparticularly for infinite domains is Ramsey theory. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our approach with two complete complexity classification\nresults: one on CSPs in temporal reasoning, the other on a generalization of\nSchaefer's theorem for propositional logic to logic over graphs.

Moreover, under the condition without\nthe sand supply from windward ground, the destabilization of transverse dune in\nthis model qualitatively corresponds to the subaqueous dunes in water tank\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 10:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 13:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

The mass ratio of the\nprogenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of Slow Rotators in\nbinary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the progenitor\ngalaxies with respect to the orbital angular momentum. The importance of the\ninitial spin of the progenitors is also investigated in the library of galaxy\nmergers of the GalMer project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 12:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-05"}

These\nprocesses are represented by quantum Markov chains over the common state space.\nAn execution of a nondeterministic quantum program is modeled by a sequence of\nactions of individual processes. These actions are described by super-operators\non the state Hilbert space. At each step of an execution, a process is chosen\nnondeterministically to perform the next action. A characterization of\nreachable space and a characterization of diverging states of a\nnondeterministic quantum program are presented.

Unfortunately the modification was\nnumerically not as stable as desired and it was still unclear, if the extension\nwould work for all thinkable cases. Hence a systematic derivation of a more\ngeneral treatment seemed advisable.\n  In a second paper the author suggested the use of real Dirac matrices as\nbasic tools to coupled linear optics and gave a straightforward recipe to\ndecouple positive definite Hamiltonians with imaginary eigenvalues. In this\narticle this method is generalized and simplified in order to formulate a\nstraightforward method to decouple Hamiltonian matrices with eigenvalues on the\nreal and the imaginary axis.

For their assessment, as a rule short term\nconcentrations have to be determined instead of long term mean values. This is\nalso the case for the perception of odour. Regulatory dispersion models like\nAUSTAL2000 calculate long term mean concentration values (one-hour), but\nprovide no information on the fluctuation from this mean. The ratio between a\nshort term mean value (relevant for odour perception) and the long term mean\nvalue (calculated by the dispersion model), called the peak-to-mean value, is\nusually used to describe these fluctuations. In general, this ratio can be\ndefined in different ways. M\\\"uller et al. (2012), in a comment to Schauberger\net al. (2012) which includes a statement that AUSTAL2000 uses a constant factor\nof 4, argue that AUSTAL2000 does not apply a peak-to-mean factor and does not\ncalculate odour exceedance probabilities. Instead it calculates the frequency\nof so-called odour-hours by applying the relation between the 90-percentile of\nthe instantaneous concentration and the hourly mean (Janicke and Janicke,\n2007a), not between some peak value and the mean. According to Janicke and\nJanicke (2007a), the 90-percentile of the instantaneous concentration can in\npractice be estimated with sufficient accuracy from the hourly mean by using a\nfactor of 4. Having so far replied to M\\\"uller et al. (2012) we take\nadditionally the opportunity to elaborate a little more on the peak-to-mean\nconcept, especially pointing out that a constant factor independent of the\nstability of the atmosphere, the distance from and the geometry of the source,\nis not appropriate. On the contrary it shows a sophisticated structure which\ncannot be described by only one single value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 15:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-05"}

The specimen is placed between the working mass (front\npart of the bar) and backing part of the bar, which is captured in flight by\nspecial brake. When the back part of the flying split bar is stopped, the\nworking mass continues the flight by inertia, creating specimen tension with\nstrain rate depending on the length of specimen and velocity of flying bar.\nProperly choosing the working mass and the speed of the flying bar, one can\ntune maximal stress and strain rate over a wide range.

Contrary to tensile SHPB, the method provides a\nway to investigate materials with practically arbitrary strain to failure.

This is demonstrated by the\ncellular dynamical mean-field theory for a spin-ice type Kondo lattice model on\na pyrochlore lattice. Peculiar temperature dependences of the resistivity,\nspecific heat, and magnetic susceptibility in the non-Kondo mechanism are\ncompared with the experimental data in metallic Ir pyrochlore oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2012 15:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2012 12:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The Efimov effect, once considered a mysterious and esoteric\neffect, is today a reality that many experiments in ultracold quantum gases\nhave successfully observed and continued to explore [2-14]. Whereas theory was\nthe driving force behind our understanding of Efimov physics for decades,\nrecent experiments have contributed an unexpected discovery. Specifically,\nmeasurements have found that the so-called three-body parameter determining\nseveral properties of the system is universal, even though fundamental\nassumptions in the theory of the Efimov effect suggest that it should be a\nvariable property that depends on the precise details of the short-range two-\nand three-body interactions. The present Letter resolves this apparent\ncontradiction by elucidating unanticipated implications of the two-body\ninteractions. Our study shows that the three-body parameter universality\nemerges because a universal effective barrier in the three-body potentials\nprevents the three particles from simultaneously getting close to each other.\nOur results also show limitations on this universality, as it is more likely to\noccur for neutral atoms and less likely to extend to light nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2012 23:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 22:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Inversely the Minkowski spacetime is\nistantiated by the Weyl spinors, while the merge of two Weyl spinors gives rise\nto a Dirac spinor. Our analysis is applied also to the string geometry. The\nstring constraints are represented by real spinors, which create a\nparametrization of the string worldsheet identical to the Enneper-Weierstass\nrepresentation of minimal surfaces. Further, a spinorial study of the AdS3\nspacetime reveals a Hopf fibration AdS3 \\rightarrow AdS2. The conformal\nsymmetry inherent in AdS3 is pointed out.
