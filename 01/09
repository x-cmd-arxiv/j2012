We will concetrate specially on one aspect of this possible equivalence,\nnamely whether the static black hole uniqueness theorems extend to static\nspacetimes containing marginally outer trapped surfaces. The principal result\nof this thesis states that this question has an affirmative answer, under\nsuitable not global-in-time conditions on the spacetime. Furthermore, in order\nto solve this question, we will obtain several results which generalize known\nproperties of static spacetimes to the initial data setting and can be of\nindependent interest. Finally, we will study the Penrose inequality in static\ninitial data which are not time-symmetric. Our main result in this last part of\nthe thesis is the discovery of a counter-example of a recent version of the\nPenrose inequality proposed by Bray and Khuri in 2009.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2012 16:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

We\nbuilt two composite groups at intermediate (0.2 <= z <= 0.45) and high (0.45 <\nz <= 0.8) redshifts, and we divided the corresponding composite group galaxies\ninto three samples according to their distance from the group center. We\nexplored how galaxy stellar masses and colors - working in narrow bins of\nstellar masses - vary as a function of the galaxy distance from the group\ncenter. We found that the most massive galaxies in our sample (Log(M_gal/M_sun)\n>= 10.6) do not display any strong group-centric dependence of the fractions of\nred/blue objects. For galaxies of lower masses (9.8 <= Log(M_gal/M_sun) <=\n10.6) there is a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and blue\ngalaxies. This dependence is most evident in poor groups, whereas richer groups\ndo not display any obvious trend of the blue fraction. Interestingly, mass\nsegregation shows the opposite behavior: it is visible only in rich groups,\nwhile poorer groups have a a constant mix of galaxy stellar masses as a\nfunction of radius. We suggest a simple scenario where color- and\nmass-segregation originate from different physical processes. While dynamical\nfriction is the obvious cause for establishing mass segregation, both\nstarvation and galaxy-galaxy collisions are plausible mechanisms to quench star\nformation in groups at a faster rate than in the field.

The\nnodes in these networks correspond to individuals who are self-interested. The\ntopology of these networks often plays a crucial role in deciding the ease and\nspeed with which certain tasks can be accomplished using these networks.\nConsequently, growing a stable network having a certain topology is of\ninterest. Motivated by this, we study the following important problem: given a\ncertain desired network topology, under what conditions would best response\n(link addition/deletion) strategies played by self-interested agents lead to\nformation of a pairwise stable network with only that topology. We study this\ninteresting reverse engineering problem by proposing a natural model of\nrecursive network formation.

We find that X-ray timing\nsignatures are the best diagnostic of the jet ejection event in this outburst,\nwhich occurred as the X-ray variability began to decrease and the Type C\nquasi-periodic oscillations disappeared from the X-ray power density spectrum.\nHowever, this sequence of events does not appear to be replicated in all black\nhole X-ray binary outbursts, even within an individual source. In our\nobservations of H1743-322, the ejection was contemporaneous with a quenching of\nthe radio emission, prior to the start of the major radio flare. This\ncontradicts previous assumptions that the onset of the radio flare marks the\nmoment of ejection. The jet speed appears to vary between outbursts, with a\npossible positive correlation with outburst luminosity. The compact core radio\njet reactivated on transition to the hard intermediate state at the end of the\noutburst, and not when the source reached the low hard spectral state.\nComparison with the known near-infrared behaviour of the compact jets suggests\na gradual evolution of the compact jet power over a few days near the beginning\nand end of an outburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 02:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Here we examine the apparent radius in a\nhomogeneous sample of long, mixed H/He bursts from the low-mass X-ray binaries\nGS 1826-24 and KS 1731-26. The measured blackbody normalisation (proportional\nto the emitting area) in these bursts is constant over a period of up to 60s in\nthe burst tail, even though the flux (blackbody temperature) decreased by a\nfactor of 60-75% (30-40%). The typical rms variation in the mean normalisation\nfrom burst to burst was 3-5%, although a variation of 17% was found between\nbursts observed from GS 1826-24 in two epochs. A comparison of the\ntime-resolved spectroscopic measurements during bursts from the two epochs\nshows that the normalisation evolves consistently through the burst rise and\npeak, but subsequently increases further in the earlier epoch bursts. The\nelevated normalisation values may arise from a change in the anisotropy of the\nburst emission, or alternatively variations in the spectral correction factor,\nf_c, of order 10%. Since burst samples observed from systems other than GS\n1826-24 are more heterogeneous, we expect that systematic uncertainties of at\nleast 10% are likely to apply generally to measurements of neutron-star radii,\nunless the effects described here can be corrected for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 02:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In response to this,\nmany energy-aware scheduling algorithms have been developed primarily using the\ndynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) capability which has been incorporated\ninto recent commodity processors. Majority of these algorithms involve two\npasses: schedule generation and slack reclamation. The former pass involves the\nredistribution of tasks among DVFS-enabled processors based on a given cost\nfunction that includes makespan and energy consumption; and, while the latter\npass is typically achieved by executing individual tasks with slacks at a lower\nprocessor frequency. In this paper, a new slack reclamation algorithm is\nproposed by approaching the energy reduction problem from a different angle.\nFirstly, the problem of task slack reclamation by using combinations of\nprocessors' frequencies is formulated. Secondly, several proofs are provided to\nshow that (1) if the working frequency set of processor is assumed to be\ncontinues, the optimal energy will be always achieved by using only one\nfrequency, (2) for real processors with a discrete set of working frequencies,\nthe optimal energy is always achieved by using at most two frequencies, and (3)\nthese two frequencies are adjacent/neighbouring when processor energy\nconsumption is a convex function of frequency. Thirdly, a novel algorithm to\nfind the best combination of frequencies to result the optimal energy is\npresented. The presented algorithm has been evaluated based on results obtained\nfrom experiments with three different sets of task graphs: 3000 randomly\ngenerated task graphs, and 600 task graphs for two popular applications\n(Gauss-Jordan and LU decomposition). The results show the superiority of the\nproposed algorithm in comparison with other techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 06:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}

In the concordance model of\ncosmology, these contradictions are removed or alleviated by the introduction\nof three completely independent new components of stress-energy -- the\ninflaton, dark matter, and dark energy. Each of these in its turn is meant to\nhave (or to currently) dominate the dynamics of the universe. There is still no\nnon-gravitational evidence for any of these dark sectors; nor for the required\nextensions of the standard model. An alternative is to imagine that GR itself\nmust be modified. Certain coincidences of scale even suggest that one might\nexpect not to have to make three independent. Because they must address the\nmost different types of data, attempts to replace dark matter with modified\ngravity are the most controversial. A phenomenological model (or family of\nmodels), Modified Newtonian Dynamics, has, over the last few years seen several\ncovariant realizations. We discuss a number of challenges that any model that\nseeks to replace dark matter with modified gravity must face: the loss of\nBirkhoff's Theorem, and the calculational simplifications it implies; the\nfailure to explain clusters, whether static or interacting, and the consequent\nneed to introduce dark matter of some form, whether hot dark matter neutrinos,\nor dark fields that arise in new sectors of the modified gravity theory; the\nintrusion of cosmological expansion into the modified force law, that arises\nprecisely because of the coincidence in scale between the centripetal\nacceleration at which Newtonian gravity fails in galaxies, and the cosmic\nacceleration. We conclude with the observation that, although modified gravity\nmay indeed manage to replace dark matter, it is likely to do so by becoming or\nincorporating, a dark matter theory itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 06:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-10"}

Of the emission mechanisms discussed above, scattered continuum\nprovides the simplest explanation for the observed linear correlation. In this\ncase, the color variation within each object is attributed to different\nforeground extinctions at different positions. Alternative possible emission\nmechanisms to explain this correlation may be a combination of thermal and\nfluorescent H2 emission in shocks, and a combination of scattered continuum and\nthermal H2 emission, but detailed models or spectroscopic follow-up are\nrequired to further investigate this possibility.

Then we consider scenarios in which the number density or\nthe slope of the LFs are assumed to vary with redshift. After comparison with\navailable data we conclude that a pure luminosity evolution does not provide a\ngood fit to the data, especially at very high redshift, although many\nuncertainties are still present in the data. On the other hand, a variation in\nthe number density of ellipticals and spirals as a function of redshift can\nprovide a better fit to the observed CSFR. We also explore cases of variable\nslope of the LFs with redshift and variations of number density and slope at\nthe same time.

We explain why some\nmodels meet the classical gravitational tests, while others do not. We show\nthat variation of the total volume of the internal spaces generates the fifth\nforce. This is the main reason of the problem. It happens for all considered\nmodels (linear with respect to the scalar curvature and nonlinear $f(R)$, with\ntoroidal and spherical compactifications). We explicitly single out the\ncontribution of the fifth force to nonrelativistic gravitational potentials. In\nthe case of models with toroidal compactification, we demonstrate how tension\n(with and without effects of nonlinearity) of the gravitating source can fix\nthe total volume of the internal space, resulting in the vanishing fifth force\nand consequently in agreement with the observations. It takes place for latent\nsolitons, black strings and black branes. We also demonstrate a particular\nexample where non-vanishing variations of the internal space volume do not\ncontradict the gravitational experiments. In the case of spherical\ncompactification, the fifth force is replaced by the Yukawa interaction for\nmodels with the stabilized internal space. For large Yukawa masses, the effect\nof this interaction is negligibly small, and considered models satisfy the\ngravitational tests at the same level of accuracy as general relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 13:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2012 09:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

An important\nquantity to this analysis is the three-dimensional Green function associated\nwith this system. For both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions obeyed by\nthe scalar field on the sphere, the Green function presents a structure that\ncontains contributions due to the background geometry of the spacetime and the\nboundary. Consequently the corresponding induced scalar self-energy present\nalso similar structure. For points near the sphere the boundary-induced part\ndominates and the self-force is repulsive/attractive with respect to the\nboundary for Dirichlet/Neumann boundary condition. In the region outside the\nsphere at large distances from it, the boundary-free part in the self-energy\ndominates and the corresponding self-force can be either attractive or\nrepulsive with dependence of the curvature coupling parameter for scalar field.\nIn particular, for the minimal coupling we show the presence of a stable\nequilibrium point for Dirichlet boundary condition.

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 14:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 15:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

It has been recently proposed theoretically and verified\nexperimentally that the long-time behavior of single-crystal FIDs has the\nuniversal form of exponentially decaying sinusoidal oscillations.\nPolycrystalline averaging complicates the situation theoretically, while the\navailable experimental evidence is also ambiguous. Exponentially decaying\nsinusoidal oscillations have been observed for Xe-129 in polycrystalline solid\nxenon but not for F-19 in the powder of CaF2. In this paper, we present the\nfirst principles FID calculations for the powders of both CaF2 and solid xenon.\nIn both cases, the asymptotic long-time behavior has the expected form of\nexponentially decaying sinusoidal oscillations, which is determined by the\nsingle crystallite FID with the slowest exponential decay. However, this\nbehavior appears only at rather small values of the signal that have not yet\nbeen measured in experiments. At intermediate times accessible experimentally,\na polycrystalline FID depends on the distribution of the exponential decay\nconstants and oscillation frequencies for single crystallite FIDs. In CaF2,\nthese parameters are relatively broadly distributed, and as a result, the\nsinusoidal long-time oscillations become somewhat washed out. In contrast, the\nsingle crystallite parameters are more clustered in solid xenon, and, as a\nresult, the experimentally observable range is characterized by well-defined\noscillation frequency and exponential decay constant even though both of these\nparameters do not represent the true long-time behavior. The above difference\nof the intermediate FID behavior originates from the difference of the crystal\nstructures of solid xenon and CaF2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 15:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Implementing a flow model we are able to reproduce the measured\noverspill evolution providing a tool for catastrophe mitigation and future\nplanning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 15:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-15"}
