From the cooling process we\nfound that a solid quark-cluster star, which has a stiffer equation of state\nthan that of conventional liquid quark star, has a heat capacity much smaller\nthan a neutron star. It can cool down quickly, which can naturally explain the\nnon-detection of a point source (neutron star or quark star) in X-ray band. On\nthe other hand, we consider the heating process from magnetospheric activity\nand possible accretion, and obtain some constraints to the parameters of a\npossible pulsar. We conclude that a solid quark-cluster star can be fine with\nthe observational limit in a large and acceptable parameter space. A pulsar\nwith a short period and a strong magnetic field (or with a long period and a\nweak field) would has luminosity higher than the luminosity limit if the\noptical depth is not large enough to hide the compact star.

First, we prove that in multiple-input single-output\n(MISO) channels, the optimum transmission strategy maximizing the throughput is\nto use all available antennas and perform equal power allocation with\nuncorrelated signals. Furthermore, to increase the expected-rate, multi-layer\ncoding is applied.

Such behavior is encoded by\nthe monoid C(R) of isomorphism classes of maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules: the\nstructure of this monoid reveals, for example, whether or not every maximal\nCohen-Macaulay module is uniquely a direct sum of indecomposable modules; when\nuniqueness does not hold, invariants of this monoid give a measure of how badly\nthis property fails. The key to understanding the monoid C(R) is determining\nthe ranks of indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules. Our main technical\nresult shows that if R/P_1 has infinite Cohen-Macaulay type and the residue\nfield k is infinite, then there exist |k| pairwise non-isomorphic\nindecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules of rank (r_1,...,r_s) provided\nr_1 is greater than or equal to r_i for all i. This result allows us to\ndescribe the monoid C(R) when all analytic branches of R have infinite\nCohen-Macaulay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2012 00:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-17"}

The renewal process is\nknown as bone remodelling and is operated by bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts)\nand bone-forming cells (osteoblasts). Both biochemical and biomechanical\nregulatory mechanisms have been identified in the interaction between\nosteoclasts and osteoblasts. Here we focus on an additional and poorly\nunderstood potential regulatory mechanism of bone cells, that involves the\nmorphology of the microstructure of bone. Bone cells can only remove and\nreplace bone at a bone surface. However, the microscopic availability of bone\nsurface depends in turn on the ever-changing bone microstructure. The\nimportance of this geometrical dependence is unknown and difficult to quantify\nexperimentally. Therefore, we develop a sophisticated mathematical model of\nbone cell interactions that takes into account biochemical, biomechanical and\ngeometrical regulations. We then investigate numerically the influence of bone\nsurface availability in bone remodelling within a representative bone tissue\nsample. The interdependence between the bone cells' activity, which modifies\nthe bone microstructure, and changes in the microscopic bone surface\navailability, which in turn influences bone cell development and activity, is\nimplemented using a remarkable experimental relationship between bone specific\nsurface and bone porosity. Our model suggests that geometrical regulation of\nthe activation of new remodelling events could have a significant effect on\nbone porosity and bone stiffness. On the other hand, geometrical regulation of\nlate stages of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation seems less\nsignificant. We conclude that the development of osteoporosis is probably\naccelerated by this geometrical regulation in cortical bone, but probably\nslowed down in trabecular bone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2012 07:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 07:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

As a result, the thermodynamic singularity\nfor small U differs from that of the conventional two-channel Kondo problem.\nEspecially, the impurity contribution to specific heat is proportional to\ntemperature and bipolaron fluctuations, which are coupled electron-phonon\nfluctuations, diverge logarithmically at low temperatures for small U.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2012 08:56:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 01:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 04:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

To enable scheduling based on packet delays, we design a novel\nmechanism for inferring the packet delays approximately from the buffer status\nreports (BSR) transmitted by the UEs; the BSR reports only contain queue length\ninformation. We then consider a constrained optimization problem with a concave\nobjective function - schedulers such as those based on utility maximization,\nmaximum weight scheduling, and recent results on iterative scheduling for small\nqueue/delay follow as special cases. In particular, the construction of the\nnon-differentiable objective function based on packet delays is novel. We model\nconstraints on bandwidth, peak transmit power at the UE, and the transmit power\nspectral density (PSD) at the UE due to fractional power control. When\nfrequency diversity doesn't exist or is not exploited at a fast time-scale, we\nuse subgradient analysis to construct an O(N log L) (per iteration with small\nnumber of iterations) algorithm to compute the optimal resource allocation for\nN users and L points of non-differentiability in the objective function.

We have investigated the mechanism driving the X-ray\nluminosities of such galaxies by studying the X-ray emission of three moderate\nredshift (z ~ 0.1) examples of this class, selected from a cross-correlation of\nthe SDSS-DR5 and 2XMMp-DR0 catalogues.

The X-ray spectra of all three sources are\nbest fitted with a simple absorbed power-law model, thus betraying no\nsignificant signs of star formation. These results indicate that the X-ray\nemission is powered by AGN activity. But why do these sources not display\noptical AGN signatures?

For example, the Thue-Morse sequence is obtained by the\n`zip-specification' {M = 0 : X, X = 1 : zip(X,Y), Y = 0 : zip(Y,X)}. Our\nanalysis of such systems employs both term rewriting and coalgebraic\ntechniques. We establish decidability for these zip-specifications, employing\nbisimilarity of observation graphs based on a suitably chosen cobasis. The\nimportance of zip-specifications resides in their intimate connection with\nautomatic sequences. We establish a new and simple characterization of\nautomatic sequences. Thus we obtain for the binary zip that a stream is\n2-automatic iff its observation graph using the cobasis (hd,even,odd) is\nfinite. The generalization to zip-k specifications and their relation to\nk-automaticity is straightforward. In fact, zip-specifications can be perceived\nas a term rewriting syntax for automatic sequences. Our study of\nzip-specifications is placed in an even wider perspective by employing the\nobservation graphs in a dynamic logic setting, leading to an alternative\ncharacterization of automatic sequences. We further obtain a natural extension\nof the class of automatic sequences, obtained by `zip-mix' specifications that\nuse zips of different arities in one specification. We also show that\nequivalence is undecidable for a simple extension of the zip-mix format with\nprojections like even and odd. However, it remains open whether zip-mix\nspecifications have a decidable equivalence problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2012 13:29:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 11:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}
