The proposed model assumes that the climate is\nresonating with, or synchronized to a set of natural harmonics that have been\nassociated to the solar system planetary motion, mostly determined by Jupiter\nand Saturn. We show that the GCMs fail to reproduce the major decadal and\nmultidecadal oscillations found in the global surface temperature record from\n1850 to 2011. On the contrary, the proposed harmonic model is found to well\nreconstruct the observed climate oscillations from 1850 to 2011, and it is able\nto forecast the climate oscillations from 1950 to 2011 using the data covering\nthe period 1850-1950, and vice versa. The 9.1-year cycle is shown to be likely\nrelated to a decadal Soli/Lunar tidal oscillation, while the 10-10.5, 20-21 and\n60-62 year cycles are synchronous to solar and heliospheric planetary\noscillations. Finally, we show how the presence of these large natural cycles\ncan be used to correct the IPCC projected anthropogenic warming trend for the\n21st century. By combining this corrected trend with the natural cycles, we\nshow that the temperature may not significantly increase during the next 30\nyears mostly because of the negative phase of the 60-year cycle. The same IPCC\nprojected anthropogenic emissions would imply a global warming by about 0.3-1.2\nK by 2100, contrary to the IPCC 1.0-3.6 K projected warming. The results of\nthis paper reinforce previous claims that the relevant physical mechanisms that\nexplain the detected climatic cycles are still missing in the current GCMs and\nthat climate variations at the multidecadal scales are astronomically induced\nand, in first approximation, can be forecast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 18:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-09"}

These disks are observed around stars with\ndifferent spectral types, and there are indications that the disks around lower\nmass stars are significantly flatter, which could indicate that they settle and\nevolve faster, or in a different way.\n  We aim to test this assumption by modeling the median spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of three samples of protoplanetary disks: around Herbig\nstars, T Tauri stars and brown dwarfs. We focus on the turbulent mixing\nstrength to avoid a strong observational bias from disk and stellar properties\nthat depend on stellar mass.\n  We generated SEDs with the radiative transfer code MCMax, using a hydrostatic\ndisk structure and settling the dust in a self-consistent way with the\nalpha-prescription to probe the turbulent mixing strength.\n  We are able to fit all three samples with a disk with the same input\nparameters, scaling the inner edge to the dust evaporation radius and disk mass\nto millimeter photometry. The Herbig stars require a special treatment for the\ninner rim regions, while the T-Tauri stars require viscous heating, and the\nbrown dwarfs lack a good estimate of the disk mass because only few millimeter\ndetections exist.\n  We find that the turbulent mixing strength does not vary across the stellar\nmass range for a fixed grain size distribution and gas-to-dust ratio. Regions\nwith the same temperature have a self-similar vertical structure independent of\nstellar mass, but regions at the same distance from the central star appear\nmore settled in disks around lower mass stars. We find a relatively low\nturbulent mixing strength of alpha = 10^(-4) for a standard grain size\ndistribution, but our results are also consistent with alpha = 0.01 for a grain\nsize distribution with fewer small grains or a lower gas-to-dust ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 17:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The method is easy to implement algorithmically and may\nfind applications for adaptive online control of biological and engineering\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 17:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-10"}

Regular isostatic networks have finite moduli in the\nlimit of large sizes. However, numerical simulations show that all elastic\nmoduli of geometrically disordered isostatic networks go to zero with system\nsize. This holds true for positional as well as for topological disorder. In\nmost cases, elastic moduli decrease as inverse power-laws of system size. On\ndirected isostatic networks, however, of which the square and cubic lattices\nare particular cases, the decrease of the moduli is exponential with size. For\nthese, the observed elastic weakening can be quantitatively described in terms\nof the multiplicative growth of stresses with system size, giving rise to bulk\nand shear moduli of order exp{-bL}. The case of sphere packings, which only\naccept compressive contact forces, is considered separately. It is argued that\nthese have a finite bulk modulus because of specific correlations in contact\ndisorder, introduced by the constraint of compressivity. We discuss why their\nshear modulus, nevertheless, is again zero for large sizes. A quantitative\nmodel is proposed that describes the numerically measured shear modulus, both\nas a function of the loading angle and system size. In all cases, if a density\np>0 of overconstraints is present, as when a packing is deformed by\ncompression, or when a glass is outside its isostatic composition window, all\nasymptotic moduli become finite. For square networks with periodic boundary\nconditions, these are of order sqrt{p}. For directed networks, elastic moduli\nare of order exp{-c/p}, indicating the existence of an \"isostatic length scale\"\nof order 1/p.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 17:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The comparison between dynamical models and observations\nis performed by fitting simultaneously surface brightness and velocity\ndispersion profiles.

A kew point in the development\nof the formalism is to build an action that is manifestly invariant with\nrespect to Weyl transformations. When this action is expressed in terms of\nRiemannian geometry we find that the theory has some similarities with\nBrans-Dicke gravitational theory. In this scenario, the gravitational field is\nnot described by the metric tensor only, but by a combination of both the\nmetric and a geometrical scalar field. We illustrate this point by, firstly,\ndiscussing the Newtonian limit in an arbitrary frame, and, secondly, by\nexamining how distinct geometrical and physical pictures of the same phenomena\nmay arise in different frames. To give an example, we discuss the gravitational\nspectral shift as viewed in a general Weyl frame.

A distinct loop top (LT) coronal source is detected up\nto ~150 keV and a second (upper) coronal source up to ~80 keV. These photon\nenergies are much higher than commonly observed in coronal sources and pose\ngrave modeling challenges. The LT source in general appears higher in altitude\nwith increasing energy and exhibits a more limited motion compared to the\nexpansion of the thermal loop. The high energy LT source shows an impulsive\ntime profile and its nonthermal power law spectrum exhibits soft-hard-soft\nevolution during the impulsive phase, similar to the FP sources. The upper\ncoronal source exhibits an opposite spatial gradient and a similar spectral\nslope compared to the LT source. These properties are consistent with the model\nof stochastic acceleration of electrons by plasma waves or turbulence. However,\nthe LT and FP spectral index difference (varying from ~0-1) is much smaller\nthan commonly measured and than that expected from a simple stochastic\nacceleration model.

Recently, this term has been applied disparately\nto objects whose Spitzer SEDs diverge from the expectations for a typical full\ndisk. Here we use irradiated accretion disk models to fit the SEDs of 15 such\ndisks in NGC 2068 and IC 348. One group has a \"dip\" in infrared emission while\nthe others' continuum emission decreases steadily at all wavelengths. We find\nthat the former have an inner disk hole or gap at intermediate radii in the\ndisk and we call these objects \"transitional\" and pre-transitional\" disks,\nrespectively. For the latter group, we can fit these SEDs with full disk models\nand find that millimeter data are necessary to break the degeneracy between\ndust settling and disk mass. We suggest the term \"transitional\" only be applied\nto objects that display evidence for a radical change in the disk's radial\nstructure. Using this definition, we find that transitional and\npre-transitional disks tend to have lower mass accretion rates than full disks\nand that transitional disks have lower accretion rates than pre-transitional\ndisks. These reduced accretion rates onto the star could be linked to forming\nplanets. Future observations of transitional and pre-transitional disks will\nallow us to better quantify the signatures of planet formation in young disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2012 23:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Many\nauthors have discussed techniques to excise or mitigate RFI in searches for\nfast transients, but comparisons between different approaches are lacking. This\nwork develops RFI mitigation techniques for use in searches for dispersed\npulses, employing data recorded in a \"Fly's Eye\" mode of the Allen Telescope\nArray as a test case. We gauge the performance of several RFI mitigation\ntechniques by adding dispersed signals to data containing RFI and comparing\nfalse alarm rates at the observed signal-to-noise ratios of the added signals.\nWe find that Huber filtering is most effective at removing broadband\ninterferers, while frequency centering is most effective at removing narrow\nfrequency interferers. Neither of these methods is effective over a broad range\nof interferers. A method that combines Huber filtering and adaptive\ninterference cancellation provides the lowest number of false positives over\nthe interferers considered here.

It is natural to ask whether such a structure is sufficiently stable\nagainst external disturbance. The mass spectra of the ground states of the\nscalar and axial-vector diquarks which are composed of two-light (L-L),\none-light-one-heavy (H-L) and two-heavy quarks (H-H) respectively have been\ncalculated in terms of the QCD sum rules. We suggest a criterion as the\nquantitative standard for the stability of the diquark. It is the gap between\nthe masses of the diquark and $\\sqrt{s_0}$ where $s_0$ is the threshold of the\nexcited states and continuity, namely the larger the gap is, the more stable\nthe diquark would be. In this work, we calculate the masses of the type H-H to\ncomplete the series of the spectra of the ground state diquarks. However, as\nthe criterion being taken, we find that all the gaps for the various diquaks\nare within a small range, especially the gap for the diquark with two heavy\nquarks which is believed to be a stable structure, is slightly smaller than\nthat for other two types of diquarks, therefore we conclude that because of the\nlarge theoretical uncertainty, we cannot use the numerical results obtained\nwith the QCD sum rules to assess the stability of diquarks, but need to invoke\nother theoretical framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2012 06:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

When using clusters for cosmology,\nthe crucial assumption is that they are relaxed.

Our results suggest that the SZ\npeak coincides with the peak in the pressure times the line-of-sight\ncharacteristic length and not the pressure maximum (as it would for clusters in\nequilibrium). The peak in the X-ray emission, as expected, coincides with the\ndensity maximum of the main cluster.

The indices of the power-law correlation between $w$\nand $E$ for the pulses in episode B however are larger than that in episode A.\nMoreover the pulses B1, B2 and B3 tend to be more symmetric at the higher\nenergy bands while the pulse A displays a reverse trend. (ii) Pulse A shows a\nhard-to-soft spectral evolution pattern, while the three pulses in the episode\nB follow the light curve trend. (iii) Pulse A has a longer lag than the pulses\nB1, B2 and B3. The mechanism which causes the different pulse characteristics\nwithin one single GRB is unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2012 12:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-09"}

The majority of this work has focused\non a five dimensional slice of AdS space. This thesis attempts to address the\nquestion, what possible spaces offer phenomenologically viable resolutions to\nthis gauge hierarchy problem. In order for a space to offer a potential\nresolution to the hierarchy problem two conditions must be met: Firstly one\nshould be able to demonstrate that the space can be stabilised such that a\nsmall effective electroweak scale (or large effective Planck scale) can be\nobtained. Secondly one must demonstrate that the space allows for a Kaluza\nKlein (KK) scale that is small enough such that one does not reintroduce a\nhierarchy in the effective theory. Here we focus on the second condition and\nexamine the constraints, on the KK scale, coming from corrections to\nelectroweak observables and flavour physics which arise when gauge fields\npropagate in an additional dimension. We study a large class of possible spaces\nof different geometries and dimensionalities. In five dimensions it is found\nthat such constraints are generically large. In more than five dimensions it is\nfound that a significant proportion of such spaces suffer from either a high\ndensity of KK modes or alternatively strongly coupled KK fields. The latter\nwould not offer viable resolutions to the hierarchy problem. Models in which\nthe Higgs propagates in the bulk are also studied, in the context of models\nwith a `soft wall' and it is found these have significantly reduced constraints\nfrom flavour physics as well as a notion of a minimum fermion mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2012 14:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}
