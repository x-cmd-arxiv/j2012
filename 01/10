The lack of a standard\nLagrangian/Hamiltonian formulation in the customary asymptotic approximation\nfor the RR equation may inhibit the construction of consistent kinetic and\nfluid theories. In this paper the issue is investigated in the framework of\nSpecial Relativity. It is shown that, for finite-size spherically-symmetric\nclassical charged particles, non-perturbative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian\nformulations in standard form can be obtained, which describe particle dynamics\nin the presence of the exact EM RR self-force. As a remarkable consequence,\nbased on axiomatic formulation of classical statistical mechanics, the\ncovariant kinetic theory for systems of charged particles subject to the EM RR\nself-force is formulated in Hamiltonian form. A fundamental feature is that the\nnon-local effects enter the kinetic equation only through the retarded particle\n4-position, which permits the construction of the related non-local fluid\nequations. In particular, the moment equations obtained in this way do not\ncontain higher-order moments, allowing as a consequence the adoption of\nstandard closure conditions.

In this paper it is shown that such a description can be\nconsistently obtained in the context of classical electrodynamics, for the case\nof a $N$-body system of classical finite-size charged particles. A variational\nformulation of the problem is presented, based on the $N$-body hybrid\nsynchronous Hamilton variational principle.

A key question is therefore\nthe determination of consistent equilibrium configurations for accretion-disk\nplasmas and investigation of their stability properties. In the case of\ncollisionless plasmas kinetic theory provides the appropriate theoretical\nframework. This paper presents a kinetic description of low-frequency and\nlong-wavelength axisymmetric electromagnetic perturbations in non-relativistic,\nstrongly-magnetized and gravitationally-bound axisymmetric accretion-disk\nplasmas in the collisionless regime. The analysis, carried out within the\nframework of the Vlasov-Maxwell description, relies on stationary kinetic\nsolutions of the Vlasov equation which allow for the simultaneous treatment of\nnon-uniform fluid fields, stationary accretion flows and temperature\nanisotropies. It is demonstrated that, for such solutions, no axisymmetric\nunstable perturbations can exist occurring on characteristic time and space\nscales which are long compared with the Larmor gyration time and radius. Hence,\nthese stationary configurations are actually stable against axisymmetric\nkinetic instabilities of this type. As a fundamental consequence, this rules\nout the possibility of having the axisymmetric magneto-rotational or thermal\ninstabilities to arise in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 17:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Asteroseismology offers a\npromising way to estimate stellar mean density. When combined with accurate\nradii determinations, such as is expected from GAIA, this yields accurate\nstellar masses. The main difficulty is finding the best way to extract the mean\ndensity from a set of observed frequencies.\n  We seek to establish a new method for estimating stellar mean density, which\ncombines the simplicity of a scaling law while providing the accuracy of an\ninversion technique.\n  We provide a framework in which to construct and evaluate kernel-based linear\ninversions which yield directly the mean density of a star. We then describe\nthree different inversion techniques (SOLA and two scaling laws) and apply them\nto the sun, several test cases and three stars.\n  The SOLA approach and the scaling law based on the surface correcting\ntechnique described by Kjeldsen et al. (2008) yield comparable results which\ncan reach an accuracy of 0.5 % and are better than scaling the large frequency\nseparation. The reason for this is that the averaging kernels from the two\nfirst methods are comparable in quality and are better than what is obtained\nwith the large frequency separation. It is also shown that scaling the large\nfrequency separation is more sensitive to near-surface effects, but is much\nless affected by an incorrect mode identification. As a result, one can\nidentify pulsation modes by looking for an l and n assignment which provides\nthe best agreement between the results from the large frequency separation and\nthose from one of the two other methods. Non-linear effects are also discussed\nas is the effects of mixed modes. In particular, it is shown that mixed modes\nbring little improvement as a result of their poorly adapted kernels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 17:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Instead, using our time-dependent modelling, we find\nlow density and derive firm lower limits to the distance of these components.\nComponent D shows evidence for variability on longer time scales, yielding an\nupper limit to the distance. For component E we derive an upper limit to the\ndistance based on the argument that the thickness of the absorbing layer must\nbe less than its distance to the black hole. Combining these results, at the\n90% confidence level, component C has a distance of >70 pc, component D between\n5-33 pc, and component E >5 pc but smaller than 21-400 pc, depending upon\nmodelling details. These results are consistent with the upper limits from the\nHST/COS observations of our campaign and point to an origin of the dominant,\nslow (v<1000 km/s) outflow components in the NLR or torus-region of Mrk 509.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 17:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Over\nthe last several decades, many deviations from conventional bulk\nsuperconducting behavior have been observed in ultra-narrow superconducting\nnanowires, some of which have been identified with QPS.

Hence, a unified understanding of the nature of\nQPS, and its relationship to the various observations has yet to be achieved.\nIn this paper we present a new model for QPS which takes as its starting point\nan idea originally postulated by Mooij and Nazarov [Nature Physics {\\bf 2}, 169\n(2006)]: that \\textit{flux-charge duality}, a classical symmetry of Maxwell's\nequations, can be used to relate QPS to the well-known Josephson tunneling of\nCooper pairs.

The simplest extension of the standard model known as the\ntwo-Higgs-doublet-model (2HDM) involves a second Higgs doublet. The 2HDM\npredicts the existence of five scalar particles: three neutral ($A^{0}$),\n($h^{0}$, $H^{0}$) and two charged ($H^{\\pm}$). The purpose of this work is to\ndetermine in a natural and easy way the mass eigenstates and masses of these\nfive particles, in terms of the parameters $\\lambda_{i}$ introduced in the\nminimal extended Higgs sector potential that preserves the CP symmetry. We\ndiscuss several cases of Higgs mixings and the one in which two neutral states\nare degenerate. As the values of the quartic interactions between the scalar\ndoublets are not theoretically determined, it is of great interest to explore\nand constrain their values, therefore we analize the stability and triviality\nbounds using the Lagrange multipliers method and numerically solving the\nrenormalization group equations.

The former is mostly\nrelated to the initial geometry and collective expansion of the system whereas\nthe latter is sensitive to the fluctuations of the initial state. For our\ninvestigation we use a hybrid transport model based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach using an ideal\nhydrodynamic expansion for the hot and dense stage. Using UrQMD initial\nconditions for an Au-Au collision, particles resulting from a collision are\nmapped into an energy density distribution that is evolved event-by-event with\na hydrodynamic calculation. By averaging these distributions over different\nnumbers of events, we have studied how the granularity/smoothness of the\ndistribution affects the initial eccentricity, the initial triangularity, and\nthe resulting flow components. The average elliptic flow in non central\ncollisions is not sensitive to the granularity, while triangular flow is. The\ntriangularity might thus provide a good measure of the amount of initial state\nfluctuations that is necessary to reproduce the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 19:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

One of\nthe main themes in this work is that, after a careful study of the mathematics\nof the symmetry algebras one finds that in an integrable model, one can\ndirectly reconstruct S-matrices just from the algebra. It has been known for a\nlong time that S-matrices in integrable models are fixed by symmetry. However,\nLie algebra symmetry, the Yang-Baxter equation, crossing and unitarity, which\nare what constrains the S-matrix in integrable models, are often taken to be\nseparate, independent properties of the S-matrix. Here, we construct scattering\nmatrices purely from the Yangian, showing that the Yangian is the right\nalgebraic object to unify all required symmetries of many integrable models. In\nparticular, we reconstruct the S-matrix of the principal chiral field, and, up\nto a CDD factor, of other integrable field theories with su(n) symmetry.\nFurthermore, we study the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is also believed to be\nintegrable in the planar limit. We reconstruct the S-matrices at weak and at\nstrong coupling from the Yangian or its classical limit. We give a pedagogical\nintroduction into the subject, presenting a unified perspective of Yangians and\ntheir applications in physics.

The models are constructed by solving the\nnonlinear Poisson equation for the self-consistent mean-field potential. For\nrigidly rotating configurations, the solutions are obtained by an asymptotic\nexpansion on the rotation strength parameter. The differentially rotating\nmodels are constructed by means of an iterative approach based on a Legendre\nseries expansion of the density and the potential. The two classes of models\nexhibit complementary properties. The rigidly rotating configurations are\nflattened toward the equatorial plane, with deviations from spherical symmetry\nthat increase with the distance from the center. For models of the second\nfamily, the deviations from spherical symmetry are strongest in the central\nregion, whereas the outer parts tend to be quasi-spherical. The relevant\nparameter spaces are explored and the intrinsic and projected structural\nproperties are described. Special attention is given to the effect of different\noptions for the truncation of the distribution function in phase space. Models\nin the moderate rotation regime are best suited to applications to globular\nclusters. For general interest in stellar dynamics, at high values of the\nrotation strength the differentially rotating models exhibit a toroidal core\nembedded in a quasi-spherical configuration.

We show that\nStift et al. misinterpreted published magnetic Doppler imaging results and\nneglected some of the most fundamental principles behind magnetic mapping. We\ndemonstrate that the variation of atmospheric structure across the surface of a\nstar with chemical spots affects the local continuum intensity but is\nnegligible for the normalised local Stokes profiles.

The resulting distribution of chemical spots changes\ninsignificantly compared to the previous modelling based on a single model\natmosphere, while the magnetic field geometry does not change at all.

This model is used to determine the origin of\ndouble-peaked NL (dNL) AGN in merging galaxies and their connection to\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) pairs, motivated by recent observations of such\nobjects. We find that dNL AGN induced by the relative motion of SMBH pairs are\na generic but short-lived feature of gaseous major mergers. dNL AGN should\noften be observed in late-stage mergers, during the kpc-scale phase of SMBH\ninspiral or soon after the SMBH merger. However, even within the kpc-scale\nphase, only a minority of dNL AGN are directly induced by SMBH motion; their\nlifetimes are typically a few Myr. Most double peaks arise from gas kinematics\nnear the SMBH, although prior to the SMBH merger up to 80% of all dNL profiles\nmay be influenced by SMBH motion via altered peak ratios or velocity offsets.\nThe total lifetimes of dNL AGN depend strongly on viewing angle and on\nproperties of the merging galaxies. Also, in a typical merger, at least 10-40%\nof the double peaks induced by SMBH motion have small projected separations,\n0.1-1 kpc, such that dual peaks of stellar surface brightness are not easily\nresolved. Diffuse tidal features can indicate late-stage galaxy mergers,\nalthough they do not distinguish SMBH pairs from merged SMBHs.

Our sample of 150 objects covers a wide range in\nmass, from giant ellipticals to the bright end of the dwarf-galaxy regime. We\nfocus on the colours FUV-i, NUV-i, FUV-NUV, u*-g and g-i. We find that all of\nthese colours are correlated with both luminosity and velocity dispersion at\nthe >5 sigma level, with FUV-i and FUV-NUV becoming bluer with increasing\n`mass' while the other colours become redder. We perform an empirical analysis\nto assess what fraction of the variation in each colour can be accounted for by\nvariations in the average stellar populations, as traced by the optical\nspectra. For u*-g and g-i, most of the observed scatter (~80% after allowing\nfor measurement errors and for systematic errors in u*-g) is attributable to\nstellar population variations, with colours becoming redder with increasing age\nand metallicity (Mg/H). The FUV-i colour becomes bluer with increasing age and\nwith increasing Mg/H, favouring a `metal-rich single-star' origin for the UV\nupturn. However, correlations with the optically-dominant stellar populations\naccount for only about half of the large observed scatter. We propose that the\nexcess scatter in FUV-i may be due to a varying proportion of ancient stars in\ngalaxies with younger average ages. The NUV-i colour is sensitive to age and\nMg/H, but exhibits excess scatter that can be attributed to `leakage' of the\nFUV upturn. Applying a correction based on the FUV-i colour we account for ~80%\nof the variance in NUV-i, as for the optical colours. The FUV-NUV colour shows\nstrong correlations with age and Mg/H, and little residual scatter.\nInterpreting this colour is complicated however, since it mixes the effects\nfrom the main-sequence turn-off with those from the hot evolved stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We aim to put constraints on the turbulent velocities and\nturbulent pressure in the ICM of the giant elliptical galaxies NGC 5044 and NGC\n5813 using XMM-Newton RGS observations. The magnitude of the turbulence is\nestimated using the Fe XVII lines at 15.01 A, 17.05 A, and 17.10 A in the RGS\nspectra. At low turbulent velocities, the gas becomes optically thick in the\n15.01 A line due to resonant scattering, while the 17 A lines remain optically\nthin. By comparing the (I(17.05)+I(17.10))/I(15.01) line ratio from RGS with\nsimulated line ratios for different Mach numbers, the level of turbulence is\nconstrained. The measurement is limited by systematic uncertainties in the\natomic data, which are at the 20-30% level. We find that the line ratio in NGC\n5813 is significantly higher than in NGC 5044. This difference can be explained\nby a higher level of turbulence in NGC 5044. The high turbulent velocities and\nthe fraction of the turbulent pressure support of >40% in NGC 5044, assuming\nisotropic turbulence, confirm that it is a highly disturbed system, probably\ndue to an off-axis merger. The turbulent pressure support in NGC 5813 is more\nmodest at 15-45%. The (I(17.05)+I(17.10))/I(15.01) line ratio in an optically\nthin plasma, calculated using AtomDB v2.0.1, is 2 sigma above the ratio\nmeasured in NGC 5044, which cannot be explained by resonant scattering.

Using this sample we show that at fixed\nvelocity dispersion there is no dependence of the clustering amplitude on\nstellar or dynamical mass. Conversely when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed\nthere is a clear dependence of the clustering amplitude on velocity dispersion\nwith higher dispersion galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude. We also\nshow that whilst when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed there remains a\ndependence of clustering amplitude on morphology, there is no such dependency\nwhen dispersion is fixed.

The purpose of\nthis paper is to bridge the gap between detailed models of inhomogeneous\nstellar winds in single stars and the phenomenological description of donor\nwinds in supergiant high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). We use results from\ntime-dependent hydrodynamical models of the instability in the line-driven wind\nof a massive supergiant star to derive the time-dependent accretion rate onto a\ncompact object in the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton approximation. The strong density\nand velocity fluctuations in the wind result in strong variability of the\nsynthetic X-ray light curves. The model predicts a large scale X-ray\nvariability, up to eight orders of magnitude, on relatively short timescales.\nThe apparent lack of evidence for such strong variability in the observed HMXBs\nindicates that the details of accretion process act to reduce the variability\ndue to the stellar wind velocity and density jumps. We, also, study the\nabsorption of X-rays in the clumped stellar wind by means of a 2-D stochastic\nwind model and find that absorption of X-rays changes strongly at different\norbital phases. Furthermore, we address the photoionization in the clumped\nwind, and show that the degree of ionization is affected by the wind clumping.\nA correction factor for the photoionization parameter is derived. It is shown\nthat the photoionization parameter is reduced by a factor Xi compared to the\nsmooth wind models with the same mass-loss rate, where Xi is the wind\ninhomogeneity parameter. We conclude that wind clumping must also be taken into\naccount when comparing the observed and model spectra of the photoionized\nstellar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2012 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The method is an\nextension of the snowball sample method and can, given that some assumptions\nare met, generate unbiased population estimates. One key assumption, not likely\nto be met, is that the acquaintance network in which the recruitment process\ntakes place is undirected, meaning that all recruiters should have the\npotential to be recruited by the person they recruit. Here we investigate the\npotential bias of directedness by simulating RDS on real and artificial network\nstructures. We show that directedness is likely to generate bias that cannot be\ncompensated for unless the sampled individuals know how many that potentially\nmay have recruited them (i.e. their indegree), which is unlikely in most\nsituations. Based on one known parameter, we propose an estimator for RDS on\ndirected networks when only outdegrees are observed.\n  By comparison of current RDS estimators' performances on networks with\nvarying structures, we find that our new estimator, together with a recent\nestimator, which requires the population size as a known quantity, have\nrelatively low level of estimate error and bias. Based on our new estimator,\nsensitivity analysis can be made by varying values of the known parameter to\ntake uncertainty of network directedness and error in reporting degrees into\naccount.

For eight\nof them, the highest resolution corresponds to $\\sim 130$ million particles\nwithin the virial radius, while for one this number is over one billion. We\nstudy the structure and substructure of these systems and contrast them with\nsix galaxy-sized dark matter haloes from the Aquarius Project, simulated at\ncomparable resolution. This comparison highlights the approximate mass\ninvariance of CDM halo structure and substructure. We find little difference in\nthe spherically-averaged mass, pseudo-phase-space density, and velocity\nanisotropy profiles of Aquarius and Phoenix haloes. When scaled to the virial\nproperties of the host halo, the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes\nare also very similar, despite the fact that Aquarius and Phoenix haloes differ\nby roughly three decades in virial mass. The most notable difference is that\ncluster haloes have been assembled more recently and are thus significantly\nless relaxed than galaxy haloes, which leads to decreased regularity, increased\nhalo-to-halo scatter and sizable deviations from the mean trends. This\naccentuates the effects of the strong asphericity of individual clusters on\nsurface density profiles, which may vary by up to a factor of three at a given\nradius, depending on projection. The high apparent concentration reported for\nsome strong-lensing clusters might very well reflect these effects.

For a\ncritical threshold f_c, the system experiences a transition akin to\npercolation. We determine the point of this transition and its characteristic\ncritical exponents applying a finite-size scaling analysis that takes\nexplicitly into account the directed nature of the q-model. By means of\nextensive numerical simulations, we show that this percolation transition is\nstrongly affected by the anisotropic nature of the model, yielding\ncharacteristic exponents which are neither those found in isotropic granular\nsystems nor those in the directed version of standard percolation. The\ndifferences shown by the computed exponents can be related to the presence of\nstrong directed correlations and mass conservation laws in the model under\nscrutiny.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 09:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

DDoS attacks are treated as a congestion-control problem, but\nbecause most such congestion is caused by malicious hosts not obeying\ntraditional end-to-end congestion control, the problem must be handled by the\nrouters. Functionality is added to each router to detect and preferentially\ndrop packets that probably belong to an attack. Upstream routers are also\nnotified to drop such packets in order that the router's resources be used to\nroute legitimate traffic hence term pushback. Client puzzles have been\nadvocated as a promising countermeasure to DoS attacks in the recent years. In\norder to identify the attackers, the victim server issues a puzzle to the\nclient that sent the traffic. When the client is able to solve the puzzle, it\nis assumed to be authentic and the traffic from it is allowed into the server.\nIf the victim suspects that the puzzles are solved by most of the clients, it\nincreases the complexity of the puzzles. This puzzle solving technique allows\nthe traversal of the attack traffic throughout the intermediate routers before\nreaching the destination. In order to attain the advantages of both pushback\nand puzzle solving techniques, a hybrid scheme called Router based Pushback\ntechnique, which involves both the techniques to solve the problem of DDoS\nattacks is proposed. In this proposal, the puzzle solving mechanism is pushed\nback to the core routers rather than having at the victim. The router based\nclient puzzle mechanism checks the host system whether it is legitimate or not\nby providing a puzzle to be solved by the suspected host.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 10:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-11"}

The system undergoes a\ndimerization transition at a critical bond alternation parameter\n$\\delta=\\delta_{\\rm c}$, where $\\delta_{\\rm c} = 0$ for the S=1/2 chain. The\nSU(2)-symmetric sine-Gordon theory is known to be an effective field theory of\nthe system except at the transition point. The sine-Gordon theory has a\nSU(2)-triplet and a SU(2)-singlet of elementary excitation, and the mass ratio\n$r$ of the singlet to the triplet is $\\sqrt{3}$. However, our numerical\ncalculation with the infinite time-evolving block decimation method shows that\n$r$ depends on the frustration (next-nearest-neighbor coupling) and is\ngenerally different from $\\sqrt{3}$. This can be understood as an effect of\nmarginal perturbation to the sine-Gordon theory. In fact, at the critical\nfrustration separating the second-order and first-order dimerization\ntransitions, the marginal operator vanishes and $r=\\sqrt{3}$ holds. We derive\nthe mass ratio $r$ analytically using form-factor perturbation theory combined\nwith a renormalization-group analysis.

Due to the low\nthrust propulsion, Dawn will slowly cross and transit through ground-track\nresonances, where the perturbations on Dawn orbit may be significant. In this\ncontext, to safety go the Dawn mission from the approach orbit to the lowest\nscience orbit, it is essential to know the properties of the crossed\nresonances. This paper analytically investigates the properties of the major\nground-track resonances (1:1, 1:2, 2:3 and 3:2) appearing for Vesta orbiters:\nlocation of the equilibria, aperture of the resonances and period at the stable\nequilibria. We develop a general method using an averaged Hamiltonian\nformulation with a spherical harmonic approximation of the gravity field.

We conclude that the inherent heterogeneities in transmissibilities\narising from correlations in the degrees of overlap between neighbouring\nplants, render a population of root systems less susceptible to epidemic\ninvasion than a corresponding homogeneous system.

The efficiency of\ncreating new knowledge is considered to have a geographical component, i.e.\nsome regions are more capable in scientific knowledge production than others.\nThis article shows a method to use a network representation of scientific\ninteraction to assess the relative efficiency of regions with diverse\nboundaries in channeling knowledge through a science system. In a first step, a\nweighted aggregate of the betweenness centrality is produced from empirical\ndata (aggregation). The subsequent randomization of this empirical network\nproduces the necessary Null-model for significance testing and normalization\n(randomization). This step is repeated to yield higher confidence about the\nresults (re-sampling). The results are robust estimates for the relative\nregional efficiency to broker knowledge, which is discussed along with\ncross-sectional and longitudinal empirical examples. The network representation\nacts as a straight-forward metaphor of conceptual ideas from economic geography\nand neighboring disciplines. However, the procedure is not limited to\ncentrality measures, nor is it limited to spatial aggregates. Therefore, it\noffers a wide range of application for scientometrics and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 13:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-11"}

We aim to review the properties of these\nrotational velocity distributions in some detail as a function of stellar mass\nand age. We have gathered v sin i for a sample of 2014 B6- to F2-type stars. We\nhave determined the masses and ages for these objects with stellar evolution\nmodels. The (Teff, log L/Lsun)-parameters were determined from the uvby-\\beta\nphotometry and the HIPPARCOS parallaxes. The velocity distributions show two\nregimes that depend on the stellar mass. Stars less massive than 2.5 Msun have\na unimodal equatorial velocity distribution and show a monotonical acceleration\nwith age on the main sequence (MS). Stars more massive have a bimodal\nequatorial velocity distribution. Contrarily to theoretical predictions, the\nequatorial velocities of stars from about 1.7 Msun to 3.2 Msun undergo a strong\nacceleration in the first third of the MS evolutionary phase, while in the last\nthird of the MS they evolve roughly as if there were no angular momentum\nredistribution in the external stellar layers. The studied stars might start in\nthe ZAMS not necessarily as rigid rotators, but with a total angular momentum\nlower than the critical one of rigid rotators. The stars seem to evolve as\ndifferential rotators all the way of their MS life span and the variation of\nthe observed rotational velocities proceeds with characteristic time scales\n\\delta(t)\\sim 0.2 t_MS, where t_MS is the time spent by a star in the MS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 13:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We\nwish to argue that the evolution of life marks the end of a physics world view\nof law entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon discussing the\nvariability of the very \"contexts of life\": the interactions between organisms,\nbiological niches and ecosystems. These are ever changing, intrinsically\nindeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the \"niches\"\nwhich constitute the boundary conditions on selection. More generally, by the\nmathematical unprestatability of the \"phase space\" (space of possibilities), no\nlaws of motion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence,\nfrom life to life. The purpose of this paper is the integration of variation\nand diversity in a sound conceptual frame and situate unpredictability at a\nnovel theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our argument will be\ncarried on in close comparisons with physics and the mathematical constructions\nof phase spaces in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as\ninvariant preserving transformations will allow us to understand the nature of\nphysical phase spaces and to stress the differences required for a sound\nbiological theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of\n\"enablement\". This will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a\ndifference that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differences\nwill allow us to stress that \"non conservation principles\" are at the core of\nevolution, in contrast to physical dynamics, largely based on conservation\nprinciples as symmetries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry\nchanges in physics, will be discussed, and lead to \"extended criticality\" as a\nconceptual frame for a better understanding of the living state of matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 15:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-01-11"}

We present regime diagrams to quantify\nthe state of the flow as a function of the initial liquid concentration, the\nporous-medium Rayleigh number, and the sample width. For a given liquid\nconcentration, increasing both the porous-medium Rayleigh number and the sample\nwidth caused the system to change from a stable state of no flow to a different\nstate with the formation of chimneys.

Comparing radio properties of the maser galaxies with a\nsample of Seyferts without detected H2O maser, we find that (1) the spectral\nindices agree within the error limits, and (2) maser host galaxies have higher\nnuclear radio continuum luminosities, exceeding those of the comparison sample\nby factors of order 5.

Since TTVs\nare strongly enhanced in systems close to mean-motion resonances (MMR), even a\nlow mass planet can produce an observable signal. This technique has thus been\nproposed to detect terrestrial planets. In this letter, we analyse TTV signals\nfor systems in or close to MMR in order to illustrate the difficulties arising\nin the determination of planetary parameters. TTVs are computed numerically\nwith an n-body integrator for a variety of systems close to MMR. The main\nfeatures of these TTVs are also derived analytically. Systems deeply inside MMR\ndo not produce particularly strong TTVs, while those close to MMR generate\nquasiperiodic TTVs characterised by a dominant long period term and a low\namplitude remainder. If the remainder is too weak to be detected, then the\nsignal is strongly degenerate and this prevents the determination of the\nplanetary parameters. Even though an Earth mass planet can be detected by the\nTTV method if it is close to a MMR, it may not be possible to assert that this\nplanet is actually an Earth mass planet. On the other hand, if the system is\nright in the center of a MMR, the high amplitude oscillation of the TTV signal\nvanishes and the detection of the perturber becomes as difficult as it is far\nfrom MMR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 15:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

A less studied property of\nsuch systems is that they can exhibit a variety of temporal behaviours due to\nthe operation of different feedback mechanisms. We investigate the effects of\none possible feedback loop, where \\gamma-rays produced by photopion processes\nare being quenched whenever their compactness increases above a critical level.\nThis causes a spontaneous creation of soft photons in the system that result in\nfurther proton cooling and more production of \\gamma-rays, thus making the loop\noperate. We perform an analytical study of a simplified set of equations\ndescribing the system, in order to investigate the connection of its temporal\nbehaviour with key physical parameters. We also perform numerical integration\nof the full set of kinetic equations verifying not only our analytical results\nbut also those of previous numerical studies. We find that once the system\nbecomes `supercritical', it can exhibit either a periodic behaviour or a damped\noscillatory one leading to a steady state.

Secondly, Mutual\nInformation is employed to construct the FWSVM by weighting different features\nbased on their degree of importance. Finally, since parameter selection plays a\nvital role in classification accuracy of SVMs, MCS is applied to select the\nbest parameter values. The proposed MI-MCS-FWSVM method obtains 93.58% accuracy\non UCI dataset.
