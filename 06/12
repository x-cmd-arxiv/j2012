First, we consider the question of\nhow well maximum matching can be approximated in a single pass over the input\nusing $\\tilde O(n)$ space, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input\ngraph. Two natural variants of this problem have been considered in the\nliterature: (1) the edge arrival setting, where edges arrive in the stream and\n(2) the vertex arrival setting, where vertices on one side of the graph arrive\nin the stream together with all their incident edges. The latter setting has\nalso been studied extensively in the context of online algorithms, where each\narriving vertex has to either be matched irrevocably or discarded upon arrival.\nIn the online setting, the celebrated algorithm of Karp-Vazirani-Vazirani\nachieves a $1-1/e$ approximation. Despite the fact that the streaming model is\nless restrictive in that the algorithm is not constrained to match vertices\nirrevocably upon arrival, the best known approximation in the streaming model\nwith vertex arrivals and $\\tilde O(n)$ space is the same factor of $1-1/e$.\n  We show that no single pass streaming algorithm that uses $\\tilde O(n)$ space\ncan achieve a better than $1-1/e$ approximation to maximum matching, even in\nthe vertex arrival setting. This leads to the striking conclusion that no\nsingle pass streaming algorithm can do better than online algorithms unless it\nuses significantly more than $\\tilde O(n)$ space. Additionally, our bound\nyields the best known impossibility result for approximating matchings in the\nedge arrival model.\n  We also give a simple algorithm that achieves approximation ratio\n$1-e^{-k}k^{k-1}/(k-1)!=1-\\frac1{\\sqrt{2\\pi k}}+o(1/k)$ in $k$ passes in the\nvertex arrival model using linear space, improving upon previously best known\nconvergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 16:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 11:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 16:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

Some open issues\nregarding the 2D structure of the main properties of the ionized gas remain to\nbe addressed.

The maps for n_e as traced by several line ratios are\ncompatible with a 3D stratified view of the nebula with the highest n_e in the\ninnermost layers and a decrease of n_e outwards.

The joint interpretation of our two T_e maps is consistent with a\nT_e structure in 3D with higher temperatures close to the main ionizing source\nsurrounded by a colder and more diffuse component.

However, to\ndescribe the phase diagram, two additional dimensionless parameters, the\nminimum and maximum particle radii are also required. We find that the\ntransition between any two adjacent regions of the phase diagram solely depends\non the largest and smallest particle sizes, but not on the shape of the\ndistribution function of the radii. We consider size dispersions up-to 20% of\nthe average radius using a physically motivated truncated Gaussian-size\ndistribution, and focus on the regime where adsorbing particles do not interact\nwith those previously adsorbed on neighboring cells to characterize the jammed\nstate structure. The study generalizes previous exact relations on monodisperse\nparticles to account for size dispersion. Due to the presence of the pattern,\nthe coverage shows a non-monotonic dependence on the cell size. The pattern\nalso affects the radius of adsorbed particles, where one observes preferential\nadsorption of smaller radii particularly at high polydispersity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 16:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

Most calculations of eta_{crit} assume that\nthe noise is random and can be modeled as white noise. However, most sources\nsuffer from colored noise. Indeed, since entangled states are usually created\nas a superposition of two possible deexcitation paths, a partial\ndistinguishability between the two processes leads to the appearance of colored\nnoise in the generated state. Recently, there was a proposal for a\nloophole-free Bell test [A. Cabello and F. Sciarrino, Phys. Rev.

Here we obtain eta_{crit}, the optimal quantum\nstates, and the local settings for a loophole-free Bell test as a function of\nthe amount of colored noise. We consider three bipartite Bell inequalities with\nn dichotomic settings: Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (n=2), I_{3322} (n=3), and\nA_5 (n=4), both for the case of symmetric efficiencies, corresponding to\nphoton-photon Bell tests, and for the totally asymmetric case, corresponding to\natom-photon Bell tests. Remarkably, in all these cases, eta_{crit} is robust\nagainst the colored noise. The present analysis can find application in any\ntest of Bell inequalities in which the dominant noise is of the colored type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 17:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 21:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-21"}

Stellar mass objects can\nefficiently agglomerate when facilitated by the gas disk. Stars, compact\nobjects and binaries can migrate, accrete and merge within disks around\nsupermassive black holes. While dynamical heating by cusp stars excites the\nvelocity dispersion of nuclear cluster objects (NCOs) in the disk, gas in the\ndisk damps NCO orbits. If gas damping dominates, NCOs remain in the disk with\ncircularized orbits and large collision cross-sections. IMBH seeds can grow\nextremely rapidly by collisions with disk NCOs at low relative velocities,\nallowing for super-Eddington growth rates. Once an IMBH seed has cleared out\nits feeding zone of disk NCOs, growth of IMBH seeds can become dominated by gas\naccretion from the AGN disk. However, the IMBH can migrate in the disk and\nexpand its feeding zone, permitting a super-Eddington accretion rate to\ncontinue. Growth of IMBH seeds via NCO collisions is enhanced by a pile-up of\nmigrators.\n  We highlight the remarkable parallel between the growth of IMBH in AGN disks\nwith models of giant planet growth in protoplanetary disks. If an IMBH becomes\nmassive enough it can open a gap in the AGN disk. IMBH migration in AGN disks\nmay stall, allowing them to survive the end of the AGN phase and remain in\ngalactic nuclei. Our proposed mechanisms should be more efficient at growing\nIMBH in AGN disks than the standard model of IMBH growth in stellar clusters.\nDynamical heating of disk NCOs by cusp stars is transferred to the gas in a AGN\ndisk helping to maintain the outer disk against gravitational instability.\nModel predictions, observational constraints and implications are discussed in\na companion paper (Paper II).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 18:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We show that, for Stokes' flow in a\nlid-driven cavity, these various braids give good lower bounds on the\ntopological entropy over the respective parameter regimes in which they exist.\nWe make the case that a topological analysis based on spatiotemporal braiding\nof almost-cyclic sets can be used for analyzing chaos in fluid flows. Hence we\nfurther develop a connection between set-oriented statistical methods and\ntopological methods, which promises to be an important analysis tool in the\nstudy of complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 19:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 04:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-07"}

In a sufficiently large out-of-plane field, a propagating\noscillation mode appears in such a system. Due to the absence of the\ngeometrically caused wave decay in 1D systems, this mode is expected to enable\na long-distance synchronization between STNOs. Indeed, our simulations predict\nthat synchronization of two STNOs on a nanowire is possible up to the\nintercontact distance 3 mkm (for the nanowire width 50 nm). However, we have\nalso found several qualitatively new features of the synchronization behaviour\nfor this system, which make the achievement of a stable synchronization in this\ngeometry to a highly non-trivial task. In particular, there exist a minimal\ndistance between the nanocontacts, below which a synchronization of STNOs can\nnot be achieved. Further, when the current value in the first contact is kept\nconstant, the amplitude of synchronized oscillations depends non-monotonously\non the current value in the second contact.

Its large\nwavelength coverage makes the X-shooter spectrograph an excellent tool to study\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, in particular if the\nredshift is not known beforehand. Here we determine the properties of a GRB\nhost at z = 4.66723 from a number of resonant low- and high ionization and\nfine-structure absorption lines. This is one of the highest redshifts where a\ndetailed analysis with medium-resolution data has been possible. We detect one\nintervening system at z = 2.18. The velocity components of the absorption lines\nare fitted with Voigt-profiles and we determine a metallicity of [M/H] = -1.0\n\\pm 0.1 using S.

Si II* together with the restframe\nUV energy release determined from GROND data gives us the distance of 0.3 to 1\nkpc of the absorbing material from the GRB. We measure a low extinction of AV =\n0.24 \\pm 0.06 mag using X-ray spectral information and the flux calibrated\nX-shooter spectrum. GRB-DLAs have a shallower evolution of metallicity with\nredshift than QSO absorbers and no evolution in HI column density or ionization\nfraction. GRB hosts at high redshift might continue the trend towards lower\nmetallicities in the LZ-relation with redshift, but the sample is still too\nsmall to draw a definite conclusion. While the detection of GRBs at z > 4 with\ncurrent satellites is still difficult, they are very important for our\nunderstanding of the early epochs of star- and galaxy-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 19:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Being free of selection effects (except flux limit), this\nsample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical properties\nof GRB prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. The afterglow X-ray\nluminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11\nhr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropic\nenergy E_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity L_iso and the rest frame peak\nenergy E_peak. We find that the rest frame afterglow X-ray luminosity do\ncorrelate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of each\ncorrelation decreases over time. This result is in agreement with the idea that\nthe GRB X-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination of\ndifferent components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,\nwith the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,\nrespectively. In particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallow\ndecay phase often observed in GRB X-ray light curves are powered by activity\nfrom the central engine. The existence of the L_X-E_iso correlation at late\ntimes (t_rf > 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among different\nbursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the prompt\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 20:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We calculate evaporation rates by solving the\nhydrodynamical problem for planetary evaporation including heating from both\nX-ray and EUV radiation. We show that most close-in planets (a<0.1 AU) are\nevaporating hydrodynamically, with the evaporation occurring in two distinct\nregimes: X-ray driven, in which the X-ray heated flow contains a sonic point,\nand EUV driven, in which the X-ray region is entirely sub-sonic. The mass-loss\nrates scale as L_X/a^2 for X-ray driven evaporation, and as Phi_*^{1/2}/a for\nEUV driven evaporation at early times, with mass-loss rates of order\n10e10-10e14 g/s. No exact scaling exists for the mass-loss rate with planet\nmass and planet radius, however, in general evaporation proceeds more rapidly\nfor planets with lower densities and higher masses. Furthermore, we find that\nin general the transition from X-ray driven to EUV driven evaporation occurs at\nlower X-ray luminosities for planets closer to their parent stars and for\nplanets with lower densities.\n  Coupling our evaporation models to the evolution of the high energy radiation\n- which falls with time - we are able to follow the evolution of evaporating\nplanets. We find that most planets start off evaporating in the X-ray driven\nregime, but switch to EUV driven once the X-ray luminosity falls below a\ncritical value. The evolution models suggest that while `hot Jupiters' are\nevaporating, they are not evaporating at a rate sufficient to remove the entire\ngaseous envelope on Gyr time-scales. However, we do find that close in Neptune\nmass planets are more susceptible to complete evaporation of their envelopes.\nThus we conclude that planetary evaporation is more important for lower mass\nplanets, particularly those in the `hot Neptune'/`super Earth' regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 20:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper, we\npresent a global scenario based on calculations coupling episodic accretion\nhistories derived from numerical simulations of collapsing cloud prestellar\ncores of various masses and subsequent protostar evolution. Our calculations\nshow that, assuming an initial protostar mass $\\mi \\sim 1\\,\\mjup$, typical of\nthe second Larson's core, both the luminosity spread in the HRD and the\ninferred properties of Fu Ori events (mass, radius, accretion rate) can be\nexplained by this scenario, providing two conditions. First, there must be some\nvariation within the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the protostar\nduring the accretion process. Second the range of this variation should\nincrease with increasing accretion burst intensity, and thus with the initial\ncore mass and final star mass. The numerical hydrodynamics simulations of\ncollapsing cloud prestellar cores indeed show that the intensity of the\naccretion bursts correlates with the mass and initial angular momentum of the\nprestellar core. Massive prestellar cores with high initial angular momentum\nare found to produce intense bursts characteristic of Fu Ori like events.

The dominant sharp spectral feature in their spectra is\nthe 6.4 keV fluorescent line of iron, which may contribute to as much as ~ 5-10\n% of the CXB spectral intensity at ~ 2-6 keV. Owing to cosmological redshift,\nthe line photons detected at the energy E carry information about objects\nlocated at the redshift z=6.4/E-1. In particular, imprinted in their angular\nfluctuations is the information about the large-scale structure at redshift z.\nThis opens the possibility of performing the Fe K_alpha line tomography of the\ncosmic large-scale structure. We show that detection of the tomographic signal\nat ~100 sigma confidence requires an all-sky survey by an instrument with an\neffective area of ~10 m^2 and field of view of ~1 deg^2. The signal is\nstrongest for objects located at the redshift z~1 and at the angular scales\ncorresponding to l ~ 100-300, therefore an optimal detection can be achieved\nwith an instrument having a rather modest angular resolution of ~ 0.1-0.5 deg.\nFor such an instrument, the CCD-type energy resolution of ~ 100-200 eV FWHM is\nentirely sufficient for the optimal separation of the signals coming from\ndifferent redshifts. The gain in the signal strength that could potentially be\nachieved with energy resolution comparable to the line width is nullified by\nthe photon counting and AGN discreteness noise. Among the currently planned and\nproposed missions, these requirements are best satisfied by LOFT, even though\nit was proposed for an entirely different purpose. Among others, clear\ndetection should be achieved by WFXT (~ 20-35 sigma) and ATHENA (~ 10-20\nsigma). eROSITA, in the course of its 4 years all-sky survey, will detect the\ntomographic signal only marginally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 20:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 10:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Using linear cosmological perturbation theory we track each Fourier\nmode of the curvature fluctuation throughout the entire cosmic evolution. Using\nstandard matching conditions for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies we verify\nthat the spectral index does not change during the bounce.

They are involved in core\ncellular processes and their dysregulation is associated to a broad range of\nhuman diseases. This paper focus on a minimal microRNA-mediated regulatory\ncircuit, in which a protein-coding gene (host gene) is targeted by a microRNA\nlocated inside one of its introns. Results: Autoregulation via intronic\nmicroRNAs is widespread in the human regulatory network, as confirmed by our\nbioinformatic analysis, and can perform several regulatory tasks despite its\nsimple topology. Our analysis, based on analytical calculations and\nsimulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene\nexpression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and Weber's\nlaw, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network\nto the host gene. A fine-tuning of the circuit parameters can optimize each of\nthese functions.

Incorporating CM-SA is to prevent a type of ping-pong jumps\nfrom happening when two objects standing face-to-face want to move in opposite\ndirections.

However, much less is known about the content and physical status of\nthe hot X-ray gas in low-mass ellipticals. In the present paper we study the\nX-ray gas content of four low-mass elliptical galaxies using archival Chandra\nX-ray observations. The sample galaxies, NGC821, NGC3379, NGC4278, and NGC4697,\nhave approximately identical K-band luminosities, and hence stellar masses, yet\ntheir X-ray appearance is strikingly different. We conclude that the unresolved\nemission in NGC821 and NGC3379 is built up from a multitude of faint compact\nobjects, such as coronally active binaries and cataclysmic variables. Despite\nthe non-detection of X-ray gas, these galaxies may host low density, and hence\nlow luminosity, X-ray gas components, which undergo a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)\ndriven outflow. We detect hot X-ray gas with a temperature of kT ~ 0.35 keV in\nNGC4278, the component of which has a steeper surface brightness distribution\nthan the stellar light. Within the central 50 arcsec (~3.9 kpc) the estimated\ngas mass is ~3 x 10^7 M_sun, implying a gas mass fraction of ~0.06%. We\ndemonstrate that the X-ray gas exhibits a bipolar morphology in the\nnortheast-southwest direction, indicating that it may be outflowing from the\ngalaxy. The mass and energy budget of the outflow can be maintained by evolved\nstars and SNe Ia, respectively. The X-ray gas in NGC4697 has an average\ntemperature of kT ~ 0.3 keV, and a significantly broader distribution than the\nstellar light. The total gas mass within 90 arcsec (~5.1 kpc) is ~2.1 x 10^8\nM_sun, hence the gas mass fraction is ~0.4%. Based on the distribution and\nphysical parameters of the X-ray gas, we conclude that it is most likely in\nhydrostatic equilibrium, although a subsonic outflow may be present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 04:03:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 22:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This dynamical model can\nbe considered to describe the motion in the central parts of a galaxy, for\nvalues of energies larger than the energy of escape. We use the classical\nmethod of the surface of section, in order to visualize and interpret the\nstructure of the phase space of the dynamical system. Moreover, the Lyapunov\nCharacteristic Exponent (LCE), is used in order to make an estimation of the\ndegree of the chaoticity of the orbits in our galactic model. Our numerical\ncalculations suggest that in this galactic type potential, there are two kinds\nof orbits: (i) escaping orbits and (ii) trapped orbits which do not escape at\nall. Furthermore, a large number of orbits of the dynamical system, display\nchaotic motion. Among the chaotic orbits, there are orbits that escape fast and\nalso orbits that remain trapped for vast time intervals. When the value of the\ntest particle's energy exceeds slightly the energy of escape, the amount of the\ntrapped regular orbits increases, as the the value of the angular momentum\nincreases. Therefore, the extent of the chaotic regions observed in the phase\nplane decreases as the value of the energy increases. Moreover, we calculate\nthe average value of the escape period of the chaotic orbits and we try to\ncorrelate it with the value of the energy and also with the maximum value of\nthe z component of the orbits. In addition, we find that the value of the LCE\ncorresponding to each chaotic region, for different values of the energy,\nincreases exponentially as the value of the energy increases.

The 'neuron'\nconstitutes of a lateral spin valve (LSV) with multiple input magnets,\nconnected to an output magnet, using metal channels. The low resistance,\nmagneto-metallic neurons operate at a small terminal voltage of ~20mV, while\nperforming analog computation upon photo sensor inputs. The static current-flow\nacross the device terminals is limited to small periods, corresponding to\nmagnet switching time, and, is determined by a low duty-cycle system-clock.\nThus, the energy-cost of analog-mode processing, inevitable in most image\nsensing applications, is reduced and made comparable to that of dynamic and\nleakage power consumption in peripheral CMOS units. Performance of the proposed\narchitecture for some common image sensing and processing applications like,\nfeature extraction, halftone compression and digitization, have been obtained\nthrough physics based device simulation framework, coupled with SPICE. Results\nindicate that the proposed design scheme can achieve more than two orders of\nmagnitude reduction in computation energy, as compared to the state of art CMOS\ndesigns, that are based on conventional mixed-signal image acquisition and\nprocessing schemes.

The LVD and OPERA experiments are both\ninstalled in the same laboratory: LNGS. The relative position of the two\ndetectors, separated by an average distance of ~ 160 m, allows the use of very\nhigh energy horizontal muons to cross-calibrate the timing systems of the two\ndetectors, using a TOF technique which is totally independent from TOF of CNGS\nneutrino events. Indeed, the OPERA-LVD direction lies along the so-called\n\"Teramo anomaly\", a region in the Gran Sasso massif where LVD has established,\nmany years ago, the existence of an anomaly in the mountain structure, which\nexhibits a low m. w. e. thickness for horizontal directions. The \"abundant\"\nhigh-energy horizontal muons (nearly 100 per year) going through LVD and OPERA\nexist because of this anomaly in the mountain orography. The total live time of\nthe data in coincidence correspond to 1200 days from mid 2007 until March 2012.\nThe time coincidence study of LVD and OPERA detectors is based on 306 cosmic\nhorizontal muon events and shows the existence of a negative time shift in the\nOPERA set-up of the order of deltaT(AB) = - (73 \\pm 9) ns when two calendar\nperiods, A and B, are compared. This result shows a systematic effect in the\nOPERA timing system from August 2008 until December 2011. The size of the\neffect is comparable with the neutrino velocity excess recently measured by\nOPERA. It is probably interesting not to forget that with the MRPC technology\ndeveloped by the ALICE Bologna group the TOF world record accuracy of 20 ps was\nreached. That technology can be implemented at LNGS for a high precision\ndetermination of TOF with the CNGS neutrino beams of an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the value of the OPERA systematic effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 11:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-13"}

These systems\npresent an interest both in astrophysics and fundamental physics. In order to\nmake a high precision determination of their physical parameters, we need very\naccurate theoretical waveform models or templates. In the case of a circular\nequatorial orbit, the key stumbling block to the creation of these templates is\nthe flux function of the GW. This function can be modeled either via very\nexpensive numerical simulations, which then make the templates unusable for GW\nastronomy, or via some analytic approximation method such as a post-Newtonian\napproximation. This approximation is known to be asymptotically divergent and\nis only known up to 5.5PN order for the Schwarzschild case and to 4PN order for\nthe Kerr case. A way to improve the convergence of the flux is to use\nre-summation methods. In this work we extend previous results using the Pad\\'e\nand Chebyshev approximations, first by taking into account the absorption of\nthe GWs by the central black hole which was neglected in previous studies, and\nsecondly by using the information from the Schwarzschild and absorption terms\nto create a Kerr flux up to 5.5PN order.

Why do galaxies follow these\ncharacteristic trends? What can they tell us about the process of galaxy\nformation?

The emission is\nelongated in the NE-SW direction, misaligned with respect to the stellar body,\nand aligned with the ionized gas, and with the Spitzer IRAC 8\\mum non-stellar\nemission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor of \\sim 18 since\nthe first Chandra observation in 2005, a dimming that enabled the detection of\nhot gas even at the position of the nucleus. Both in the projected and\ndeprojected profiles, the gas shows a significantly larger temperature (kT=0.75\nkeV) in the inner \\sim 300 pc than in the surrounding region, where it stays at\n\\sim 0.3 keV, a value lower than expected from standard gas heating\nassumptions. The nuclear X-ray emission is consistent with that of a low\nradiative efficiency accretion flow, accreting mass at a rate close to the\nBondi one; estimates of the power of the nuclear jets require that the\naccretion rate is not largely reduced with respect to the Bondi rate. Among\npossibile origins for the central large hot gas temperature, such as\ngravitational heating from the central massive black hole and a recent AGN\noutburst, the interaction with the nuclear jets seems more likely, especially\nif the latter remain confined, and heat the nuclear region frequently. The\nunusual hot gas distribution on the galactic scale could be due to the\naccreting cold gas triggering the cooling of the hot phase, a process also\ncontributing to the observed line emission from ionize gas, and to the hot gas\ntemperature being lower than expected; alternatively, the latter could be due\nto an efficiency of the type Ia supernova energy mixing lower than usually\nadopted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 13:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Finally we computed some simple\nmodels of the ionised gas around CAL83 and compare the predicted to the\nobserved spectra. CAL83 appears to have a fairly standard ionisation nebula as\nfar as the morphology goes: the edges where H is recombining are strong in the\nlow stage ionisation lines and the central, clumpy regions are stronger in the\nhigher stage ionisation lines. But the He II emission is unusual in being\nconfined to one side of CAL83 rather than being homogeneously distributed as\nwith the other ions. We model the CAL83 nebula with cloudy using model\nparameters for SXSs found in the literature. The He II emission does not fit in\nwith model predictions; in fact none of the models is able to fit the observed\nspectrum very well. The spectral line images of the region surrounding CAL83\nare revealing and instructive. However, more modelling of the spectrum of the\nionised gas is necessary, and especially for the high-ionisation level emission\nfrom CAL83.

With the ever-increasing size of data sets in cosmology, there\nis increasing burden placed on adequate modeling; systematic errors in the\nmodel will dominate where previously these were swamped by statistical errors.\nFor example, Gaussian distributions are an insufficient representation for\nerrors in quantities like photometric redshifts. Likewise, it can be difficult\nto quantify analytically the distribution of errors that are introduced in\ncomplex fitting codes. Without a simple form for these distributions, it\nbecomes difficult to accurately construct a likelihood function for the data as\na function of parameters of interest. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)\nprovides a means of probing the posterior distribution when direct calculation\nof a sufficiently accurate likelihood is intractable. ABC allows one to bypass\ndirect calculation of the likelihood but instead relies upon the ability to\nsimulate the forward process that generated the data. These simulations can\nnaturally incorporate priors placed on nuisance parameters, and hence these can\nbe marginalized in a natural way. We present and discuss ABC methods in the\ncontext of supernova cosmology using data from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey.\nAssuming a flat cosmology and constant dark energy equation of state we\ndemonstrate that ABC can recover an accurate posterior distribution. Finally we\nshow that ABC can still produce an accurate posterior distribution when we\ncontaminate the sample with Type IIP supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 15:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 17:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The equation-of-motion includes some bath effects non-perturbatively,\nand can be used to simulate line- shapes beyond the Markovian approximation and\nopen electronic dynamics which are subjects of renewed recent interest. Energy\nconversion and transport depend critically on the ratio of electron-electron\ncoupling to bath-electron coupling, which is a fitted parameter if a\nphenomenological basis of many-electron states is used to develop an electronic\nequation of motion.

Ultra-violet (UV) emission from a quasar is normally\nfree from the contamination from its host galaxy. Polarization fraction of the\nquasar's disc emission can therefore be determined by comparing total UV\nemission with polarized visible to near-infrared (NIR) emission; and the\nresulting continuum spectrum from UV to infrared can reveal the theoretically\nexpected Balmer edge absorption feature. We fit the polarized spectra in\nvisible and NIR bands together with the total UV spectra of two type-1 quasars\n(3C 95, 4C 09.72), to an extended geometrically thin and optically thick\naccretion disc model. In addition to the standard model, we include the Balmer\nedge absorption due to co-rotational neutral gas on a narrow annulus of the\naccretion disc. We find that the extended thin accretion disc model provides\nadequate description on the continuum spectra of the two quasars from UV to NIR\nwavelengths. A Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain fitting to the continuum spectra is\nable to well constrain the true polarization fraction of the disk emission,\nwhich allows the Balmer edge feature to be completely revealed from polarized\nvisible to UV continua. The Balmer edge feature is prominent in both quasars'\nspectra, and is significantly broadened due to the orbital motion of gas in the\naccretion disc. The broadening of the Balmer edge feature is therefore related\nto the quasar's inclination. This work proves the concept of determining\nquasar's inclination from the Balmer edge feature in their continuum spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 15:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-12"}
