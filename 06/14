At such locations, the Lindblad torque is known\nto suffer strong deviation from its standard value, with potentially important\nimplications for type I migration, but the full treatment of the tidal\ninteraction is cumbersome and not well suited to models of planetary population\nsynthesis. The expression that we propose retains the simplicity of the\nstandard Lindblad torque formula and gives results that accurately reproduce\nthose of numerical simulations, even at locations where the disk temperature\nundergoes abrupt changes. Our study is conducted by means of customized\nnumerical simulations in the low-mass regime, in locally isothermal disks, and\ncompared to linear torque estimates obtained by summing fully analytic torque\nestimates at each Lindblad resonance. The functional dependence of our modified\nLindblad torque expression is suggested by an estimate of the shift of the\nLindblad resonances that mostly contribute to the torque, in a disk with sharp\ngradients of temperature or surface density, while the numerical coefficients\nof the new terms are adjusted to seek agreement with numerics. As side results,\nwe find that the vortensity related corotation torque undergoes a boost at an\nopacity transition that can counteract migration, and we find evidence from\nnumerical simulations that the linear corotation torque has a non-negligible\ndependency upon the temperature gradient, in a locally isothermal disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 16:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-14"}

The key assumption is that each system A can be paired with an\nisomorphic $\\textit{conjugate}$ system, $\\overline{A}$, by means of a\nnon-signaling bipartite state $\\eta_A$ perfectly and uniformly correlating each\nbasic measurement on A with its counterpart on $\\overline{A}$.

A second\ningredient is the notion of a $\\textit{reversible filter}$, that is, a\nprobabilistically reversible process that independently attenuates the\nsensitivity of detectors associated with a measurement. In addition to offering\nmore flexibility than most existing reconstructions of finite-dimensional\nquantum theory, the approach taken here has the advantage of not relying on any\nform of the \"no restriction\" hypothesis. That is, it is not assumed that\narbitrary effects are physically measurable, nor that arbitrary families of\nphysically measurable effects summing to the unit effect, represent physically\naccessible observables.

For a Dirac fermion,\nelectromagnetic dipoles are possible, but are very constrained. For Majorana\nfermions, no such terms are allowed. We consider signals of an effective theory\nwith a Majorana dark matter particle and its couplings to photons. In the\npresence of a nearby excited state, there is the possibility of a magnetic\ndipole transition (Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter or MiDM), which yields both\ndirect and indirect detection signals, and, intriguingly, yields essentially\nthe same size over a wide range of dipole strengths. Absent an excited state,\nthe leading interaction of WIMPs is similar to the Rayleigh scattering of low\nenergy photons from neutral atoms, which may be captured by an effective\noperator of dimension 7 of the form $\\bar{\\chi}\\chi F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\nWhile it can be thought of as a phase of the Magnetic inelastic Dark Matter\nscenario where the excited state is much heavier than the ground state, it can\narise from other theories as well.

One of the results of the application of CLaSPS\nto the CSC+ is the re-identification of a well-known correlation between the\nalphaOX parameter and the near ultraviolet color, in a subset of CSC+ sources\nwith relatively small values of the near-ultraviolet colors. The other dataset\nconsists of a sample of blazars for which photometric observations in the\noptical, mid and near infrared are available, complemented for a subset of the\nsources, by Fermi gamma-ray data. The main results of the application of CLaSPS\nto such datasets have been the discovery of a strong correlation between the\nmulti-wavelength color distribution of blazars and their optical spectral\nclassification in BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and a peculiar\npattern followed by blazars in the WISE mid-infrared colors space. This pattern\nand its physical interpretation have been discussed in details in other papers\nby one of the authors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Yet, as stars evolve off the main\nsequence their vulnerability to tidal disruption increases drastically as they\ndevelop a bifurcated structure consisting of a dense core and a tenuous\nenvelope. Here we present the first hydrodynamic simulations of the tidal\ndisruption of giant stars and show that the core has a substantial influence on\nthe star's ability to survive the encounter. Stars with more massive cores\nretain large fractions of their envelope mass, even in deep encounters.\nAccretion flares resulting from the disruption of giant stars should last for\ntens to hundreds of years. Their characteristic signature in transient searches\nwould not be the $t^{-5/3}$ decay typically associated with tidal disruption\nevents, but a correlated rise over many orders of magnitude in brightness on\nmonths to years timescales. We calculate the relative disruption rates of stars\nof varying evolutionary stages in typical galactic centers, then use our\nresults to produce Monte Carlo realizations of the expected flaring event\npopulations. We find that the demographics of tidal disruption flares are\nstrongly dependent on both stellar and black hole mass, especially near the\nlimiting SMBH mass scale of $\\sim 10^8 M_\\odot$. At this black hole mass, we\npredict a sharp transition in the SMBH flaring diet beyond which all observable\ndisruptions arise from evolved stars, accompanied by a dramatic cutoff in the\noverall tidal disruption flaring rate. Black holes less massive than this\nlimiting mass scale will show observable flares from both main sequence and\nevolved stars, with giants contributing up to 10% of the event rate. The\nrelative fractions of stars disrupted at different evolutionary states can\nconstrain the properties and distributions of stars in galactic nuclei other\nthan our own.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

For many of these mechanisms, which are often\nreferred to as truthful-in-expectation, incentive compatibility is contingent\non the assumption that agents are risk-neutral. These mechanisms have been\ncriticized on the grounds that this assumption is too strong, because \"real\"\nagents are typically risk averse, and moreover their precise attitude towards\nrisk is typically unknown a-priori. In response, researchers in algorithmic\nmechanism design have sought the design of universally-truthful mechanisms ---\nmechanisms for which incentive-compatibility makes no assumptions regarding\nagents' attitudes towards risk.\n  We show that any truthful-in-expectation mechanism can be generically\ntransformed into a mechanism that is incentive compatible even when agents are\nrisk averse, without modifying the mechanism's allocation rule. The transformed\nmechanism does not require reporting of agents' risk profiles.

The challenge is to overcome the\nmultipath-barrier with redundancy in order to provide the desired accuracies\nespecially under severe multipath conditions when the fraction of received\nsignals corrupted by multipath is dominating. We invoke a analytical graphical\nmodel framework based on particle filtering and reveal its high accuracy\nlocalization promise through simulations. We also address design questions such\nas \"How many anchors and what fraction of line-of-sight (LOS) measurements are\nneeded to achieve a specified target accuracy?\", by analytically characterizing\nthe performance improvement in localization accuracy as a function of the\nnumber of nodes in the network and the fraction of LOS measurements. In\nparticular, for a static node placement, we show that the Cramer-Rao Lower\nBound (CRLB), a fundamental lower bound on the localization accuracy, can be\nexpressed as a product of two factors - a scalar function that depends only on\nthe parameters of the noise distribution and a matrix that depends only on the\ngeometry of node locations and the underlying connectivity graph. Further, a\nsimplified expression is obtained for the CRLB that helps deduce the scaling\nbehavior of the estimation error as a function of the number of agents and\nanchors in the network. The bound suggests that even a small fraction of LOS\nmeasurements can provide significant improvements. Conversely, a small fraction\nof NLOS measurements can significantly degrade the performance.

We consider a modified formulation in which every\nleader is cognizant of the equilibrium constraints of all leaders. Equilibria\nof this modified game contain the equilibria, if any, of the original game. The\nnew formulation has a constraint structure called shared constraints, and our\nmain result shows that if the leader objectives admit a potential function, the\nglobal minimizers of the potential function over the shared constraint are\nequilibria of the modified formulation. We provide another existence result\nusing fixed point theory that does not require potentiality.

Dithered quantizers have\ntraditionally been considered within their natural setting of uniform\nquantization. In this paper we extend conventional dithered quantization to\nnonuniform quantization, via a subterfage: dithering is performed in the\ncompanded domain. Closed form necessary conditions for optimality of the\ncompressor and expander mappings are derived for both fixed and variable rate\nrandomized quantization. Numerically, mappings are optimized by iteratively\nimposing these necessary conditions. The framework is extended to include an\nexplicit constraint that deterministic or randomized quantizers yield\nreconstruction error that is uncorrelated with the source. Surprising\ntheoretical results show direct and simple connection between the optimal\nconstrained quantizers and their unconstrained counterparts. Numerical results\nfor the Gaussian source provide strong evidence that the proposed constrained\nrandomized quantizer outperforms the conventional dithered quantizer, as well\nas the constrained deterministic quantizer. Moreover, the proposed constrained\nquantizer renders the reconstruction error nearly white. In the second part of\nthe paper, we investigate whether uncorrelated reconstruction error requires\nrandom coding to achieve asymptotic optimality. We show that for a Gaussian\nsource, the optimal vector quantizer of asymptotically high dimension whose\nquantization error is uncorrelated with the source, is indeed random. Thus,\nrandom encoding in this setting of rate-distortion theory, is not merely a tool\nto characterize performance bounds, but a required property of quantizers that\napproach such bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 00:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

As a consequence,\n'granular' or differential effective medium theory predicts the conductivity of\nthis media within 10% at the jamming point; in contrast, strong enhancement of\ntransport near interparticle contacts in packed-sphere composites results in\nconductivity divergence at the jamming onset. The results are expected to be\nparticularly relevant to the development of nanomaterials, where nanoparticle\nbuilding blocks can exhibit a variety of faceted shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 02:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

Alongside with the minimum entropy, action, and the\npresence of the Winn-Ehrenfest adiabatic invariant (AI), the fluctuations\nrequire the Gilbert information (probabilistic) space linking the physical and\nthe reciprocal ST. Physical quantities in the information space are represented\nby linear Hermitian operators, which is due to the entropy production in the\npresence of an AI.

So far\nthese have been used to study the abundances of these molecules in space.\nHowever, in order to obtain more accurate final compositions in these media, we\nfind out the rate coefficients for the formation of some of the most important\ninterstellar pre-biotic molecules by using quantum chemical theory. We use\nthese rates inside our hydro-chemical model to find out the chemical evolution\nand the final abundances of the pre-biotic species during the collapsing phase\nof a proto-star. We find that a significant amount of various pre-biotic\nmolecules could be produced during the collapsing phase of a proto-star. We\nstudy extensively the formation these molecules via successive neutral-neutral\nand radical-radical/radical-molecular reactions. We present the time evolution\nof the chemical species with an emphasis on how the production of these\nmolecules varies with the depth of a cloud. We compare the formation of adenine\nin the interstellar space using our rate-coefficients and using those obtained\nfrom the existing theoretical models. Formation routes of the pre-biotic\nmolecules are found to be highly dependent on the abundances of the reactive\nspecies and the rate coefficients involved in the reactions. Presence of grains\nstrongly affect the abundances of the gas phase species. We also carry out a\ncomparative study between different pathways available for the synthesis of\nadenine, alanine, glycine and other molecules considered in our network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 08:01:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 08:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The main result contained in the\npaper is a general expression for the outage probability, which is a functional\nof the Mellin transforms of the per-hop channel gains. Furthermore, we\nexplicitly calculate the asymptotic outage probability for four different\nsystems, whereby in each system the per-hop channels adhere to either a\nNakagami-m, Weibull, Rician, or Hoyt fading profile, but where the\ndistributional parameters may differ from hop to hop.

We exploit this\nformula to analyze an example scenario for a four-hop system where the per-hop\nchannels follow the four aforementioned fading models, i.e., the first channel\nis Nakagami-m fading, the second is Weibull fading, and so on.

In quiescence and\noutburst, the star presents many permitted emission lines, including typical\nCTTS lines and numerous neutral and ionized metallic lines. During the\noutburst, the number of emission lines increases to over a thousand, with\nnarrow plus broad component structure (NC+BC). The BC profile is highly\nvariable on short timescales (24-72h). An active chromosphere can explain the\nmetallic lines in quiescence and the outburst NC. The dynamics of the BC line\nprofiles suggest an origin in a hot, dense, non-axisymmetric, and non-uniform\naccretion column that suffers velocity variations along the line-of-sight on\ntimescales of days. Assuming Keplerian rotation, the emitting region would be\nlocated at ~0.1-0.2 AU, consistent with the inner disk rim, but the velocity\nprofiles of the lines reveal a combination of rotation and infall. Line ratios\nof ions and neutrals can be reproduced with a temperature of T~6500 K for\nelectron densities of a few times 10$^{12}$cm$^{-3}$ in the line-emitting\nregion. The data confirm that the 2008 outburst was an episode of increased\naccretion, albeit much stronger than previous EX Lupi and typical EXors\noutbursts. The line profiles are consistent with the infall/rotation of a\nnon-axisymmetric structure that could be produced by clumpy accretion during\nthe outburst phase. A strong inner disk wind appears in the epochs of higher\naccretion.

On the other\nhand, we generalize them to systems consisting of arbitrary number of qubits.\nIn particular, we provide criteria for separability of such states formulated\nin terms of their ranks. Interestingly, for most of the cases, the symmetric\nstates are either separable or typically separable. Then, edge states in these\nsystems are studied, showing in particular that to characterize generic PPT\nentangled states with four and five qubits, it is enough to study only those\nthat assume few (respectively, two and three) specific configurations of ranks.\nFinally, we numerically search for extremal PPT entangled states in such\nsystems consisting of up to 23 qubits. One can clearly notice regularity behind\nthe ranks of such extremal states, and, in particular, for systems composed of\nodd number of qubits we find a single configuration of ranks for which there\nare extremal states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 12:34:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 22:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-29"}

Moreover, the\nabsorption line is non-Lorenzian. We obtain an explicit expression for the\nabsorption line for any angular velocity of the absorber.\n  The analysis of the experimental results, in all previous experiments which\ndid not observe the full absorption line itself, were wrong and the conclusions\ndoubtful. The only proper experiment was done by K\\\"{u}ndig (Phys. Rev. 129\n(1963) 2371), who observed the broadening, but associated it to random\nvibrations of the absorber. We establish necessary conditions for the\nsuccessful measurement of a transverse second order Doppler shift by\nM\\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy. We indicate how the results of such an experiment\ncan be used to verify the existence of a Doppler shift due to acceleration and\nto test the validity of Einstein's clock hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 13:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-15"}

The interaction position is determined by\nsaddle point, which is equivalent to conservation of the canonical momentum for\nthe interacting particles, and leads to conservation of their conformal\ncharges. We further show that for large dimensions the rms size of the\ninteraction region is small compared to the radius of curvature of the AdS\nspace, but still large compared to the string Compton wave-length. Hence, one\ncan approximate the string vertex operators as flat-space vertex operators with\na definite momentum, which depends on the conformal and R-charges of the\noperator. We then argue that the string vertex operator dual to a primary\noperator is chosen by satisfying a twisted version of Q^L=Q^R, up to spurious\nterms. This leads to a unique choice for a scalar vertex operator with the\nappropriate charges at the first massive level.

In\nparticular we investigate modal logics for such models and their expressive\npower in terms of the bisimulation that can be captured. The geometric model of\nconcurrency is interesting from two main reasons: its generality and\nexpressiveness, and the natural way in which autoconcurrency and action\nrefinement are captured. Logics for this model, though, are not well\ninvestigated, where a simple, yet adequate, modal logic over HDAs was only\nrecently introduced. As this modal logic, with two existential modalities,\nduring and after, captures only split bisimulation, which is rather low in the\nspectrum of van Glabbeek and Vaandrager, the immediate question was what small\nextension of this logic could capture the more fine-grained hereditary history\npreserving bisimulation (hh)? In response, the work in this paper provides\nseveral insights. One is the fact that the geometrical aspect of HDAs makes it\npossible to use for capturing the hh-bisimulation, a standard modal logic that\ndoes not employ event variables, opposed to the two logics (over less\nexpressive models) that we compare with. The logic that we investigate here\nuses standard past modalities and extends the previously introduced logic\n(called HDML) that had only forward, action-labelled, modalities. Besides, we\ntry to understand better the above issues by introducing a related model that\nwe call ST-configuration structures, which extend the configuration structures\nof van Glabbeek and Plotkin. We relate this model to HDAs, and redefine and\nprove the earlier results in the light of this new model. These offer a\ndifferent view on why the past modalities and geometrical concurrency capture\nthe hereditary history preserving bisimulation. Additional correlating insights\nare also gained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 15:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Two different views attempt\nto interpret and explain the large variability of colors, hence surface\ncomposition.

To\ndate, no mechanism has been found that successfully explains why Centaurs,\nwhich are escapees from the Kuiper Belt, exhibit two distinct color groups,\nwhereas KBOs do not.

Structures in debris disks induced by planetdisk interaction are\npromising to provide valuable constraints on the existence and properties of\nembedded planets. Aims. We investigate the observability of structures in\ndebris disks induced by planet-disk interaction. Methods. The observability of\ndebris disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is\nstudied on the basis of a simple analytical disk model. Furthermore, N-body\nsimulations are used to model the spatial dust distribution in debris disks\nunder the influence of planet-disk interaction. Images at optical scattered\nlight to millimeter thermal re-emission are computed. Available information\nabout the expected capabilities of ALMA and the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST) are used to investigate the observability of characteristic disk\nstructures through spatially resolved imaging. Results. Planet-disk interaction\ncan result in prominent structures. This provides the opportunity of detecting\nand characterizing extrasolar planets in a range of masses and radial distances\nfrom the star that is not accessible to other techniques. Facilities that will\nbe available in the near future are shown to provide the capabilities to\nspatially resolve and characterize structures in debris disks. Limitations are\nrevealed and suggestions for possible instrument setups and observing\nstrategies are given. In particular, ALMA is limited by its sensitivity to\nsurface brightness, which requires a trade-off between sensitivity and spatial\nresolution.

Each player can pick among multiple arms.\nWhen a player picks an arm, it gets a reward. We consider both i.i.d. reward\nmodel and Markovian reward model. In the i.i.d. model each arm is modelled as\nan i.i.d. process with an unknown distribution with an unknown mean. In the\nMarkovian model, each arm is modelled as a finite, irreducible, aperiodic and\nreversible Markov chain with an unknown probability transition matrix and\nstationary distribution. The arms give different rewards to different players.\nIf two players pick the same arm, there is a \"collision\", and neither of them\nget any reward. There is no dedicated control channel for coordination or\ncommunication among the players. Any other communication between the users is\ncostly and will add to the regret. We propose an online index-based distributed\nlearning policy called ${\\tt dUCB_4}$ algorithm that trades off\n\\textit{exploration v. exploitation} in the right way, and achieves expected\nregret that grows at most as near-$O(\\log^2 T)$. The motivation comes from\nopportunistic spectrum access by multiple secondary users in cognitive radio\nnetworks wherein they must pick among various wireless channels that look\ndifferent to different users. This is the first distributed learning algorithm\nfor multi-player MABs to the best of our knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 07:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}
