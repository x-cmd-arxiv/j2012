We vary the Mach number of the shock, the density contrast of the\nclouds, and the ratio of total cloud mass to inter-cloud mass within the clumpy\nregion. Cloud material becomes incorporated into the flow. This \"mass-loading\"\nreduces the Mach number of the shock, and leads to the formation of a dense\nshell. In cases in which the mass-loading is sufficient the flow slows enough\nthat the shock degenerates into a wave. The interaction evolves through up to\nfour stages: initially the shock decelerates; then its speed is nearly\nconstant; next the shock accelerates as it leaves the clumpy region; finally it\nmoves at a constant speed close to its initial speed. Turbulence is generated\nin the post-shock flow as the shock sweeps through the clumpy region.

On the extended configuration\nspace M for classical field theory composed of spacetime and field\nconfiguration space, one can define a geometrical structure called Kawaguchi\nareal metric K from the field Lagrangian and (M,K) can be regarded as Kawaguchi\nmanifold. The geometrical action functional is given by K and the dynamics of\nfield is determined by covariant Euler-Lagrange equation derived from the\nvariational principle of the action. The solution to the equation becomes a\nminimal hypersurface on (M,K) which has the same dimension as spacetime. We\npropose that this hypersurface is what we should regard as our real spacetime\nmanifold, while the usual way to understand spacetime is to consider it as the\nparameter spacetime (base manifold) of a fibre bundle. In this way, the\ndynamics of field and spacetime structure is unified by Kawaguchi geometry. The\ntheory has the property of strong covariance, which means that it allows one to\nchoose arbitrary parameter spacetime from the total extended configuration\nspace. In other words, we can take more wider class of coordinate\ntransformations such that mix spacetime and field variables which are forbidden\nto be exchanged in conventional formalism. In this aspect, we call our\nformalism fibration-free.

In\ncontrast to their longitudinal refraction indices, the transverse indices of\nthe neutral mesons are larger than unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 16:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 18:38:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 09:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Yet, this\ndysregulation of bone remodelling does not occur equally in all bone regions.\nLoss of bone is more pronounced near and at the endocortex, leading to cortical\nwall thinning and medullary cavity expansion, a process sometimes referred to\nas \"trabecularisation\" or \"cancellisation\". Cortical wall thinning is of\nprimary concern in osteoporosis due to the strong deterioration of bone\nmechanical properties that it is associated with. In this paper, we examine the\npossibility that the non-uniformity of microscopic bone surface availability\ncould explain the non-uniformity of bone loss in osteoporosis. We use a\ncomputational model of bone remodelling in which microscopic bone surface\navailability influences bone turnover rate and simulate the evolution of the\nbone volume fraction profile across the midshaft of a long bone. We find that\nbone loss is accelerated near the endocortical wall where the specific surface\nis highest. Over time, this leads to a substantial reduction of cortical wall\nthickness from the endosteum. The associated expansion of the medullary cavity\ncan be made to match experimentally observed cross-sectional data from the\nMelbourne Femur Collection. Finally, we calculate the redistribution of the\nmechanical stresses in this evolving bone structure and show that mechanical\nload becomes critically transferred to the periosteal cortical bone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 18:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 17:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

In this first paper in a series, the methodology\nemployed to establish cluster parameters for the envisioned database are\nelaborated upon by analyzing a subsample of 4 known young open clusters: Danks\n1, Danks 2, RCW 79, and DBS 132.

At a spectral\nresolution of R~100,000, we trace the change in the radial velocity of the\nplanet over a large range in phase, determining an orbital inclination of\ni=44.5+-1.5 degrees and a true planet mass of 5.95+-0.28 MJup. This result\nextends atmospheric characterisation to non-transiting planets. The strong\nabsorption signal points to an atmosphere with a temperature that is decreasing\ntowards higher altitudes. This is a stark contrast to the temperature inversion\ninvoked for other highly irradiated planets, and supports models in which the\nabsorbing compounds believed to cause such atmospheric inversions are destroyed\nby the ultraviolet emission from the active host star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 20:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This would seem to imply that massive black holes formed\nbefore low mass black holes, in apparent contradiction to hierarchical\nclustering scenarios. We investigate whether this observed \"downsizing\" in BH\ngrowth is reproduced in a semi-analytic model for the formation and evolution\nof galaxies and black holes, set within the hierarchical paradigm for structure\nformation (Somerville et al. 2008; S08). In this model, black holes evolve from\nlight seeds (\\sim100M\\odot) and their growth is merger-driven. The original S08\nmodel (baseline model) reproduces the number density of AGN at intermediate\nredshifts and luminosities, but underproduces luminous AGN at very high\nredshift (z > 3) and overproduces them at low redshift (z < 1). In addition,\nthe baseline model underproduces low-luminosity AGN at low redshift (z < 1). To\nsolve these problems we consider several modifications to the physical\nprocesses in the model: (1) a 'heavy' black hole seeding scenario (2) a\nsub-Eddington accretion rate ceiling that depends on the cold gas fraction, and\n(3) an additional black hole accretion mode due to disk instabilities. With\nthese three modifications, the models can explain the observed downsizing,\nsuccessfully reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity function and\nsimultaneously reproduce galaxy and black hole properties in the local\nUniverse. We also perform a comparison with the observed soft and hard X-ray\nluminosity functions of AGN, including an empirical correction for torus-level\nobscuration, and reach similar conclusions. Our best-fit model suggests a\nscenario in which disk instabilities are the main driver for moderately\nluminous Seyfert galaxies at low redshift, while major mergers are the main\ntrigger for luminous AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 20:02:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 14:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

These LBGs at z=1-3 are selected using dropout selection\ncriteria similar to high redshift LBGs. The deep multi-band photometry in this\nfield is used to identify best-fit SED models, from which we infer the\nfollowing results: (1) the photometric redshift estimate of these dropout\nselected LBGs is accurate to within few percent; (2) the UV spectral slope\n(beta) is redder than at high redshift (z>3), where LBGs are less dusty; (3) on\naverage, LBGs at z=1-3 are massive, dustier and more highly star-forming,\ncompared to LBGs at higher redshifts with similar luminosities\n(0.1L*<~L<~2.5L*), though their median values are similar within 1-sigma\nuncertainties.

A crucial constraint on such scenarios arises because\nparticle production can also source inflaton perturbations, and might ruin the\nusual predictions for a nearly scale invariant spectrum of nearly Gaussian\ncurvature fluctuations. To minimize this effect, we consider two models of\nparticle production in a sector that is only gravitationally coupled to the\ninflaton. For a single instantaneous burst of massive particle production, we\nfind that localized features in the scalar spectrum and bispectrum might be\nobservable, but gravitational wave signatures are unlikely to be detectable\n(due to the suppressed quadrupole moment of non-relativistic quanta) without\ninvoking some additional effects. We also consider a model with a rolling\npseudoscalar that leads to a continuous production of relativistic gauge field\nfluctuations during inflation. Here we find that gravitational waves from\nparticle production can actually exceed the usual inflationary vacuum\nfluctuations in a regime where non-Gaussianity is consistent with observational\nlimits.

Problems in which the\nbound to be traversed is itself a fluctuating function of time include widely\nstudied settings in neural coding, such as neuronal integrators with irregular\ninputs and internal noise. We show that the probability p(t) that a\nGauss-Markov process will first exceed the boundary at time t suffers a phase\ntransition as a function of the roughness of the boundary, as measured by its\nH\\\"older exponent H, with critical value Hc = 1/2. For smoother boundaries, H >\n1/2, the probability density is a continuous func- tion of time. For rougher\nboundaries, H < 1/2, the probability is concentrated on a Cantor-like set of\nzero measure: the probability density becomes divergent, almost everywhere\neither zero or infin- ity. The critical point Hc = 1/2 corresponds to a\nwidely-studied case in the theory of neural coding, where the external input\nintegrated by a model neuron is a white-noise process, such as uncorrelated but\nprecisely balanced excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We argue this transition\ncorresponds to a sharp boundary between rate codes, in which the neural firing\nprobability varies smoothly, and temporal codes, in which the neuron fires at\nsharply-defined times regardless of the intensity of internal noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 21:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In order to simultaneously\npredict the shape, amplitude and timing of a solar cycle by implementing an\nEnsemble Kalman Filter in the framework of Data Assimilation Research Testbed\n(DART), it is important to know the model's sensitivity to flow variation.\nGuided by observations we consider a smooth increase or decrease in meridional\nflow speed for a specified time (a few months to a few years), after which the\nflow speed comes back to the steady speed, and implement that time-varying\nmeridional flow at different phases of solar cycle.

However, we\nshow that this adaptation is useless from a capacity region perspective and\ncapacity is achieved by strategies where the channel inputs at each use do not\nadapt to previous inputs. Finally, we consider the Gaussian two-way IC, and\nshow that partial adaptation is useless when the interference is very strong.\nIn the strong and weak interference regimes, we show that the non-adaptive Han\nand Kobayashi scheme utilized in parallel in both directions achieves to within\na constant gap for the symmetric rate of the fully (some regimes) or partially\n(remaining regimes) adaptive models.\n  The central technical contribution is the derivation of new, computable outer\nbounds which allow for adaptation. Inner bounds follow from non-adaptive\nachievability schemes of the corresponding one-way channel models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 00:20:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 15:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

But if the session key is compromised, the confidentiality of\nencrypted messages is typically compromised as well. Without quantum mechanics,\nkey establishment can only be done under the assumption that some computational\nproblem is hard. Since digital communication can be easily eavesdropped and\nrecorded, it is important to consider the secrecy of information anticipating\nfuture algorithmic and computational discoveries which could break the secrecy\nof past keys, violating the secrecy of the confidential channel.\n  Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used generate secret keys that are\nsecure against any future algorithmic or computational improvements. QKD\nprotocols still require authentication of classical communication, however,\nwhich is most easily achieved using computationally secure digital signature\nschemes. It is generally considered folklore that QKD when used with\ncomputationally secure authentication is still secure against an unbounded\nadversary, provided the adversary did not break the authentication during the\nrun of the protocol.\n  We describe a security model for quantum key distribution based on\ntraditional classical authenticated key exchange (AKE) security models. Using\nour model, we characterize the long-term security of the BB84 QKD protocol with\ncomputationally secure authentication against an eventually unbounded\nadversary. By basing our model on traditional AKE models, we can more readily\ncompare the relative merits of various forms of QKD and existing classical AKE\nprotocols.

In this paper, we try to address the tradeoff\nbetween sensing the primary channel for $\\tau$ seconds of the time slot\nproceeded by randomly accessing it and randomly accessing primary channel\nwithout sensing to avoid wasting $\\tau$ seconds in sensing. The SU senses\nprimary channel to exploit the periods of silence, if the primary user (PU) is\ndeclared to be idle the SU randomly accesses the channel with some access\nprobability $a_s$. In addition to randomly accesses the channel if the PU is\nsensed to be idle, it possibly accesses it if the channel is declared to be\nbusy with some access probability $b_s$. This is because the probability of\nfalse alarm and misdetection cause significant secondary throughput degradation\nand affect the PU QoS. We propose variable sensing duration schemes where the\nSU optimizes over the optimal sensing time to achieve the maximum stable\nthroughput for both primary and secondary queues.

After\nestablishing the $\\om$-index decreasing property of the solutions in $\\bb$ for\nfixed $e\\in [0,1)$, we prove the existence of three curves located from left to\nright in the rectangle $[0,9]\\times [0,1)$, among which two are -1 degeneracy\ncurves and the third one is the right envelop curve of the $\\om$-degeneracy\ncurves for $\\om\\not=1$, and show that the linear stability pattern of such\nelliptic Lagrangian solutions changes if and only if the parameter $(\\bb,e)$\npasses through each of these three curves. Interesting symmetries of these\ncurves are also observed. The singular case when the eccentricity $e$\napproaches to 1 is also analyzed in details concerning the linear stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 03:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 01:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

The case is not as clear for lower-dispersion\nsystems such as low-mass galaxies and globular clusters. Here we suggest that\nabove a critical velocity dispersion of roughly 40 km/s, massive central black\nholes will form in relaxed stellar systems at any cosmic epoch. This is because\nabove this dispersion primordial binaries cannot support the system against\ndeep core collapse. If, as previous simulations show, the black holes formed in\nthe cluster settle to produce a dense subcluster, then given the extremely high\ndensities reached during core collapse the holes will merge with each other.\nFor low velocity dispersions and hence low cluster escape speeds, mergers will\ntypically kick out all or all but one of the holes due to three-body kicks or\nthe asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation. If one hole remains, it\nwill tidally disrupt stars at a high rate. If none remain, one is formed after\nrunaway collisions between stars, then it tidally disrupts stars at a high\nrate. The accretion rate after disruption is many orders of magnitude above\nEddington. If, as several studies suggest, the hole can accept matter at that\nrate because the generated radiation is trapped and advected, then it will grow\nquickly and form a massive central black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 04:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The experiment will take place at the\nLaboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc (LSC), Spain. NEXT-100 uses\nelectroluminescence (EL) technology for energy measurement with a resolution\nbetter than 1% FWHM. The gaseous xenon in the TPC additionally allows the\ntracks of the two beta particles to be recorded, which are expected to have a\nlength of up to 30 cm at 10 bar pressure. The ability to record the topological\nsignature of the neutrinoless double-beta events provides a powerful background\nrejection factor for the double-beta experiment.\n  In this paper, we present a novel 3D imaging concept using SiPMs coated with\ntetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) for the EL read out and its first implementation in\nNEXT-DEMO, a large-scale prototype of the NEXT-100 experiment. The design and\nthe first characterization measurements of the NEXT-DEMO SiPM tracking system\nare presented. The SiPM response uniformity over the tracking plane drawn from\nits gain map is shown to be better than 4%. An automated active control system\nfor the stabilization of the SiPMs gain was developed, based on the voltage\nsupply compensation of the gain drifts. The gain is shown to be stabilized\nwithin 0.2% relative variation around its nominal value, provided by Hamamatsu,\nin a temperature range of 10 degree C. The noise level from the electronics and\nthe SiPM dark noise is shown to lay typically below the level of 10\nphotoelectrons (pe) in the ADC. Hence, a detection threshold at 10 pe is set\nfor the acquisition of the tracking signals. The ADC full dynamic range (4096\nchannels) is shown to be adequate for signal levels of up to 200\npe/microsecond, which enables recording most of the tracking signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 08:17:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 14:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The management of VM comprises computing resources\nexploitation in the monitoring of VM in entire lifecycle and physical resources\nmanagement for VM on SMDs. Therefore, VM migration based application offloading\nrequires additional computing resource. Consequently computing resources demand\nand execution time of the application increases respectively. In this paper, we\nempirically review the impact of VM deployment and management on the execution\ntime of application in diverse scenarios. We investigate VM deployment and\nmanagement for application processing in simulation environment by employing\nCloudSim: a simulation toolkit that provides an extensible simulation framework\nto model VM deployment and management for application processing in cloud\ninfrastructure. The significance of this work is to ensure that VM deployment\nand management necessitates additional computing resources on SMD for\napplication offloading.

Using phase reduction and Floquet multipliers, we\nnumerically analyzed their entrainability under different coupling strengths\nand period ratios. We found that a period mismatch induces better entrainment\nin both types of oscillator; the enhancement occurs in the vicinity of the\nbifurcation on their limit cycles. In the smooth oscillator, the optimal period\nratio for the enhancement coincides with the experimentally observed ratio,\nwhich suggests biological exploitation of the period mismatch. Although the\norigin of multiple feedback loops is often explained as a passive mechanism to\nensure robustness against perturbation, we study the active benefits of the\nperiod mismatch, which include increasing the efficiency of the genetic\noscillators.

The capacity of a gel network\nto crack during drying depends on the existence and significance of a pressure\ngradient in the pore liquid; in addition it depends on the way the gel relaxes\nthe resulting drying stresses. In this paper the effect of a binary mixture of\nsolvents saturating the gel network on the crack patterns formation is\ninvestigated. Indeed, incorporation of a small quantity of non-volatile\ncosolvent, i.e. glycerol, inhibits drying-induced cracks; moreover addition of\na concentration greater than 10% to a colloidal dispersion leads to a crack\nfree coating in room conditions. Mass variation with time reveals that both\nevaporation rate and cracking time are not affected by glycerol, in the range\nof added glycerol contents studied. In addition measurements of mechanical\nproperties show that the elastic modulus is reduced with glycerol content. The\ndecrease of the number of cracks with the glycerol content is related to the\nflattening of the pressure gradient in the pore liquid. The mechanism is shown\nto be due to the combination of two processes: flow driven by the pressure\ngradient and diffusion mechanisms in accordance with Scherer work (1989).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 12:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}

Our previous observations using the VLTI and AMBER\nin the medium resolution K-band mode spatially resolved the environment of HD\n327083. The continuum visibilities obtained indicate the presence of a\ncircumbinary disc. CO bandhead emission was also observed. However, due to the\nlimited spectral resolution of the previous observations, the kinematic\nstructure of the emitting material was not constrained. In this paper, we\naddress this and probe the source of the CO emission with high spectral\nresolution and spatial precision. We have observed HD 327083 with high spectral\nresolution (25 & 6 km/s) using AMBER and CRIRES. The observations are compared\nto kinematical models to constrain the source of the emission. It is shown that\nthe CO bandhead emission can be reproduced using a model of a Keplerian disc\nwith an inclination and size consistent with our previous VLTI observations.\nThe model is compared to AMBER differential phase measurements, which have a\nprecision as high as 30-micro-arcseconds. A differential phase signal\ncorresponding to 0.15 milli-arcseconds (~5 sigma) is seen over the bandhead\nemission, which is in excellent agreement with the model that fits the CRIRES\nobservations. In comparison, a model of an equatorial outflow, as envisaged in\nthe standard sgB[e] scenario, does not reproduce the observations well. The\nexcellent agreement between the disc model and observations in the spatial and\nspectral domains is compelling evidence that the CO bandhead emission of HD\n327083 originates in a circumbinary Keplerian disc. In contrast, the model of\nan equatorial outflow cannot reproduce the observations well. This suggests\nthat the standard sgB[e] scenario is not applicable to HD 327083, which\nsupports the hypothesis that the B[e] behaviour of HD 327083 is due to binarity\n(ABRIDGED).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 13:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We build on our prior work\nwith general value functions (GVFs) and the Horde architecture. GVFs have been\nshown able to represent a wide variety of facts about the world's dynamics that\nmay be useful to a long-lived agent (Sutton et al. 2011). We have also\npreviously shown scaling - that thousands of on-policy GVFs can be learned\naccurately in real-time on a mobile robot (Modayil, White & Sutton 2011). That\nwork was limited in that it learned about only one policy at a time, whereas\nthe greatest potential benefits of life-long learning come from learning about\nmany policies in parallel, as we explore in this paper. Many new challenges\narise in this off-policy learning setting. To deal with convergence and\nefficiency challenges, we utilize the recently introduced GTD({\\lambda})\nalgorithm. We show that GTD({\\lambda}) with tile coding can simultaneously\nlearn hundreds of predictions for five simple target policies while following a\nsingle random behavior policy, assessing accuracy with interspersed on-policy\ntests. To escape the need for the tests, which preclude further scaling, we\nintroduce and empirically vali- date two online estimators of the off-policy\nobjective (MSPBE). Finally, we use the more efficient of the two estimators to\ndemonstrate off-policy learning at scale - the learning of value functions for\none thousand policies in real time on a physical robot.

Frequently, the\nsystem's state influences the driving noise intensity, as, for example, the\nactual value of a commodity may alter its volatility or the concentration of\ngene products may regulate their expression. All these phenomena are often\nmodeled using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). However, an SDE is not\nsufficient to fully describe a noisy system with a multiplicative feedback,\nbecause it can be interpreted according to various conventions -- in\nparticular, It\\^{o} calculus and Stratonovitch calculus --, each of which leads\nto a qualitatively different solution. Which convention to adopt must be\ndetermined case by case on the basis of the available experimental data; for\nexample, the SDE describing electrical circuits driven by a noise are known to\nobey Stratonovich calculus. Once such an SDE-convention pair is determined, it\nc an be employed to predict the system's behavior under new conditions. Here,\nwe experimentally demonstrate that the convention for a given physical system\nmay actually vary under varying operational conditions. We show that, under\ncertain conditions, a noisy electric circuit shifts to obey It\\^o calculus,\nwhich may dramatically alter the system's long term stability. We track such\nStratonovich-to-It\\^o transition to the underlying dynamics of the system and,\nin particular, to the ratio between the driving noise correlation time and the\nfeedback delay time. We briefly discuss ramifications of our conclusions for\nbiology and economics: the possibility of similar transitions and their\ndramatic consequences should be recognized and accounted for where SDEs are\nemployed to predict the evolution of complex phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 14:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}

While atmospheric hydrogen is not\ndetected in the first epoch observations, it is observed at the second epoch,\nproducing a transit absorption depth of 14.4+/-3.6% between velocities of -230\nto -140 km/s. Contrary to HD 209458b, these high velocities cannot arise from\nradiation pressure alone and require an additional acceleration mechanism, such\nas interactions with stellar wind protons. The observed absorption can be\nexplained by an atmospheric escape rate of neutral hydrogen atoms of about 10^9\ng/s, a stellar wind with a velocity of 190 km/s and a temperature of ~10^5K.\n  An X-ray flare from the active star seen with Swift/XRT 8 hours before the\nsecond-epoch observation supports the idea that the observed changes within the\nupper atmosphere of the planet can be caused by variations in the stellar wind\nproperties, or by variations in the stellar energy input to the planetary\nescaping gas (or a mix of the two effects). These observations provide the\nfirst indication of interaction between the exoplanet's atmosphere and stellar\nvariations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 14:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We integrate over all possible values of the Lorentz\nfactor the values of the kinetic energy corresponding to each component. The\ncalculation of the mass in the ejection is carried out by assuming the minimum\nenergy state.

These\ncan be generally divided into two types: The first is linear classifiers, such\nas support vector machines, which are well studied and provide state-of-the-art\nresults. One shortcoming of these models is that their output (known as the\n'margin') is not calibrated, and cannot be translated naturally into a\ndistribution over the labels. Thus, it is difficult to incorporate such models\nas components of larger systems, unlike probabilistic based approaches. The\nsecond type of approach constructs class conditional distributions using a\nnonlinearity (e.g. log-linear models), but is occasionally worse in terms of\nclassification error. We propose a supervised learning method which combines\nthe best of both approaches. Specifically, our method provides a distribution\nover the labels, which is a linear function of the model parameters. As a\nconsequence, differences between probabilities are linear functions, a property\nwhich most probabilistic models (e.g. log-linear) do not have.\n  Our model assumes that classes correspond to linear subspaces (rather than to\nhalf spaces). Using a relaxed projection operator, we construct a measure which\nevaluates the degree to which a given vector 'belongs' to a subspace, resulting\nin a distribution over labels. Interestingly, this view is closely related to\nsimilar concepts in quantum detection theory. The resulting models can be\ntrained either to maximize the margin or to optimize average likelihood\nmeasures. The corresponding optimization problems are semidefinite programs\nwhich can be solved efficiently.

We present a computational method\nfor testing whether a given CPT is separable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 15:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-02"}

This has proved a\naccurate and and reliable method to obtain this information. Through out resent\nyears researchers has begone to use the slightly newer Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) simulation. This differs from the ordinary MC by using the Markov Chain.\nMCMC originates from Bayesian statistics. This method has given researchers a\ncompletely new tool to learn something about physical systems. One of the\nfields where MCMC is a good new tool, is astrophysics. Today MCMC is widely\nused in simulating power spectra for asteroseismic data. Hereby providing the\nscientists with important new information of stellar interiors. From our\nresults we see that MCMC delivers a robust and reliable result with good error\nestimation. We also learn that MCMC is a power full tool which can be applied\nto a large verity of problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 06:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-02"}

The theory features a unique\nfermion mass spectrum which, although not describing nature precisely, provides\na good approximation. It also predicts the existence of five Higgs bosons with\na particular signature.\n  In this thesis I implemented the MCPM into the Monte-Carlo event generation\npackage MadGraph, allowing the simulation of any MCPM tree-level process. The\ngenerated events are in a standardised format and can be used for further\nanalysis with tools such as PYTHIA or GEANT, eventually leading to the\ncomparison with experimental data and the exclusion or discovery of the theory.\nThe implementation was successfully validated in different ways. It was then\nused for a first comparison of the MCPM signal events with the SM background\nand previous searches for new physics, hinting that the data expected at the\nLHC in the next years might provide exclusion limits or show signatures of this\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 10:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-02"}
