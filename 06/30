Our sample was drawn from eight major X-ray cluster surveys, and\nincludes 685 clusters in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 0.6 that overlap the area\ncovered by the NVSS. The radio AGN mechanical power was estimated from the\nradio luminosity of central NVSS sources, using the relation of Cavagnolo et\nal. 2010 that is based on mechanical powers determined from the enthalpies of\nX-ray cavities. We find only a weak correlation between radio luminosity and\ncluster X-ray luminosity, although the most powerful radio sources resides in\nluminous clusters. The average AGN mechanical power of 3x10^{44} erg/s exceeds\nthe X-ray luminosity of 44% of the clusters, indicating that the accumulation\nof radio-AGN energy is significant in these clusters. Integrating the AGN\nmechanical power to redshift z=2, using simple models for its evolution and\ndisregarding the hierarchical growth of clusters, we find that the AGN energy\naccumulated per particle in low luminosity X-ray clusters exceeds 1 keV per\nparticle. This result represents a conservative lower limit to the accumulated\nthermal energy. The estimate is comparable to the level of energy needed to\n\"preheat\" clusters, indicating that continual outbursts from radio-AGN are a\nsignificant source of gas energy in hot atmospheres. Assuming an average mass\nconversion efficiency of $\\eta=0.1$, our result implies that the supermassive\nblack holes that released this energy did so by accreting an average of ~10^9\nM_{sun} over time, which is comparable to the level of growth expected during\nthe quasar era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 16:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 20:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Most importantly, starburst galaxies are home\nto many H II regions, whose free-free absorption blocks low frequency radio\nwaves. These H II regions are discrete objects, but most multiwavelength models\nof starbursts assume a uniform medium of ionized gas, if they include the\nabsorption at all. I calculate the effective absorption coefficient of H II\nregions in starbursts, which is ultimately a cross section times the density of\nH II regions. The cross sections are calculated by assuming that H II regions\nare Str\\\"omgren spheres. The coefficient asymptotes to a constant value at low\nfrequencies, because H II regions partially cover the starburst, and are buried\npart way into the starburst's synchrotron emitting material. Considering\nStr\\\"omgren spheres around either OB stars or Super Star Clusters, I\ndemonstrate the method by fitting to the low frequency radio spectrum of M82. I\ndiscuss implications of the results for synchrotron spectrum shape, H II region\npressure, and free-free emission as a star-formation rate indicator.

We now see Newtonian mass as an emergent property. Most of\nthe mass of standard matter, by far, arises dynamically, from back-reaction of\nthe color gluon fields of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The equations for\nmassless particles support extra symmetries - specifically scale, chiral, and\ngauge symmetries. The consistency of the standard model relies on a high degree\nof underlying gauge and chiral symmetry, so the observed non-zero masses of\nmany elementary particles ($W$ and $Z$ bosons, quarks, and leptons) requires\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. Superconductivity is a prototype for spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking and for mass-generation, since photons acquire mass inside\nsuperconductors. A conceptually similar but more intricate form of\nall-pervasive (i.e. cosmic) superconductivity, in the context of the\nelectroweak standard model, gives us a successful, economical account of $W$\nand $Z$ boson masses. It also allows a phenomenologically successful, though\nprofligate, accommodation of quark and lepton masses. The new cosmic\nsuperconductivity, when implemented in a straightforward, minimal way, suggests\nthe existence of a remarkable new particle, the so-called Higgs particle.

However, a\nsignificant fraction (about 28%) of such CMEs producing type II bursts were not\nassociated with shocks at Earth. We examined a set of 21 type II bursts\nobserved by the Wind/WAVES experiment at decameter-hectometric (DH) wavelengths\nthat had CME sources very close to the disk center (within a central meridian\ndistance of 30 degrees), but did not have a shock at Earth. We find that the\nnear-Sun speeds of these CMEs average to ~644 km/s, only slightly higher than\nthe average speed of CMEs associated with radio-quiet shocks. However, the\nfraction of halo CMEs is only ~30%, compared to 54% for the radio-quiet shocks\nand 91% for all radio-loud shocks. We conclude that the disk-center radio-loud\nCMEs with no shocks at 1 AU are generally of lower energy and they drive shocks\nonly close to the Sun and dissipate before arriving at Earth. There is also\nevidence for other possible processes that lead to the lack of shock at 1 AU:\n(i) overtaking CME shocks merge and one observes a single shock at Earth, and\n(ii) deflection by nearby coronal holes can push the shocks away from the\nSun-Earth line, such that Earth misses these shocks. The probability of\nobserving a shock at 1 AU increases rapidly above 60% when the CME speed\nexceeds 1000 km/s and when the type II bursts propagate to frequencies below 1\nMHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 21:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Each sensor can utilize its available power\nfor both collaboration with other nodes and transmission to the FC. Two kinds\nof constraints, namely the cumulative and individual power constraints are\nconsidered. The effects due to imperfect information about observation and\nchannel gains are also investigated. The resulting performance improvement is\nillustrated analytically through the example of a homogeneous network with\nequicorrelated parameters. Assuming random geometric graph topology for\ncollaboration, numerical results demonstrate a significant reduction in\ndistortion even for a moderately connected network, particularly in the low\nlocal-SNR regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 23:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

For\ndecades, key decision makers in the public and private sectors have considered\ncost-effectiveness in healthcare a top priority. Their actions have focused on\nputting a limit on fees, services, or care options. However, they have met with\nlimited success as costs have increased rapidly while the quality isn't\ncommensurate with the high costs. A new approach is needed. Here we provide\neight scientifically-based steps for improving the healthcare system. The core\nof the approach is promoting the best use of resources by matching the people\nand organization to the tasks they are good at, and providing the right\nincentive structure. Harnessing costs need not mean sacrificing quality.\nQuality service and low costs can be achieved by making sure the right people\nand the right organizations deliver services. As an example, the frequent use\nof emergency rooms for non-emergency care demonstrates the waste of resources\nof highly capable individuals and facilities resulting in high costs and\nineffective care. Neither free markets nor managed care guarantees the best use\nof resources. A different oversight system is needed to promote the right\nincentives. Unlike managed care, effective oversight must not interfere with\nthe performance of care. Otherwise, cost control only makes care more\ncumbersome. The eight steps we propose are designed to dramatically improve the\neffectiveness of the healthcare system, both for those who receive services and\nthose who provide them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 23:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

We introduce a new semantics,\ncalled persistently evolutionary semantics, for predicate logic that the\nmeaning of function and predicate symbols are not already predetermined, and\npredicate and function symbols find their meaning through the interaction of\nthe subject with the language. In (classic) model theory, the mathematician who\nstudies a structure is assumed as a god who lives out of the structure, and the\nstudy of the mathematician does not effect the structure. The meaning of\npredicate and function symbols are assumed to be independent of the\nmathematician who does math. The persistently evolutionary semantics could be\nregarded as a start of \"Interactive Model Theory\" as a new paradigm in model\ntheory (similar to the paradigm of interactive computation). In interactive\nmodel theory, we suppose that a mathematical structure should consist of two\nparts: 1) an intelligent agent (a subject), and 2) an environment (language),\nand every things should find its meaning through the interaction of these two\nparts. We introduce persistently evolutionary Kripke structure for\npropositional and predicate logic. Also, we propose a persistently evolutionary\nKripke semantics for the notion of computation, where the intension of a code\nof a Turing machine persistently evolve. We show that in this Kripke model the\nsubject can never know P = NP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2012 06:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

For the Milky Way, we found that the ratio between the past\nand current star formation rates is about 2-3, averaged over the disc, but it\nvaries substantially with radius. In the other disc galaxies there is a clear\ndependency of this ratio with galaxy stellar mass and Hubble type, with more\nconstant star formation histories for small galaxies of later type.

Fingers appear sequentially and propagate within the bulk of\nthe material as soon as a critical strain, independent of the elastic modulus,\nis exceeded. Their width depends non-linearly on the distance between the\nconfining glass plates. A key element in the driving force of the instability\nis the adhesion of layers of gels to the plates, which results in a\nconsiderable expense of elastic energy during the growth of the air bubble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2012 15:28:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2013 14:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}
