However, given the relatively low significance and\nastrometric accuracy of the radio detection, and the non-simultaneity of the\nX-ray and radio measurements, this identification required further\nconfirmation. Here we present deep, high angular resolution, strictly\nsimultaneous X-ray and radio observations of G1.

Our favored explanation for the previous radio detection is\nflaring activity from a black hole low mass X-ray binary (LMXB). We performed a\nnew regression of the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, valid for\ndetermining black hole mass from radio and X-ray observations of sub-Eddington\nblack holes, finding log M_{BH} = (1.638 +/- 0.070)log L_R - (1.136 +/-\n0.077)log L_X - (6.863 +/- 0.790), with an empirically-determined uncertainty\nof 0.44 dex.

We derive individual masses of 1.484\n-0.014/+0.016 x 10^19 kg for the primary (corresponding to a density of 1.29\n+/- 0.39 g cm^-3), 7.33 -2.3/+4.7 x 10^14 kg for the inner satellite, and 9.32\n-8.3/+20.7 x 10^14 kg for the outer satellite. The oblateness of the primary\ninduces substantial precession and the J_2 value can be constrained to the\nrange of 0.0985-0.1. The orbits of the satellites are relatively circular with\neccentricities less than 0.04. The spin axis of the primary body and the\norbital poles of both satellites are all aligned within about two degrees of\neach other, indicating a nearly coplanar configuration and suggestive of\nsatellite formation in or near the equatorial plane of the primary. We also\ninvestigate the past orbital evolution of the system by simulating the effects\nof a recent passage through 3:1 mean-motion eccentricity-type resonances. In\nsome scenarios this allow us to place constraints on interior structure and\npast eccentricities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 18:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This work follows and expands on earlier\n1-D studies of spherical clusters of main-sequence stars. The 2-D approach\nallows for the study of rotating systems, as would be expected due to\ncosmological tidal torquing; other physical effects included are collisional\nmergers of stars and a bulk stellar bar perturbation in the gravitational\npotential. The 3 Myr main-sequence lifetime for large stars provides an upper\nlimit on simulation times. Two general classes of initial systems are studied:\nPlummer spheres, which represent stellar clusters, and \\gamma=0 spheres, which\nmodel galactic spheroids.\n  At the initial densities of the modeled systems, mass segregation and runaway\nstellar collisions alone are insufficient to induce core collapse within the\nlifetime limit if no bar perturbation is included. However, core collapse is\nnot a requirement for the formation of a massive object: the choice of stellar\ninitial mass function is found to play a crucial role. When using an IMF\nsimilar to that observed for dense stellar clusters the simulations show that\nthe stellar system forms massive (250M_\\odot) objects by collisional mergers;\nin almost all such cases the presence of a stellar bar allows for sufficient\nadditional outward transport of angular momentum that a core-collapse state is\nreached with corresponding further increase in the rate of formation of massive\nobjects.

The systematic enhancement of turbulent velocities may be\ndue to the combined effects of increased star formation activity, larger\ndensities, and higher pressures relative to the local ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Accounting for these terms in galaxy clustering is the first step\ntoward tests of general relativity on horizon scales. The effects can be\nclassified as two terms that represent the velocity and the gravitational\npotential contributions. Their amplitude is determined by effects such as the\nvolume and luminosity distance fluctuation effects and the time evolution of\ngalaxy number density and Hubble parameter. We compare the Newtonian\napproximation often used in the redshift-space distortion literature to the\nfully general relativistic equation, and show that Newtonian approximation\naccounts for most of the terms contributing to velocity effect. We perform a\nFisher matrix analysis of detectability of these terms and show that in a\nsingle tracer survey they are completely undetectable.

As long\nas the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a curved surface is proportional to one of\nthe Casimir invariants of the isometry algebra, free motion on the surface is\ndescribed by means of the eigenvalue problem of that very Casimir operator and\nthe excitation modes are classified according to the irreps of the algebra of\ninterest. In consequence, also the spectra of the equivalent Schroedinger\noperators are classified according to the same irreps. We here use the\npotential algebra concept as a guidance in the search for an interaction\ndescribing conformal degeneracies. For this purpose we subject the so(4)\nisometry algebra of the S^3 ball to a particular non-unitary similarity\ntransformation and obtain a deformed isometry copy to S^3 such that free motion\non the copy is equivalent to a cotangent perturbed motion on S^3, and to the 1D\nSchroedinger operator with the trigonometric Rosen-Morse potential as well.

We observe novel behavior. a) When the current density is less\nthan the Goldreich-Julian (GJ) value (0<j/j_{GJ}<1), space charge limited\nacceleration of the current carrying beam is mild, with the full GJ charge\ndensity being comprised of the charge density of the beam, co-existing with a\ncloud of electrically trapped particles with the same sign of charge as the\nbeam.

In turn,\nPop III star formation and early metal enrichment are slowed by the high energy\nradiation emitted by Pop II stars. Thus, through the SNe and radiation they\nproduce, Populations II and III coevolve in the early Universe, one regulated\nby the other. We present large (4 Mpc)^3, high resolution cosmological\nsimulations in which we self-consistently model early metal enrichment and the\nstellar radiation responsible for the destruction of the coolants (H2 and HD)\nrequired for Pop III star formation. We find that the molecule-dissociating\nstellar radiation produced both locally and over cosmological distances reduces\nthe Pop III star formation rate at z > 10 by up to an order of magnitude\ncompared to the case in which this radiation is not included. However, we find\nthat the effect of LW feedback is to enhance the amount of Pop II star\nformation. We attribute this to the reduced rate at which gas is blown out of\ndark matter haloes by SNe in the simulation with LW feedback, which results in\nlarger reservoirs for metal-enriched star formation. Even accounting for metal\nenrichment, molecule-dissociating radiation and the strong suppression of\nlow-mass galaxy formation due to reionization at z < 10, we find that Pop III\nstars are still formed at a rate of ~ 10^-5 M_sun yr^-1 Mpc^-3 down to z ~ 6.\nThis suggests that the majority of primordial pair-instability SNe that may be\nuncovered in future surveys will be found at z < 10.

Afterwards, the Israel's\njunction conditions are computed, allowing the attainment of an effective\nLagrangian in the visible brane. In particular, for a (4+1)-dimensional\nHorava-like model defined in the bulk without cosmological constant, we show\nthat the resultant effective Lagrangian in the brane corresponds to a\n(3+1)-dimensional Horava-like model with an emergent positive cosmological\nconstant but without detailed balance condition.

A current\nconsensus is that the stronger the SOC, the smaller is the critical interaction\nUc required for a spin-orbit Mott insulator, because the atomic SOC splits a\nband into different total angular momentum bands narrowing the effective\nbandwidth. It was further claimed that at large enough SOC, the stronger the\nSOC, the weaker the Uc because in general the effective SOC is enhanced with\nincreasing electron-electron interaction strength. Contrary to this\nexpectation, we find that, in orthorhombic perovskite oxides (Pbnm), the\nstronger the SOC, the bigger the Uc. This is originated from a line of Dirac\nnode in Jeff=1/2 bands near the Fermi level inherited from a combination of the\nlattice structure and a large SOC.

Using hydrodynamical\nsimulations of the formation of a massive M_vir=5 10^11 M_sun halo by z=6 (the\nmost massive progenitor of a cluster of M_vir=2 10^15 M_sun at z=0), we\nevaluate the impact of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on galaxy mass content, BH\nself-regulation, and gas distribution inside this massive halo. We find that SN\nfeedback has a marginal influence on the stellar structure, and no influence on\nthe mass distribution on large scales. In contrast, AGN feedback alone is able\nto significantly alter the stellar-bulge mass content by quenching star\nformation when the BH is self-regulating, and by depleting the cold gas\nreservoir in the centre of the galaxy. The growth of the BH proceeds first by a\nrapid Eddington-limited period fed by direct cold filamentary infall. When the\nenergy delivered by the AGN is sufficiently large to unbind the cold gas of the\nbulge, the accretion of gas onto the BH is maintained both by smooth gas inflow\nand clump migration through the galactic disc triggered by merger-induced\ntorques. The feedback from the AGN has also a severe consequence on the baryon\nmass content within the halo, producing large-scale hot superwinds, able to\nblow away some of the cold filamentary material from the centre and reduce the\nbaryon fraction by more than 30 per cent within the halo's virial radius.

After subtraction of the model, the residuals\nshowed an approximate linear upward trend after 1942. Herein we assume that the\nresidual upward warming observed during the second half of the 20th century has\nbeen mostly induced by a worldwide rapid increase of anthropogenic emissions,\nurbanization and land use change. The warming observed before 1942 is\nrelatively small and it is assumed to have been mostly naturally induced by a\nclimatic recovery since the Little Ice Age of the 17th century and the Dalton\nMinimum at the beginning of the 19th century.

New solar activity proxy models are developed that suggest a mechanism\nfor both the 60-year climate cycle and a portion of the long-term warming\ntrend.

To investigate this, we study a simplified model, the collapse of a\nperfectly cold Plummer sphere. First, we examine an N-body simulation of this\nmodel with particles constrained to purely radial orbits. This results in a\nfinal state characterized by a profile slightly steeper than \\rho \\propto\nr^{-2} at small radii and behaving as \\rho \\propto r^{-4} at large radii, which\ncan be understood in terms of simple analytic arguments. Next, we repeat our\nsimulation without the restriction of radial orbits. This results in a\nshallower inner density profile, like those found in elliptical galaxies and\nCDM halos. We attribute this change to the radial orbit instability (ROI) and\npropose a form of the distribution function (DF) motivated by a physical\npicture of collapse. As evidence of the link between our model and CDM halos,\nwe find that our collapse simulation has a final state with pseudo-phase-space\ndensity which scales roughly as \\rho/\\sigma^3 \\propto r^{-1.875}, like that\nobserved in CDM halos from cosmological simulations (Navarro et al. 2010). The\nvelocity anisotropy profile is also qualitatively similar to that found near\nthe centers of these halos. We argue that the discrepancy at large radii (where\nCDM halos scale as \\rho \\propto r^{-3}) is due to the presence of the\ncosmological background or continued infall. This leads us to predict that the\nouter CDM halo density profile is not \"universal,\" but instead depends on\ncosmological environment (be it an underdense void or overdense region).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 22:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-27"}

These and other\nquestions are addressed, based on a qualitative analysis of publicly available\nvideos and materials, which document the planning and organization of the Love\nParade in Duisburg, Germany, and the crowd disaster on July 24, 2010. Our\nanalysis reveals a number of misunderstandings that have widely spread.

The focus of our analysis is on the\ncontributing causal factors and their mutual interdependencies, not on legal\nissues or the judgment of personal or institutional responsibilities. Video\nrecordings show that, in Duisburg, people stumbled and piled up due to a\n'domino effect', resulting from a phenomenon called 'crowd turbulence' or\n'crowd quake'. Crowd quakes are a typical reason for crowd disasters, to be\ndistinguished from crowd disasters resulting from 'panic stampedes' or 'crowd\ncrushes'. In Duisburg, crowd turbulence was the consequence of amplifying\nfeedback and cascading effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities.\nAccordingly, things can go terribly wrong in spite of no bad intentions from\nanyone. Comparing the incident in Duisburg with others, we give recommendations\nto help prevent future crowd disasters. In particular, we introduce a new scale\nto assess the criticality of conditions in the crowd. This may allow\npreventative measures to be taken earlier on.

For a\ngiven mass, many planets have inflated radii, while others are surprisingly\ncompact and may harbor large central cores. Motivated by the observational\nsample, this paper considers possible effects from collisions of smaller rocky\nplanets with gas giant planets. In this scenario, the Jovian planets migrate\nfirst and enter into (approximately) 4 day orbits, whereas rocky planets (mass\n= 0.1-20 that of Earth) migrate later and then encounter the gaseous giants.\nPrevious work indicates that the collision rates are high for such systems.\nThis paper calculates the trajectories of incoming rocky planets as they orbit\nwithin the gaseous planets and are subjected to gravitational, frictional, and\ntidal forces. These collisions always increase the metallicity of the Jovian\nplanets. If the incoming rocky bodies survive tidal destruction and reach the\ncentral regions, they provide a means of producing large planetary cores. Both\nthe added metallicity and larger cores act to decrease the radii of the gas\ngiants at fixed mass. The energy released during these collisions provides the\nJovian planet with an additional heat source; here we determine the radial\nlayers where kinetic energy of the colliding body is dissipated, including the\nenergy remaining upon impact with the existing core. This process could have\nlong-term effects if the colliding body deposits significant energy deep in the\ninterior, in regions of high opacity. Both Hot Jupiters and newly formed gas\ngiants have inflated radii, large enough to allow incoming rocky planets to\nsurvive tidal disruption, enhance the central core mass, and deposit\nsignificant energy (in contrast, denser giant planets with the mass and radius\nof Jupiter are expected to tidally destroy incoming rocky bodies).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 23:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Our estimates are sharp when both covariance functions have finite\n1-variation, which includes a large class of Gaussian processes.\n  Two applications of our estimates are discussed. The first one gives the a.s.\nconvergence rates for approximated solutions to rough differential equations\ndriven by Gaussian processes. In the second example, we show how to recover the\noptimal time regularity for solutions of some rough SPDEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 00:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 14:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-03"}

The probability distribution of such a system, the\nBoltzmann distribution, is derived from the uniform probability distribution of\nthe closed universe consisting of the open system and the heat bath, by taking\nthe limit where the heat bath is much larger than the system of interest.\nAlternatively, the Boltzmann distribution can be derived from the Maximum\nEntropy Principle, where the Gibbs-Shannon entropy is maximized under the\nconstraint that the mean energy of the open system is fixed. To make the\nconnection between these two apparently distinct methods for deriving the\nBoltzmann distribution, it is first shown that the uniform distribution for a\nmicrocanonical distribution is obtained from the Maximum Entropy Principle\napplied to a closed system. Then I show that the target function in the Maximum\nEntropy Principle for the open system, is obtained by partial maximization of\nGibbs-Shannon entropy of the closed universe over the microstate probability\ndistributions of the heat bath. Thus, microcanonical origin of the Entropy\nMaximization procedure for an open system, is established in a rigorous manner,\nshowing the equivalence between apparently two distinct approaches for deriving\nthe Boltzmann distribution. By extending the mathematical formalism to\ndynamical paths, the result may also provide an alternative justification for\nthe principle of path entropy maximization as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 06:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We introduce a theory for the interaction between the stellar\nand planetary fields focussing on the processes that release magnetic energy in\nthe stellar coronae. We consider the energy dissipated by the reconnection\nbetween the stellar and planetary magnetic fields as well as that made\navailable by the modulation of the magnetic helicity of the coronal field\nproduced by the orbital motion of the planet. We estimate the powers released\nby both processes in the case of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric, linear and\nnon-linear force-free coronal fields finding that they scale as v_r (B_s)^(4/3)\n(B_p)^(2/3) (R_p)^2, where v_r is the relative velocity between the stellar and\nplanetary fields, B_s the mean stellar surface field, B_p the planetary field\nat the poles, and R_p the radius of the planet.

Given the\nrelational and inaccurate external classifier information, we consider two\ngraph based settings in which the problem of collective classification can be\nsolved. In the first setting the class distribution is used to fix labels to a\nsubset of nodes and the labels for the remaining nodes are obtained like in a\ntransductive setting.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The\nnumerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a\nlong lifetime ($\\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \\lesssim\n3.0M_{\\odot}$. By contrast, the formed HMNS collapses to a BH in a shorter time\nscale with the hyperonic EOS for $M \\gtrsim 2.7M_{\\odot}$.

Similarly, an AND-cross-composition for Q rules out polynomial\nkernels for Q under Bodlaender et al.'s AND-distillation conjecture.\n  Our technique generalizes and strengthens the recent techniques of using\ncomposition algorithms and of transferring the lower bounds via polynomial\nparameter transformations.

The amplitude of\nthe scalar perturbations is decreased as compared with a pure RS2 model. In\naddition, the effect from the Gauss-Bonnet correction in an induced gravity\nbrane-world model is to decrease the amplitude of the scalar perturbations, and\na similar result is obtained for the induced gravity effect in a Gauss-Bonnet\nbrane-world. In general, in the high energy limit the amplitude is highly\nsuppressed by the Gauss-Bonnet effect. Finally, we constrain the model using\nthe latest WMAP7 data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 10:19:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 13:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

If one represents these fields in terms of partons (quarks and gluons),\nthe average number densities of the latter saturate at ultrahigh energies. At\nthat point, nonlinear effects become predominant in the dynamical equations.\nThe hadronic states that one gets in this regime of QCD are generically called\n\"color glass condensates\".\n  Our understanding of scattering in QCD has benefited from recent progress in\nstatistical and mathematical physics. The evolution of hadronic scattering\namplitudes at fixed impact parameter in the regime where nonlinear parton\nsaturation effects become sizable was shown to be similar to the time evolution\nof a system of classical particles undergoing reaction-diffusion processes. The\ndynamics of such a system is essentially governed by equations in the\nuniversality class of the stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov\nequation, which is a stochastic nonlinear partial differential equation.\nRealizations of that kind of equations (that is, \"events\" in a particle physics\nlanguage) have the form of noisy traveling waves.

The FUV is dominantly radiated from\nnewly formed short-lived OB stars, while the FIR is emitted by dust grains\nheated by the FUV radiation field. It is known that dust is always associated\nwith star formation activity. Thus, both FUV and FIR are tightly related to the\nstar formation in galaxies, but in a very complicated manner.

The\n\\textit{replacement path problem} asks to find for a given graph $G = (V,E)$,\ntwo designated vertices $s,t\\in V$ and a shortest $s$-$t$ path $P$ in $G$, a\n\\textit{replacement path} $P_e$ for every edge $e$ on the path $P$. The\nreplacement path $P_e$ is simply a shortest $s$-$t$ path in the graph, which\navoids the \\textit{failed} edge $e$. We adapt this problem to deal with the\nnatural scenario, that the edge which failed is not known at the time of\nsolution implementation. Instead, our problem assumes that the identity of the\nfailed edge only becomes available when the routing mechanism tries to cross\nthe edge. This situation is motivated by applications in distributed networks,\nwhere information about recent changes in the network is only stored locally,\nand fault-tolerant optimization, where an adversary tries to delay the\ndiscovery of the materialized scenario as much as possible. Consequently, we\ndefine the \\textit{online replacement path problem}, which asks to find a\nnominal $s$-$t$ path $Q$ and detours $Q_e$ for every edge on the path $Q$, such\nthat the worst-case arrival time at the destination is minimized. Our main\ncontribution is a label setting algorithm, which solves the problem in\nundirected graphs in time $O(m \\log n)$ and linear space for all sources and a\nsingle destination. We also present algorithms for extensions of the model to\nany bounded number of failed edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 11:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-27"}

Identities relating various partial amplitudes have\nbeen known since the 80's. They are Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) identities. In 2008,\nBern, Carrasco and Johansson (BCJ) introduced a new set of identities which\nreduce the number of independent partial amplitudes to (n-3)!. In recent years,\nseveral formulations for partial amplitudes have been discovered and shown to\nbe equivalent to each other. These can be thought of as simple dualities in the\nsense that different formulations make manifest different properties of the\nsame object; the amplitude. One such formulation is the ACCK Grassmannian\nformulation which makes Yangian invariance of individual partial amplitudes\nmanifest. A different formulation is the so-called connected formula introduced\nby Witten in twistor space and formulated in momentum space by Roiban, Spradlin\nand Volovich. It has been argued that the connected formula is ideal for\nstudying properties which are related to the full amplitude, such as the KK\nrelations, and not to particular partial amplitudes, like Yangian invariance.\nFollowing this logic, it is very natural to expect that the BCJ identities\nshould have a very simple proof in the connected formulation.

Variability has been\ndetected in the flux emitted by the central star with a period of 639 \\pm 4\ndays, in good agreement with determinations in the literature. Variability is\nalso detected in the bow shock around CW Leo that had previously been detected\nin the ultraviolet and Herschel PACS/SPIRE data. Although difficult to prove\ndirectly, our working hypothesis is that this variability is directly related\nto that of the central star. In this case, fitting a sine curve with the period\nfixed to 639 days results in a time-lag in the variability between bow shock\nand the central star of 402 \\pm 37 days. The orientation of the bow shock\nrelative to the plane of the sky is unknown (but see below). For an inclination\nangle of zero degrees, the observed time-lag translates into a distance to CW\nLeo of 130 \\pm 13 pc, and for non-zero inclination angles the distance is\nsmaller. Fitting the shape of the bow shock with an analytical model (Wilkin\n1996), the effect of the inclination angle on the distance may be estimated.\nMaking the additional assumption that the relative peculiar velocity between\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) and CW Leo is determined entirely by the star\nspace velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (i.e. a stationary\nISM), the inclination angle is found to be (-33.3 \\pm 0.8) degrees based on the\nobserved proper motion and radial velocity. Using the Wilkin model, our current\nbest estimate of the distance to CW Leo is 123 \\pm 14 pc. For a distance of 123\npc, we derive a mean luminosity of 7790 \\pm 150 Lsol (internal error).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 13:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Previous approaches to this Quantized Compressed Sensing (QCS)\nproblem based on Gaussian models (bounded l2-norm) for the quantization\ndistortion yield results that, while often acceptable, may not be fully\nconsistent: re-measurement and quantization of the reconstructed signal do not\nnecessarily match the initial observations. Quantization distortion instead\nmore closely resembles heteroscedastic uniform noise, with variance depending\non the observed quantization bin. Generalizing our previous work on uniform\nquantization, we show that for nonuniform quantizers described by the\n\"compander\" formalism, quantization distortion may be better characterized as\nhaving bounded weighted lp-norm (p >= 2), for a particular weighting. We\ndevelop a new reconstruction approach, termed Generalized Basis Pursuit DeNoise\n(GBPDN), which minimizes the sparsity of the reconstructed signal under this\nweighted lp-norm fidelity constraint. We prove that for B bits per measurement\nand under the oversampled QCS scenario (when the number of measurements is\nlarge compared to the signal sparsity) if the sensing matrix satisfies a\nproposed generalized Restricted Isometry Property, then, GBPDN provides a\nreconstruction error of sparse signals which decreases like\nO(2^{-B}/\\sqrt{p+1}): a reduction by a factor \\sqrt{p+1} relative to that\nproduced by using the l2-norm. Besides the QCS scenario, we also show that\nGBPDN applies straightforwardly to the related case of CS measurements\ncorrupted by heteroscedastic Generalized Gaussian noise with provable\nreconstruction error reduction.

If a finite amount of heat is supplied, the stresses gradually\ndisappear as temperature becomes homogeneous throughout the sphere. We show\nthat before this happens, there is a temporary lowering of pressure and density\nin the interior of the sphere, inducing a transient lowering of the temperature\nhere. For ordinary solids this effect is small because c_p is almost equal to\nc_V. For fluent liquids the effect is negligible because their dynamic shear\nmodulus vanishes. For a liquid at its glass transition, however, the effect is\ngenerally considerably larger than in solids. This paper presents analytical\nsolutions of the relevant coupled thermoviscoelastic equations. In general,\nthere is a difference between the isobaric specific heat, c_p, measured at\nconstant isotropic pressure and the longitudinal specific heat, c_l, pertaining\nto mechanical boundary conditions that confine the associated expansion to be\nlongitudinal. In the exact treatment of heat propagation the heat diffusion\nconstant contains c_l rather than c_p. We show that the key parameter\ncontrolling the magnitude of the \"cooling-by-heating\" effect is the relative\ndifference between these two specific heats. For a typical glass-forming\nliquid, when temperature at the surface is increased by 1 K, a lowering of the\ntemperature in the sphere center of order 5 mK is expected if the experiment is\nperformed at the glass transition. The cooling-by-heating effect is confirmed\nby measurements on a 19 mm diameter glucose sphere at the glass transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 14:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

Among them,\nSwiss-cheeses where the inhomogeneous patches are modeled by different\nparticular Szekeres solutions have been used for reproducing the apparent\ndimming of the type Ia supernovae (SNIa).

Hence, the Bondi accretion cannot be used in\nthese cases, such as in the galaxy NGC 3115. The winds of these high-velocity\nstars are shocked to temperatures above the virial temperature of the galaxy,\nleading to the formation of a hot bubble of size ~0.1-10 pc near the center.\nThis hot bubble can substantially reduce the mass accretion rate by the SMBH.\nIf the density of the hot bubble is lower than that of the interstellar medium\n(ISM), a density-inversion layer is formed. As the gas loses energy by X-ray\nradiation, eventually more mass of the cooling shocked stellar winds will be\naccreted to the SMBH. This accretion will be of cold clumps. After a period of\nmillions of years of low AGN activity, therefore, a stronger AGN activity will\noccur that will heat and expel gas, much as in cooling flow clusters. Adding to\nother problems of the Bondi process, our results render the Bondi accretion\nirrelevant for AGN feedback in cooling flow in galaxies and small groups of\ngalaxies and during galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 15:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 07:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
