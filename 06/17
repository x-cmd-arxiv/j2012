We develop two methods for constructing the symplectic groupoids\nof log symplectic manifolds.

The second is a gluing construction, whereby groupoids defined on\nthe open sets of an appropriate cover may be combined to obtain global\nintegrations.\n  This allows us to classify all Hausdorff symplectic groupoids of log\nsymplectic manifolds in a combinatorial fashion, in terms of a certain graph of\nfundamental groups associated to the manifold. Using the same ideas, and as a\nfirst step, we also construct and classify the groupoids integrating the Lie\nalgebroid of vector fields tangent to a smooth hypersurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 16:24:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 01:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Persistent increased activity of the enzyme\nprotein kinase M (PKM) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Additional\nspatial and temporal features that govern LTP and LTD induction are embodied in\nthe synaptic tagging and capture (STC) and cross capture hypotheses. Only\nsynapses that have been \"tagged\" by an stimulus sufficient for LTP and learning\ncan \"capture\" PKM. A model was developed to simulate the dynamics of key\nmolecules required for LTP and LTD. The model concisely represents\nrelationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. The model\nsuccessfully simulated LTP maintained by persistent synaptic PKM, STC, LTD, and\ncross capture, and makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKM.\nThe maintenance of LTP, and consequently of at least some forms of long-term\nmemory, is predicted to require continual positive feedback in which PKM\nenhances its own synthesis only at potentiated synapses. This feedback\nunderlies bistability in the activity of PKM. Second, cross capture requires\nthe induction of LTD to induce dendritic PKM synthesis, although this may\nrequire tagging of a nearby synapse for LTP. The model also simulates the\neffects of PKM inhibition, and makes additional predictions for the dynamics of\nCaM kinases. Experiments testing the above predictions would significantly\nadvance the understanding of memory maintenance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 19:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 23:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 20:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Namely, the clients wish to oursource\ncomputation to the cloud together with their private data stored in the cloud,\nwhich naturally happens when the computation is involved with large datasets,\ne.g., to analyze malicious URLs. We note that the \\MCC\\ problem is different\nfrom widely considered concepts, e.g., secure multiparty computation and\nmultiparty computation with server aid.\n  To address this problem, we introduce the notion of \\emph{homomorphic\nthreshold proxy re-encryption} schemes, which are encryption schemes that enjoy\nthree promising properties: proxy re-encryption -- transforming encrypted data\nof one user to encrypted data of target user, threshold decryption --\ndecrypting encrypted data by combining secret key shares obtained by a set of\nusers, and homomorphic computation -- evaluating functions on the encrypted\ndata.

All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their\nforward channel gains; however, they have perfect information about their\nbackward channel gains. The focus of this paper is on simple, efficient, and\npractical relaying schemes to increase the expected-rate at the destination.\nFor this purpose, various combinations of relaying protocols and the broadcast\napproach (multi-layer coding) are proposed. For the decode-forward (DF)\nrelaying, the maximum finite-layer expected-rate as well as two upper-bounds on\nthe continuous-layer expected-rate are obtained. The main feature of the\nproposed DF scheme is that the layers being decoded at both relays are added\ncoherently at the destination although each relay has no information about the\nnumber of layers being successfully decoded by the other relay. It is proved\nthat the optimal coding scheme is transmitting uncorrelated signals via the\nrelays. Next, the maximum expected-rate of ON/OFF based amplify-forward (AF)\nrelaying is analytically derived. For further performance improvement, a hybrid\ndecode-amplify-forward (DAF) relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach\nat the source and relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput and maximum\nfinite-layer expected-rate are presented. Moreover, the maximum throughput and\nmaximum expected-rate in the compress-forward (CF) relaying adopting the\nbroadcast approach, using optimal quantizers and Wyner-Ziv compression at the\nrelays, are fully derived. All theoretical results are illustrated by numerical\nsimulations. As it turns out from the results, when the ratio of the relay\npower to the source power is high, the CF relaying outperforms DAF (and hence\noutperforms both DF and AF relaying); otherwise, DAF scheme is superior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2012 03:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-19"}

We have also compared the U and B bands with the analysis\nresults. This comparison allowed us to evaluate the methods used in the\nanalyses. The analyses provided the following results.

During\nevaporation, the interface between the two phases develops a fingering\ninstability similar to that observed in the Saffman-Taylor problem. The\ndynamics of the droplet interface is dictated by an infinite number of\nconserved quantities: all harmonic moments decay exponentially at the same\nrate. A typical scenario is the nucleation of a dry patch within the droplet\ndomain. We construct solutions of this problem and analyze the toplogical\ntransition occuring when the boundary of the dry patch meets the outer\nboundary. We show a duality between Laplacian growth and evaporation, and\nutilize it to explain the behaviour near the transition. We construct a family\nof problems for which evaporation and Laplacian growth are limiting cases and\nshow that a necessary condition for a smooth topological transition, in this\nfamily, is that all boundaries share the same pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2012 15:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 11:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-17"}
