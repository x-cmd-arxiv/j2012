The standard picture of a type IIP supernova\nhas the blastwave interacting with the progenitor's circumstellar matter to\nproduce a hot region bounded by a forward and a reverse shock. This region is\nthought to be responsible for most of the X-ray and radio emission from these\nobjects. Yet the origin of X-rays from these supernovae is not well understood\nquantitatively. The relative contributions of particle acceleration and\nmagnetic field amplification in generating the X-ray and radio emission need to\nbe determined. In this work we analyze archival Chandra observations of SN\n2004dj, the nearest supernova since SN 1987A, along with published radio and\noptical information. We determine the pre-explosion mass loss rate, blastwave\nvelocity, electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification efficiencies.\nWe find that a greater fraction of the thermal energy goes into accelerating\nelectrons than into amplifying magnetic fields. We conclude that the X-ray\nemission arises out of a combination of inverse Compton scattering by\nnon-thermal electrons accelerated in the forward shock and thermal emission\nfrom supernova ejecta heated by the reverse shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 19:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-06"}

The fraction of close pairs is three times higher in the top density\nquartile than in the lowest one. This environmental variation in pair fractions\nwill translate into merger fractions since merger timescales are shown, based\non Millennium simulation catalogs, to be largely independent of environment.\nWhile galactic properties of close kinematic pairs (morphologies and star\nformation rates) may seem to be non-representative of an underlying galaxy\npopulation, they can be explained by taking into account well-known effects of\nenvironment, and changes caused by interactions. The latter is responsible for\nan increase of irregular galaxies in pairs by a factor of 50-75%, with a\ndisproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs (4-8\ntimes), due to disturbance of about 15% of the disk galaxies in pairs. Another\nsign of interaction is an observed boost in specific star formation rate\n(factor 2-4) for the closest pairs. While significant for paired galaxies, this\ntriggered star-formation due to interactions represents only about 5% of the\nintegrated star-formation activity in our volume-limited sample. Although\nmajority of close kinematic pairs are in dense environments, the effects of\ninteractions appear to be strongest in the lower density environments.

To measure the first estimation of the giant exoplanetary systems\nfrequency at large orbital separation around A-stars, we have conducted a\ndeep-imaging survey of young (8-400 Myr), nearby (19-84 pc) A- and F-stars to\nsearch for substellar companions in the 10-300 AU range. The sample of 42 stars\ncombines all A-stars observed in previous AO planet search surveys reported in\nthe literature with new AO observations from VLT/NaCo and Gemini/NIRI. It\nrepresents an initial subset of the International Deep Planet Survey (IDPS)\nsample of stars covering M- to B-stars. The data were obtained with\ndiffraction-limited observations in H- and Ks-band combined with angular\ndifferential imaging to suppress the speckle noise of the central stars,\nresulting in typical 5-sigma detection limits in magnitude difference of 12 mag\nat 1\", 14 mag at 2\" and 16 mag at 5\" which is sufficient to detect massive\nplanets. A detailed statistical analysis of the survey results is performed\nusing Monte Carlo simulations. Considering the planet detections, we estimate\nthe fraction of A-stars having at least one massive planet (3-14 MJup) in the\nrange 5-320 AU to be inside 5.9-18.8% at 68% confidence, assuming a flat\ndistribution for the mass of the planets. By comparison, the brown dwarf (15-75\nMJup) frequency for the sample is 2.0-8.9% at 68% confidence in the range 5-320\nAU. Assuming power law distributions for the mass and semimajor axis of the\nplanet population, the AO data are consistent with a declining number of\nmassive planets with increasing orbital radius which is distinct from the\nrising slope inferred from radial velocity (RV) surveys around evolved A-stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This raises the\nquestion of whether there are interesting deca-TeV models for which the LHC may\nfind direct clues. A possible scenario for such physics is a 5D warped model of\nfermion masses and mixing, with Kaluza-Klein masses m_KK ~ 10 TeV, allowing it\nto avoid tension with stringent constraints, especially from flavor data.\nDiscovery of a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson, for which there are some hints\nat ~125 GeV at the LHC, would also require the KK masses to be at or above 10\nTeV. These warped models generically predict the appearance of a much lighter\nradion scalar. We find that, in viable warped models of flavor, a radion with a\nmass of a few hundred GeV and an inverse coupling of order m_KK ~ 10 TeV could\ntypically be accessible to the LHC experiments -- with sqrt(s) = 14 TeV and 100\nfb^-1 of data. The above statements can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to 4D\ndual models, where conformal dynamics and a dilaton replace warping and the\nradion, respectively.

We investigate the properties of these power spectra for simulated\ngalaxies and dark matter halos and compare them to the dark matter power\nspectra, generalizing the concept of the bias. Because all of the quantities\nare number weighted this approach is well defined even for sparse systems such\nas massive halos, in contrasts to the previous approaches to RSD where velocity\ncorrelations have been explored. We find that the number density weighting\nleads to a strong scale dependence of the bias terms for momentum density\nauto-correlation and cross-correlation with density. This trend becomes more\nsignificant for the more biased halos and leads to an enhancement of RSD power\nrelative to the linear theory. Fingers-of-god effects, which in this formalism\ncome from the correlations of the higher order moments beyond the momentum\ndensity, lead to smoothing of the power spectrum and can reduce this\nenhancement of power, but are relatively small for halos with no small-scale\nvelocity dispersion. In comparison, for a more realistic galaxy sample with\nsatellites the velocity dispersion generated by satellite motions inside the\nhalos leads to a larger power suppression on small scales, but this depends on\nthe satellite fraction. We investigate several statistics such as the\ntwo-dimensional power spectrum, its multipole moments, its powers of mu^2, and\nconfiguration space statistics. Overall we find that the nonlinear effects in\nrealistic galaxy samples such as luminous red galaxies affect the redshift\nspace clustering on very large scales: for example, the quadrupole moment is\naffected by 10% for k<0.1h/mpc, which means that these effects need to be\nunderstood if we want to extract cosmological information from the redshift\nspace distortions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 20:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Particular attention is paid to the\nmaximal-entropy random walk, which serves as a very distinct alternative to the\nordinary random walk used in network analysis.\n  The various importance measures, defined both with the use of ordinary random\nwalk and the maximal-entropy random walk, are compared numerically on a set of\nbenchmark graphs. It is shown that groups of centrality measures defined with\nthe two random walks cluster into two separate families.

Thus, in this\ninstance, ill-conditioning of the linear system does not prohibit a good\napproximation.\n  In the second part of this paper we consider the issue of computing Fourier\nextensions from equispaced data. A result of Platte, Trefethen & Kuijlaars\nstates that no method for this problem can be both numerically stable and\nexponentially convergent. We explain how Fourier extensions relate to this\ntheoretical barrier, and demonstrate that they are particularly well suited for\nthis problem: namely, they obtain at least superalgebraic convergence in a\nnumerically stable manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 02:32:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 20:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 May 2013 22:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

This small dynamical range, combined with the effects of boundary\nconditions, makes the simulation results suspectable.

Two models have been proposed to explain this\nresult. In the ADIOS model, the inward decrease of accretion rate is because of\nthe loss of gas in the outflow. In the CDAF model, the gas is assumed to be\nlocked in convective eddies, which results in the inward decrease of the\naccretion rate. We investigate the nature of inward decrease of accretion rate\nusing HD and MHD simulations. We calculate various properties of inflow and\noutflow, including the mass flux, radial and rotational velocities,\ntemperature, and the Bernoulli parameter ($Be$). Systematic and significant\ndifferences between inflow and outflow are found. These results suggest that\nthe inflow and outflow are not dominated by convective turbulence, but are\nsystematic inward and outward motion. We have also analyzed the convective\nstability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are convectively stable.\nThese results indicate that the ADIOS scenario is favored. The different\nproperties of inflow and outflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing\noutflow in HD and MHD flows are buoyancy and centrifugal force associated with\nthe magnetic field, respectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the\nBlandford & Payne mechanism. We also study the effect of initial conditions in\nthe simulations. We find that the value of $Be$ is mainly determined by the\nvalue of $Be$ of the initial condition. We discuss some possible observational\napplications of our outflow model.

Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and\ndifferential geometry of second order differential equations are explained.\nThen an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the\nLorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on\nthe space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the\naveraged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams\ndescribed by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are\nsimilar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by\nthe simpler {\\it averaged Lorentz force equation}.

Tight observational limits on their\nabundance constrain the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations on very small\nscales which can not otherwise be constrained, with PBH's only forming from the\nextremely rare large fluctuations. The number of PBH's formed is therefore\nsensitive to small changes in the shape of the tail of the fluctuation\ndistribution, which itself depends on the amount of non-Gaussianity present. We\nstudy, for the first time, how quadratic and cubic local non-Gaussianity of\narbitrary size (parameterised by f_nl and g_nl respectively) affects the PBH\nabundance and the resulting constraints on the amplitude of the fluctuations on\nvery small scales. Intriguingly we find that even non-linearity parameters of\norder unity have a significant impact on the PBH abundance. The sign of the\nnon-Gaussianity is particularly important, with the constraint on the allowed\nfluctuation amplitude tightening by an order of magnitude as f_nl changes from\njust -0.5 to 0.5. We find that if PBH's are observed in the future, then\nregardless of the amplitude of the fluctuations, non-negligible negative f_nl\nwould be ruled out.

The starting point is the\ndebris created in a simulation of the Moon-forming impact. The dynamical\nevolution is followed for 10 Myr including the effects of Earth, Venus, Mars\nand Jupiter. The spatial distribution evolves from a clump in the first few\nmonths to an asymmetric ring for the first 10 kyr and finally becoming an\naxisymmetric ring by about 1 Myr after the impact. By 10 Myr after the impact\n20% of the particles have been accreted onto Earth and 17% onto Venus, with 8%\nejected by Jupiter and other bodies playing minor roles. However, the fate of\nthe debris also depends strongly on how fast it is collisionally depleted,\nwhich depends on the poorly constrained size distribution of the impact debris.\nAssuming that the debris is made up of 30% by mass mm-cm-sized vapour\ncondensates and 70% boulders up to 500 km, we find that the condensates deplete\nrapidly on ~1000 yr timescales, whereas the boulders deplete predominantly\ndynamically. By considering the luminosity of dust produced in collisions\nwithin the boulder-debris distribution we find that the Moon-forming impact\nwould have been readily detectable around other stars in Spitzer 24 micron\nsurveys for around 25 Myr after the impact, with levels of emission comparable\nto many known hot dust systems. The vapour condensates meanwhile produce a\nshort-lived, optically thick, spike of emission. We use these surveys to make\nan estimate of the fraction of stars that form terrestrial planets, F_TPF.\nSince current terrestrial planet formation models invoke multiple giant\nimpacts, the low fraction of 10-100 Myr stars found to have warm (~150 K) dust\nimplies that F_TPF ~<10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 12:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Thereby the resonance character of hadronic\nexcitations is completely ignored. A more realistic description of hadron\nspectra can be achieved by including explicit mesonic degrees of freedom, which\ncouple directly to the constituent quarks. We will present a coupled-channel\nformalism that describes such hybrid systems in a relativistically invariant\nway and allows for the decay of excited hadrons. The formalism is based on the\npoint-form of relativistic quantum mechanics. If the confining forces between\nthe (anti)quarks are described by instantaneous interactions it can be formally\nshown that the mass-eigenvalue problem for a system that consists of dynamical\n(anti)quarks and mesons reduces to a hadronic eigenvalue problem in which the\neigenstates of the pure confinement problem (bare hadrons) are coupled via\nmeson loops. The only point where the quark substructure enters are form\nfactors at the meson-(bare) hadron vertices. The physical picture that emerges\nresembles the kind of hadronic resonance model that has been developed by Sato\nand Lee and is now heavily used at the Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) to\nfix $N^\\ast$ properties. Our approach, however, is in a certain sense inverse\nto the one of Sato and Lee. Whereas they want to undress physical resonances to\nend up with bare quantities, we rather want to dress the bound-states resulting\nfrom a pure constituent quark model to end up with quantities that can be\ndirectly compared with experiment. The way how our approach works will be\nexemplified by means of a simple quark-antiquark-meson system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 14:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-20"}

Here we present the first spectroscopic observations of the Fe\nXVIII 974.86 AA emission line in an on-disk active region taken with then SUMER\ninstrument on SOHO. Fe XVIII has a peak formation temperature of 7.1 MK and\nprovides important constraints on the amount of impulsive heating in the\ncorona. Detailed evaluation of the spectra and comparison of the SUMER data\nwith soft X-ray images from the XRT on Hinode confirm that this line is\nunblended. We also compare the spectroscopic data with observations from the\nAIA 94 AA channel on SDO. The AIA 94 AA channel also contains Fe XVIII, but is\nblended with emission formed at lower temperatures. We find that is possible to\nremove the contaminating blends and form relatively pure Fe XVIII images that\nare consistent with the spectroscopic observations from SUMER. The observed\nspectra also contain the Ca XIV 943.63 AA line that, although a factor 2 to 6\nweaker than the Fe XVIII 974.86 AA line, allows us to probe the plasma around\n3.5 MK. The observed ratio between the two lines indicates (isothermal\napproximation) that most of the plasma in the brighter Fe XVIII active region\nloops is at temperatures between 3.5 and 4 MK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 14:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-20"}

IFD constructs an\nensemble of non-parametric sub-grid field configurations from the combination\nof the data in computer memory, representing constraints on possible field\nconfigurations, and prior assumptions on the sub-grid field statistics. Each of\nthese field configurations can formally be evolved to a later moment since any\ndifferential operator of the dynamics can act on fields living in continuous\nspace. However, these virtually evolved fields need again a representation by\ndata in computer memory. The maximum entropy principle of information theory\nguides the construction of updated datasets via entropic matching, optimally\nrepresenting these field configurations at the later time. The field dynamics\nthereby become represented by a finite set of evolution equations for the data\nthat can be solved numerically. The sub-grid dynamics is treated within an\nauxiliary analytic consideration and the resulting scheme acts solely on the\ndata space. It should provide a more accurate description of the physical field\ndynamics than simulation schemes constructed ad-hoc, due to the more rigorous\naccounting of sub-grid physics and the space discretization process.\nAssimilation of measurement data into an IFD simulation is conceptually\nstraightforward since measurement and simulation data can just be merged. The\nIFD approach is illustrated using the example of a coarsely discretized\nrepresentation of a thermally excited classical Klein-Gordon field.

It is shown that in a generic\nnonintegrable model the decay rate is finite in the hydrodynamic limit,\nconsistent with normal spin diffusion modes. On the other hand, in the gapless\nintegrable model within the XY regime of anisotropy Delta < 1 the behavior is\nanomalous with vanishing gamma(q,omega=0) proportional to |q|, in agreement\nwith dissipationless uniform transport.

Based on our earlier work, we propose a\ncompositional specification theory for timed automata with I/O distinction,\nwhich supports substitutive refinement. Our theory provides the operations of\nparallel composition for composing components at run-time, logical\nconjunction/disjunction for independent development, and quotient for\nincremental synthesis. The key novelty of our timed theory lies in a weakest\ncongruence preserving safety as well as bounded liveness properties. We show\nthat the congruence can be characterised by two linear-time semantics,\ntimed-traces and timed-strategies, the latter of which is derived from a\ngame-based interpretation of timed interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 11:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}
