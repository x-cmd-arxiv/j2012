In this spirit, we prove in this note that a\nprojective manifold $M$ with a K\\\"ahler metric with positive total scalar\ncurvature is uniruled, which is equivalent to every point of $M$ being\ncontained in a rational curve. We also prove that if $M$ possesses a K\\\"ahler\nmetric of total scalar curvature equal to zero, then either $M$ is uniruled or\nits canonical line bundle is torsion. The proof of the latter theorem is\npartially based on the observation that if $M$ is not uniruled, then the total\nscalar curvatures of all K\\\"ahler metrics on $M$ must have the same sign, which\nis either zero or negative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 16:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-13"}

The asymmetry rises from about\n0.1 to 0.2 as a function of the pseudorapidity and is measured with a relative\nprecision better than 7%. This measurement provides new stringent constraints\nfor parton distribution functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 17:16:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 11:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-21"}

The property we consider is selective decay, in\nwhich a Casimir of the ideal formulation (enstrophy in 2D flows, helicity in 3D\nflows) decays in time, while the energy stays essentially constant. This paper\nintroduces a mechanism that produces selective decay by enforcing Casimir\ndissipation in fluid dynamics. This mechanism turns out to be related in\ncertain cases to the numerical method of anticipated vorticity discussed in\n\\cite{SaBa1981,SaBa1985}. Several examples are given and a general theory of\nselective decay is developed that uses the Lie-Poisson structure of the ideal\ntheory. A scale-selection operator allows the resulting modifications of the\nfluid motion equations to be interpreted in several examples as parameterizing\nthe nonlinear, dynamical interactions between disparate scales.

The defect\ntextures and LC phases observed are investigated as a function of chirality,\nelastic anisotropy, particle polygonal arrangement and particle size. The\npresence of a polygonal network made of N circular inclusions results in defect\ntextures of a net charge of -(N-2)/2 per unit polygonal cell. As the chirality\nincreases, the LC matrix shows the following transition sequence: weakly\ntwisted cholesterics, 2D blue phases with non-singular/ singular defect\nlattices, cholesteric phases with only disclinations, and fingerprint\ncholesteric textures with disclinations and dislocations. For monomeric\nmesogens at concentrations far from the I/Ch phase transition and low\nchirality, for a given symmetry of the LC phase, the particle with weaker\n(stronger) confinement results in a phase with lower (higher) elastic energy,\nwhile at high chirality the elastic energy of a LC phase is proportional to the\nnumber of particles that form the polygonal network. Thus, hexagonal\n(triangular) particle arrangement results in low elastic energy at low (high)\nchirality. For semiflexible polymeric mesogens (high elastic anisotropy),\ndefect textures with fewer disclinations/ dislocations arise but due to layer\ndistortions we find a higher elastic energy than monomeric mesogens.

In the space of\nvelocity versus radius, the sample shows the wedge pattern expected from a\nradial shell, which is detected clearly here for the first time. This confirms\npredictions from an earlier model of formation of the GSS, which proposed that\nthe W Shelf is a shell from the third orbital wrap of the same tidal debris\nstream that produces the GSS, with the main body of the progenitor lying in the\nsecond wrap. We calculate the distortions in the shelf wedge pattern expected\nfrom its outward expansion and angular momentum, and show that these effects\nare echoed in the data. In addition, a hot, relatively smooth spheroid\npopulation is clearly present. We construct a bulge-disk-halo N-body model that\nagrees with surface brightness and kinematic constraints, and combine it with a\nsimulation of the GSS. From the contrasting kinematic signatures of the hot\nspheroid and shelf components, we decompose the observed stellar metallicity\ndistribution into contributions from each component using a non-parametric\nmixture model. The shelf component's metallicity distribution matches previous\nobservations of the GSS superbly, further strengthening the evidence they are\nconnected and bolstering the case for a massive progenitor of this stream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 18:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Past\nstudies of SN Ibc host environments have been biased towards high-mass,\nhigh-metallicity galaxies by focusing on SNe discovered in galaxy-targeted SN\nsearches. Our new observations more than double the total number of\nspectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published for\nuntargeted SN Ibc host environments, and extend to a median redshift about\ntwice as large as previous statistical studies (z = 0.04). For the 12 SNe Ib\nand 21 SNe Ic in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities of\nlog(O/H)+12 = 8.48 and 8.61, respectively, but determine that the discrepancy\nin the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant.\nThis median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the mass\nloss via metal-line driven winds (<30%), suggesting this does not play the\ndominant role in distinguishing SN Ib and Ic progenitors. However, the median\nmetallicity of the 7 broad-lined SN Ic (SN Ic-BL) in our sample is\nsignificantly lower, log(O/H)+12 = 8.34. The age of the young stellar\npopulation of SN Ic-BL host environments also seems to be lower than for SN Ib\nand Ic, but our age sample is small. A synthesis of SN Ibc host environment\nspectroscopy to date does not reveal a significant difference in SN Ib and Ic\nmetallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities for\nSN Ic-BL. This combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted SN searches\nintroduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicity\ndistribution of SN progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematic\neffects that play smaller roles.

We measure a slope of EW(Halpha) ~ (1+z)^(1.8)\nwith little mass dependence. Qualitatively, this measurement is a\nmodel-independent confirmation of the evolution of star forming galaxies with\nredshift. A quantitative conversion of EW(Halpha) to sSFR is very model\ndependent, because of differential reddening corrections between the continuum\nSED and the Balmer lines. The observed EW(Halpha) can be reproduced with a\nsimple model in which the SFR for galaxies rises to the epoch of z~2.5 and then\ndecreases with time to z = 0. The model implies that the EW(Halpha) rises to\n400 A at z=8. The sSFR evolves faster than EW(Halpha), as the mass-to-light\nratio also evolves with redshift. In this context, we find that the sSFR\nevolves as (1+z)^(3.2), nearly independent of mass, consistent with previous\nreddening insensitive estimates.

As a direct consequence one also predicts the vanishing of the quartic\nHiggs SM self-coupling at M_{SS} ~10^{11} GeV.

The Roche limit for a differentiated body\nis also closer to the planet than for a homogeneous satellite of the same mean\ndensity.

The initial stages of the disruption are similar to the\nevolution of a viscous fluid ellipsoid, which can be computed\nsemi-analytically. On the other hand, when a differentiated satellite is just\nwithin the Roche limit only the mantle is disrupted. This process is similar to\nRoche-lobe overflow in interacting binary stars and produces two narrow rings\non either side of a remnant satellite.

The Lya emission, detected over more than 30 kpc, is spatially\ncoincident with a concentration of galaxies visible in deep broad-band imaging.\nWhile these faint galaxies without spectroscopic redshifts cannot with\ncertainty be associated with one another or with the Lya emission, there are a\nnumber of compelling reasons why they very probably form a Milky Way halo-mass\ngroup at the Lya redshift. A filamentary structure, possibly consisting of Lya\nemission at very high equivalent width, and evidence for disturbed stellar\npopulations, suggest that the properties of the emitting region reflect ongoing\ngalaxy assembly, with recent galaxy mergers and star formation occurring in the\ngroup. Hence, the Lya provides unique insights into what is probably a key mode\nof galaxy formation at high redshifts. The Lya emission may be powered by\ncooling radiation or spatially extended star formation in the halo, but is\nunlikely to be fluorescence driven by either an AGN or one of the galaxies. The\nspatial profile of the emission is conspicuously different from that of typical\nLya emitters or Lyman break galaxies, which is consistent with the picture that\nextended emission of this kind represents a different stage in the galaxy\nformation process. Faint, extended Lya emitters such as these may be lower-mass\nanalogues of the brighter Lya blobs. Our observations provide further,\ncircumstantial evidence that galaxy mergers may promote the production and / or\nescape of ionizing radiation, and that the halos of interacting galaxies may be\nsignificant sources for ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 21:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This problem becomes even more difficult due to\ncomplications in modeling unknown interaction terms among high dimensional\nvariables. There is currently no variable selection method to overcome these\nlimitations. Hence, in this paper we propose a variable selection approach that\nis developed by connecting a kernel machine with the nonparametric multiple\nregression model. The advantages of our approach are that it can: (1) recover\nthe sparsity, (2) automatically model unknown and complicated interactions, (3)\nconnect with several existing approaches including linear nonnegative garrote,\nkernel learning and automatic relevant determinants (ARD), and (4) provide\nflexibility for both additive and nonadditive nonparametric models. Our\napproach may be viewed as a nonlinear version of a nonnegative garrote method.\nWe model the smoothing function by a least squares kernel machine and construct\nthe nonnegative garrote objective function as the function of the similarity\nmatrix. Since the multiple regression similarity matrix can be written as an\nadditive form of univariate similarity matrices corresponding to input\nvariables, applying a sparse scale parameter on each univariate similarity\nmatrix can reveal its relevance to the response variable. We also derive the\nasymptotic properties of our approach, and show that it provides a square root\nconsistent estimator of the scale parameters. Furthermore, we prove that\nsparsistency is satisfied with consistent initial kernel function coefficients\nunder certain conditions and give the necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsparsistency. An efficient coordinate descent/backfitting algorithm is\ndeveloped. A resampling procedure for our variable selection methodology is\nalso proposed to improve power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 01:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-14"}

Ion selectivity and permeation are based on simple laws\nof physics and chemistry. Ion channels are therefore ideal candidates for\nphysical investigation. A reduced model generates the selectivity of\nvoltage-gated L-type calcium channel under a wide range of ionic conditions\nusing only two parameters with unchanging values. The reasons behind the\nsuccess of this reduced model are investigated. Monte Carlo simulations are\nperformed investigating the role of flexibility of the side chains in the\nselectivity of calcium channels under a wide range of ionic conditions. Results\nsuggest that the exact location and mobility of oxygen ions have little effect\non the selectivity behavior of calcium channels. The first order determinant of\nselectivity in calcium channels is the density of charge in the selectivity\nfilter. Flexibility seems a second order determinant. Single channel planar\nlipid bilayer experiments are performed to determine the selectivity,\npermeation, and sialic acid specificity of a bacterial outer-membrane channel\nNanC of Ecoli. NanC exhibits a large unit conductance varying with the applied\nvoltage polarity, anion selectivity, and voltage gating. Unitary conductance of\nNanC decreases significantly in presence of the buffer HEPES. Alternate buffers\nare tested. Results suggest that the sialic acid specificity of NanC should be\nperformed in low concentration salt solutions without pH buffers adjusted to\nneutral pH 7.0. Neu5Ac changes the gating and considerably increases the ionic\nconductance of NanC. The effect of Neu5Ac on the unitary current through NanC\nsaturates at higher Neu5Ac concentrations. Interestingly, Neu5Ac reduces the\nionic conductance of OmpF: frequent, long closures are seen. Thus, in E.coli\nsialic acid translocation is specifically facilitated by NanC, and not by OmpF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 01:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-14"}

There are many advantages of treating variable selection as a\ngraphical model, such as it is easy to employ the single site updating as well\nas the cluster updating algorithm, suitable for problems with small sample size\nand larger variable number, easy to extend to nonparametric regression models\nand incorporate graphical prior information and so on. In a Bayesian variable\nselection Ising model the interactions are determined by the linear model\ncoefficients, so we systematically study the performance of different scale\nnormal mixture priors for the model coefficients by adopting the global-local\nshrinkage strategy. Our results prove that the best prior of the model\ncoefficients in terms of variable selection should maintain substantial weight\non small shrinkage instead of large shrinkage.

The genes within the same pathway are\nexpected to function together and hence may interact with each other. It is\nalso known that many genes, and so pathways, interact with other environmental\nvariables. However, no formal procedure has yet been developed to evaluate the\npathway-environment interaction. In this article, we propose a semiparametric\nmethod to model the pathway-environment interaction. The method connects a\nleast square kernel machine and a semiparametric mixed effects model. We model\nnonparametrically the environmental effect via a natural cubic spline. Both a\npathway effect and an interaction between a pathway and an environmental effect\nare modeled nonparametrically via a kernel machine, and we estimate variance\ncomponent representing an interaction effect under a semiparametric mixed\neffects model. We then employ a restricted likelihood ratio test and a score\ntest to evaluate the main pathway effect and the pathway-environment\ninteraction. The approach was applied to a genetic pathway data of Type II\ndiabetes, and pathways with either a significant main pathway effect, an\ninteraction effect or both were identified. Other methods previously developed\ndetermined many as having a significant main pathway effect only. Furthermore,\namong those significant pathways, we discovered some pathways having a\nsignificant pathway-environment interaction effect, a result that other methods\nwould not be able to detect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 04:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-14"}

Such\nsystems provide the most accurate and model-independent method for measuring\nthe fundamental parameters of these poorly understood yet numerous stars, which\ncurrently lack sufficient observations to precisely calibrate stellar evolution\nmodels. We fully solve for the masses and radii of three of the systems,\nfinding orbital periods in the range 1.5<P<4.9 days, with masses spanning\n0.35-0.50 Msun and radii between 0.38-0.50 Rsun, with uncertainties of\n~3.5-6.4% in mass and ~2.7-5.5% in radius. Close-companions in short-period\nbinaries are expected to be tidally-locked into fast rotational velocities,\nresulting in high levels of magnetic activity. This is predicted to inflate\ntheir radii by inhibiting convective flow and increasing star spot coverage.\nThe radii of the WTS systems are inflated above model predictions by ~3-12%, in\nagreement with the observed trend, despite an expected lower systematic\ncontribution from star spots signals at infrared wavelengths. We searched for\ncorrelation between the orbital period and radius inflation by combining our\nresults with all existing M-dwarf radius measurements of comparable precision,\nbut we found no statistically significant evidence for a decrease in radius\ninflation for longer period, less active systems. Radius inflation continues to\nexists in non-synchronised systems indicating that the problem remains even for\nvery low activity M-dwarfs.

However, this success is achieved provided one\nadmits three completely independent new components in the energy-stress tensor\n$T^{\\mu\\nu}$$-$inflaton, dark matter and dark energy, which though do not have\nany non-gravitational or laboratory evidence and have remained generally\nspeculative. Moreover, the dark energy poses a serious confrontation between\nfundamental physics and cosmology.\n  The present situation reminds us of Einstein's `biggest blunder' when he\nforced his theory to predict a static universe, perhaps guided by his religious\nconviction that the universe must be eternal and unchanging. It seems that we\nare making a similar blunder by forcing $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ into the field equations\nwhile the observations indicate that it is not needed. We seem to have a\ndeep-rooted conviction that the spacetime will remain empty unless we fill it\nby the energy-stress tensor. However, we have been ignoring numerous evidences\nearnestly indicating otherwise.\n  From a critical analysis of the present situation, we develop an entirely new\ninsight about the source of curvature in equations $R^{\\mu\\nu}=0$ which, though\nmay appear orthogonal to the usual understanding, is in striking agreement with\nall known phenomena in GR. Moreover, it answers some hitherto unexplained\npuzzles and circumvents some long-standing problems of the standard paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 18:46:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 00:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

We show that\nthe stochastic dynamics of non gauge-invariant systems is not unambiguously\ndefined. They typically do not relax to equilibrium steady states even in the\nabsence of extenal forces. Assuming both coordinate covariance and gauge\ninvariance, we derive a second-order Langevin equation with state-dependent\ndiffusion matrix and vanishing environmental forces. It differs from previous\nproposals but nevertheless entails the Einstein relation, a Maxwellian\nconditional steady state for the velocities, and the equipartition theorem. The\nover-damping limit leads to a stochastic differential equation in state space\nthat cannot be interpreted as a pure differential (Ito, Stratonovich or else).\nAt odds with the latter interpretations, the corresponding Fokker-Planck\nequation admits an equilibrium steady state; a detailed comparison with other\ntheories of state-dependent diffusion is carried out. We propose this as a\ntheory of diffusion in a heat bath with varying temperature. Besides\nequilibrium, a crucial experimental signature is the non-uniform steady spatial\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 13:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 12:22:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

The superconducting ground state of\nthe QCDxQED sector of the vacuum is associated with magnetic-field-assisted\nemergence of quark-antiquark condensates which carry quantum numbers of charged\nrho mesons (i.e., of electrically charged vector particles made of lightest, u\nand d, quarks and antiquarks). Here we demonstrate that this exotic\nelectromagnetic superconductivity of vacuum is also accompanied by even more\nexotic superfluidity of the neutral rho mesons. The superfluid component --\ndespite being electrically neutral -- turns out to be sensitive to an external\nelectric field as the superfluid may ballistically be accelerated by a test\nbackground electric field along the magnetic-field axis. In the ground state\nboth superconducting and superfluid components are inhomogeneous periodic\nfunctions of the transversal (with respect to the axis of the magnetic field)\nspatial coordinates.

We suggest, that the \"choice\" of degree of freedom (or\nquantum partitions), even if mathematically justified introduces an epistemic\nelement, not only in the systems but also in their classification. We retain,\ninstead, that there are not two classes of quantum states, entangled and\nfactorizable, but only a single class of states: the entangled states. In fact,\nthe factorizable states become entangled for a different choice of their\ndegrees of freedom (i.e. they are entangled with respect to other observables).\nIn the same way, there are no partitions of quantum systems which have an\nontologically superior status with respect to any other. For all these reasons,\nboth mathematical tools utilize(i.e quantum partitions or degrees of freedom)\nare responsible for creating an improper classification of quantum systems.\nFinally, we argue that we cannot speak about a classification of quantum\nsystems: all quantum states exhibit a uniquely objective nature, they are all\nentangled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 08:41:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 21:28:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 10:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-31"}

Its main hypothesis states indeed\nthat the classical trajectories of the particles are identical to the sample\nfunctions of a diffusion Markov process, whose conditional probability density\nis proposed as a substitute for the wave function. The Schroedinger equation\nand the so-called Nelson equations are used to determine the diffusion tensor\nand the drift vectors characteristic of such a process. It is then possible to\nwrite down the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations that are used to\ndetermine the conditional probability density, as well as the Fokker-Planck\nequation that is used to determine the normal probability density. This method\nis applied to several simple cases and the results obtained are compared with\nthose of the orthodox theory. Among the most important differences let us\nmention that any system evolving freely from any original state returns\nspontaneously to its ground state, that the definitions of the particles\nvelocities and momenta are impossible because the sample functions of a\ndiffusion Markov process nowhere possess a derivative with respect to time and\nthat the so-called collapse of the wave function is a mere mirage explained by\nthe updating choice between new and older initial conditions in the resolution\nof partial differential equations.

A common approach is to\nestimate the generalization error by resampling and then assume the resampled\nestimator follows a known distribution to form a confidence set [Kohavi 1995,\nMartin 1996,Yang 2006]. Alternatively, one might bootstrap the resampled\nestimator of the generalization error to form a confidence set. Unfortunately,\nthese methods do not reliably provide sets of the desired confidence. The poor\nperformance appears to be due to the lack of smoothness of the generalization\nerror as a function of the learned classifier.

We construct a confidence\nset for the generalization error by use of a smooth upper bound on the\ndeviation between the resampled estimate and generalization error.

Thus far, work has concentrated on models with one covariance function.\nHowever, in many practical situations additive models with multiple covariance\nfunctions may perform better, since the data may contain both long and short\nlength-scale phenomena. The long length-scales can be captured with global\nsparse approximations, such as fully independent conditional (FIC), and the\nshort length-scales can be modeled naturally by covariance functions with\ncompact support (CS). CS covariance functions lead to naturally sparse\ncovariance matrices, which are computationally cheaper to handle than full\ncovariance matrices. In this paper, we propose a new sparse Gaussian process\nmodel with two additive components: FIC for the long length-scales and CS\ncovariance function for the short length-scales.
