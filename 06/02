These include effects due to the truncation to finite model\nspaces where a numerical calculation is tractable, as well as physical terms\nnot included in the description in the first place. In the no-core shell model\n(NCSM) framework, we discuss two approaches to the effective interactions based\non (i) unitary transformations and (ii) effective field theory (EFT)\nprinciples. Starting from a given Hamiltonian, the unitary transformation\napproach is designed to take into account effects induced by the truncation to\nfinite model spaces in which a numerical calculation is performed. This\napproach was widely applied to the description of nuclear properties of light\nnuclei; we review the theory and present representative results. In the EFT\napproach, a Hamiltonian is always constructed in a truncated model space\naccording to the symmetries of the underlying theory, making use of power\ncounting to limit the number of interactions included in the calculations.\nHence, physical terms not explicitly included in the calculation are treated on\nthe same footing with the truncation to a finite model space. In this approach,\nwe review results for both nuclear and trapped atomic systems, for which the\neffective theories are formally similar, albeit describing different underlying\nphysics. Finally, the application of the EFT method of constructing effective\ninteractions to Gamow shell model is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 16:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-09"}

Recently, using similar\nsparsity-constraints in the Bayesian framework for inverse problems by encoding\nthem in the prior distribution has attracted attention. Important questions\nabout the relation between regularization theory and Bayesian inference still\nneed to be addressed when using sparsity promoting inversion. A practical\nobstacle for these examinations is the lack of fast posterior sampling\nalgorithms for sparse, high-dimensional Bayesian inversion: Accessing the full\nrange of Bayesian inference methods requires being able to draw samples from\nthe posterior probability distribution in a fast and efficient way. This is\nusually done using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms. In this\narticle, we develop and examine a new implementation of a single component\nGibbs MCMC sampler for sparse priors relying on L1-norms. We demonstrate that\nthe efficiency of our Gibbs sampler increases when the level of sparsity or the\ndimension of the unknowns is increased. This property is contrary to the\nproperties of the most commonly applied Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling\nschemes: We demonstrate that the efficiency of MH schemes for L1-type priors\ndramatically decreases when the level of sparsity or the dimension of the\nunknowns is increased. Practically, Bayesian inversion for L1-type priors using\nMH samplers is not feasible at all. As this is commonly believed to be an\nintrinsic feature of MCMC sampling, the performance of our Gibbs sampler also\nchallenges common beliefs about the applicability of sample based Bayesian\ninference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 17:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 13:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The groups have velocity\ndispersions of \\sigma_{v_{gsr}}=12.4+-5.0 km/s and \\sigma_{v_{gsr}}=14.9+-6.2\nkm/s, and are spatially extended (about several kpc) making it very unlikely\nthat they are bound systems, and are more likely to be debris of tidally\ndisrupted dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. Both groups are metal-poor\n(median metallicities of [Fe/H] = -1.6 dex and [Fe/H] =-2.1 dex), and have a\nsomewhat uncertain (due to small sample size) metallicity dispersion of ~0.4\ndex, suggesting dwarf galaxies as progenitors. Two additional RR Lyrae stars\nwith velocities consistent with those of the Cancer groups have been observed\n~25 deg east, suggesting possible extension of the groups in that direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 18:28:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 16:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

On average, the accreted stars are ~2.5 Gyrs older, and ~0.15 dex\nmore metal poor than the stars formed in-situ. Accreted stellar material\ntypically lies on the outskirts of galaxies; the average half-light radius of\nthe accreted stars is 2.6 times larger than that of the in-situ stars.

The number of clinical trials and\nrange of drugs formally studied is dwarfed by the number of written\ndescriptions of the many drugs taken by people. Analysis of these descriptions\nusing machine-learning techniques can provide a framework for learning about\nthese drug use experiences. Methods: We collected 1000 reports of 10 drugs from\nthe drug information website Erowid.org and formed a term-document frequency\nmatrix. Using variable selection and a random-forest classifier, we identified\na subset of words that differentiated between drugs. Results: A random forest\nusing a subset of 110 predictor variables classified with accuracy comparable\nto a random forest using the full set of 3934 predictors.

But when p>n, the lasso criterion is not strictly convex, and hence it may\nnot have a unique minimum. An important question is: when is the lasso solution\nwell-defined (unique)? We review results from the literature, which show that\nif the predictor variables are drawn from a continuous probability\ndistribution, then there is a unique lasso solution with probability one,\nregardless of the sizes of n and p. We also show that this result extends\neasily to $\\ell_1$ penalized minimization problems over a wide range of loss\nfunctions.\n  A second important question is: how can we deal with the case of\nnon-uniqueness in lasso solutions? In light of the aforementioned result, this\ncase really only arises when some of the predictor variables are discrete, or\nwhen some post-processing has been performed on continuous predictor\nmeasurements. Though we certainly cannot claim to provide a complete answer to\nsuch a broad question, we do present progress towards understanding some\naspects of non-uniqueness. First, we extend the LARS algorithm for computing\nthe lasso solution path to cover the non-unique case, so that this path\nalgorithm works for any predictor matrix. Next, we derive a simple method for\ncomputing the component-wise uncertainty in lasso solutions of any given\nproblem instance, based on linear programming. Finally, we review results from\nthe literature on some of the unifying properties of lasso solutions, and also\npoint out particular forms of solutions that have distinctive properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 21:34:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 20:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

In order to shed\nsome light on this problem, here we discuss a new determination of H_0 at\nintermediate redshifts (z ~ 1), using the following four cosmic probes: (i)\nmeasurements of the angular diameter distances (ADD) for galaxy clusters based\non the combination of Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and X-ray data (0.14 < z <\n0.89$), (ii) the inferred ages of old high redshift galaxies (OHRG) (0.62 < z <\n1.70), (iii) measurements of the Hubble parameter H(z) (0.1 < z < 1.8), and\n(iv) the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature (z=0.35). In our analysis,\nassuming a flat LCDM cosmology and considering statistical plus systematic\nerrors we obtain H_0 = 74.1^{+2.2}_{-2.2} km/s.Mpc (1sigma) which is a 3%\ndetermination of the Hubble constant at intermediate redshifts. We stress that\neach individual test adopted here has error bars larger than the ones appearing\nin the calibration of the extragalactic distance ladder. However, the\nremarkable complementarity among the four tests works efficiently in reducing\ngreatly the possible degeneracy on the space parameter (Omega_m,h) ultimately\nproviding a value of H_0 that is in excellent agreement with the determination\nusing recessional velocities and distances to nearby objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2012 00:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 22:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Recently, two broad diffuse\ninterstellar bands (DIBs) at 4881{\\AA} and 5450{\\AA} were attributed to the\nlinear version of propynylidene l-C3H2, a species whose more stable cyclic\nconformer c-C3H2 has been widely observed in the diffuse interstellar medium at\nradio wavelengths. This attribution has already been criticized on the basis of\nindirect plausibility arguments because the required column densities are quite\nlarge, N(l-C3H2)/EB-V = 4 \\times 1014 cm-2 mag-1. Here we present new\nmeasurements of N(l-C3H2) based on simultaneous 18-21 GHz VLA absorption\nprofiles of cyclic and linear C3H2 taken along sightlines toward extragalactic\nradiocontinuum background sources with foreground Galactic reddening EB-V = 0.1\n- 1.6 mag.

This problem has already been addressed in the\npast and closed-form expressions of the mean and variance have been obtained\nfor a simplified stochastic model of the gene expression. These results have\nbeen obtained under the assumption that the duration of all the protein\nproduction steps are exponentially distributed. In such a case, a Markovian\napproach (via Fokker-Planck equations) is used to derive analytic formulas of\nthe mean and the variance of the number of proteins at equilibrium. This\nassumption is however not totally satisfactory from a modeling point of view\nsince the distribution of the duration of some steps is more likely to be\nGaussian, if not almost deterministic. In such a setting, Markovian methods can\nno longer be used. A finer characterization of the fluctuations of the number\nof proteins is therefore of primary interest to understand the general economy\nof the cell. In this paper, we propose a new approach, based on marked Poisson\npoint processes, which allows to remove the exponential assumption. This is\napplied in the framework of the classical three stages models of the\nliterature: transcription, translation and degradation. The interest of the\nmethod is shown by recovering the classical results under the assumptions that\nall the durations are exponentially distributed but also by deriving new\nanalytic formulas when some of the distributions are not anymore exponential.\nOur results show in particular that the exponential assumption may,\nsurprisingly, underestimate significantly the variance of the number of\nproteins when some steps are in fact not exponentially distributed. This\ncounter-intuitive result stresses the importance of the statistical assumptions\nin the protein production process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2012 10:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

In particular, it has been successfully used for\nproving a number of results about the relation between the (adjacency matrix or\nLaplacian) spectrum of a graph and some of its properties. For instance, some\ncharacterizations of regular partitions, and bounds for some parameters, such\nas the independence and chromatic numbers, the diameter, the bandwidth, etc.,\nhave been obtained. For each parameter of a graph involving the cardinality of\nsome vertex sets, we can define its corresponding weight parameter by giving\nsome \"weights\" (that is, the entries of the positive eigenvector) to the\nvertices and replacing cardinalities by square norms. The key point is that\nsuch weights \"regularize\" the graph, and hence allow us to define a kind of\nregular partition, called \"pseudo-regular,\" intended for general graphs. Here\nwe show how to use interlacing for proving results about some weight parameters\nand pseudo-regular partitions of a graph.

The time and required effort to do sufficient testing\ngrow, as the size and complexity of the software grows, which may cause overrun\nof the project budget, delay in the development of software system or some test\ncases may not be covered. During SDLC (software development life cycle),\ngenerally the software testing phase takes around 40-70% of the time and cost.\nState-based testing is frequently used in software testing. Test data\ngeneration is one of the key issues in software testing. A properly generated\ntest suite may not only locate the errors in a software system, but also help\nin reducing the high cost associated with software testing. It is often desired\nthat test data in the form of test sequences within a test suite can be\nautomatically generated to achieve required test coverage.
