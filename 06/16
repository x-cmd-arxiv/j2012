The favored\ninterpretation, the \"calorimeter model,\" requires that supernova generated\ncosmic ray (CR) electrons cool rapidly via synchrotron radiation. However, this\ncooling should steepen their radio spectra beyond what is observed, and so\nenhanced ionization losses at low energies from high gas densities are also\nrequired. Further, evaluating the minimum energy magnetic field strength with\nthe traditional scaling of the synchrotron flux may underestimate the true\nvalue in massive starbursts if their magnetic energy density is comparable to\nthe hydrostatic pressure of their disks. Gamma-ray spectra of starburst\ngalaxies, combined with radio data, provide a less ambiguous estimate of these\nphysical properties in starburst nuclei. While the radio flux is most sensitive\nto the magnetic field, the GeV gamma-ray spectrum normalization depends\nprimarily on gas density. To this end, spectra above 100 MeV were constructed\nfor two nearby starburst galaxies, NGC 253 and M82, using Fermi data. Their\nnuclear radio and far-infrared spectra from the literature are compared to new\nmodels of the steady-state CR distributions expected from starburst galaxies.\nModels with high magnetic fields, favoring galaxy calorimetry, are overall\nbetter fits to the observations.

We\nconsider the k-colouring model, i.e. the root of T is assigned an arbitrary\ncolour and, conditional on this assignment, we take a random colouring of T. A\nbasic question here is whether the information of the assignment at the root\naffects the distribution of the colourings at the leaves. This is the so-called\nreconstruction/non-reconstruction problem. It is well known that d/ln d is a\nthreshold function for this problem, i.e.\n  * if k \\geq (1+\\eps)d/ln d, then the colouring of the root has a vanishing\neffect on the distribution of the colourings at the leaves, as the height of\nthe tree grows\n  * if $k\\leq (1-\\eps)d/ln d, then the colouring of the root biases the\ndistribution of the colouring of the leaves regardless of the height of the\ntree.\n  There is no apparent combinatorial reason why such a result should be true.\n  When k\\geq (1+\\eps)d/ ln d, the threshold implies the following: We can\ncouple two broadcasting processes that assign the root different colours such\nthat the probability of having disagreement at the leaves reduces with their\ndistance from the root. It is natural to perceive such coupling as a mapping\nfrom the colouring of the first broadcasting process to the colouring of the\nsecond one. Here, we study how can we have such a mapping \"combinatorially\".\nDevising a mapping where the disagreements vanish as we move away from the root\nturns out to be a non-trivial task to accomplish for any k \\leq d.\n  In this work we obtain a coupling which has the aforementioned property for\nany k>3d/ln d, i.e. much smaller than d. Interestingly enough, the decisions\nthat we make in the coupling are local.

Also, the magnetic deflection of the trajectories of the cosmic\nrays makes them potential probes of galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields.\nWe develop a Bayesian hierarchical model that can be used to compare different\nassociation models between the cosmic rays and source population, using Bayes\nfactors. A measurement model with directional uncertainties and accounting for\nnon-uniform sky exposure is incoporated into the model. The methodology allows\nus to learn about astrophysical parameters, such as those governing the source\nluminosity function and the cosmic magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 18:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-18"}

In the classical auction theory for agents\nwith linear utility and single-dimensional preferences, Bulow and Roberts\n(1989) show that the optimal auction of Myerson (1981) is in fact optimizing\nmarginal revenue. In particular Myerson's virtual values are exactly the\nderivative of an appropriate revenue curve.\n  This paper considers mechanism design in environments where the agents have\nmulti-dimensional and non-linear preferences. Understanding good auctions for\nthese environments is considered to be the main challenge in Bayesian optimal\nmechanism design. In these environments maximizing marginal revenue may not be\noptimal and there is sometimes no direct way to implement the marginal revenue\nmaximization. Our contributions are three fold: we characterize the settings\nfor which marginal revenue maximization is optimal (by identifying an important\ncondition that we call revenue linearity), we give simple procedures for\nimplementing marginal revenue maximization in general, and we show that\nmarginal revenue maximization is approximately optimal. Our approximation\nfactor smoothly degrades in a term that quantifies how far the environment is\nfrom ideal (where marginal revenue maximization is optimal). Because the\nmarginal revenue mechanism is optimal for single-dimensional agents, our\ngeneralization immediately approximately extends many results for\nsingle-dimensional agents.\n  One of the biggest open questions in Bayesian algorithmic mechanism design is\ndeveloping methodologies that are not brute-force in the size of the agent type\nspace. Our methods identify a subproblem that, e.g., for unit-demand agents\nwith values drawn from product distributions, enables approximation mechanisms\nthat are polynomial in the dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 18:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 19:23:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 19:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-06"}

The novelty of the proposed\napproach relies on a unique type of entangled-photon source and a new physical\nmechanism for efficiently sharing keys. The new source produces entangled\nphotons with orbital angular momenta (OAM) randomly distributed among Fibonacci\nnumbers.

While\nthis coupling effect has been well confirmed for symmetrical tilt GBs, little\nis known about the coupling ability of asymmetrical boundaries. In this work we\napply a combination of molecular dynamics and phase field crystal simulations\nto investigate stress-driven motion of asymmetrical GBs between cubic crystals\nover the entire range of inclination angles. Our main findings are that the\ncoupling effect exists for most of the asymmetrical GBs and that the coupling\nfactor exhibits a non-trivial dependence on both the misorientation and\ninclination angles. This dependence is characterized by a discontinuous change\nof sign of the coupling factor, which reflects a transition between two\ndifferent coupling modes over a narrow range of angles. Importantly, the\nmagnitude of the coupling factor becomes large or divergent within this\ntransition region, thereby giving rise to a sliding-like behavior. Our results\nare interpreted in terms of a diagram presenting the domains of existence of\nthe two coupling modes and the transition region between them in the plane of\nmisorientation and inclination angles. The simulations reveal some of the\ndislocation mechanisms responsible for the motion of asymmetrical tilt GBs.

Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from SDSS DR7, together with a\ncosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star\nformation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M_star > 5 x 10^9\nM_sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing\nand ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly\naccounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 Gyr\nago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their\ntime of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the\nevolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we\nconstrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of\nsatellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant\nprocess for building up all quiescent galaxies at M_star < 10^10 M_sun. We then\nconstrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'\nquenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall,\nafter which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of < 0.8\nGyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but do\nnot depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent\nfraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a\nlower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible\nfor up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long\ntime delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar\nmass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact\nprovides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 22:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Since the signals received at different BSs are correlated,\ndistributed source coding strategies are potentially beneficial, and can be\nimplemented via sequential source coding with side information. For the problem\nof compression with side information, available compression strategies based on\nthe criteria of maximizing the achievable rate or minimizing the mean square\nerror are reviewed first. It is observed that, in either case, each BS requires\ninformation about a specific covariance matrix in order to realize the\nadvantage of distributed source coding. Since this covariance matrix depends on\nthe channel realizations corresponding to other BSs, a robust compression\nmethod is proposed for a practical scenario in which the information about the\ncovariance available at each BS is imperfect. The problem is formulated using a\ndeterministic worst-case approach, and an algorithm is proposed that achieves a\nstationary point for the problem. Then, BS selection is addressed with the aim\nof reducing the number of active BSs, thus enhancing the energy efficiency of\nthe network. An optimization problem is formulated in which compression and BS\nselection are performed jointly by introducing a sparsity-inducing term into\nthe objective function. An iterative algorithm is proposed that is shown to\nconverge to a locally optimal point. From numerical results, it is observed\nthat the proposed robust compression scheme compensates for a large fraction of\nthe performance loss induced by the imperfect statistical information.\nMoreover, the proposed BS selection algorithm is seen to perform close to the\nmore complex exhaustive search solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 22:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-19"}

A quadrature representation with built-in phase\nshifters is proposed for such systems.

These results reveal considerable insights of issue of physical\nrealizability of such quantum systems. The problem of coherent quantum LQG\nfeedback control studied in [35,50] is re-investigated in depth. Firstly, the\noptimization methods in [35,50] are extended to a multi-step optimization\nalgorithm which utilizes ideal squeezers. Secondly, a two-stage optimization\napproach is proposed on the basis of controller parametrization. Numerical\nstudies show that closed-loop systems designed via the second approach may\noffer LQG control performance even better than that when the closed-loop\nsystems are in the vacuum state. When ideal squeezers in a close-loop system\nare replaced by (more realistic) degenerate parametric amplifiers, a sufficient\ncondition is derived for the asymptotic stability of the resultant new\nclosed-loop system; the issue of performance convergence is also discussed in\nthe LQG control setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 07:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-19"}

It becomes natural to\nextend our previous interpretation in which electromagnetic field tensor\nrepresents angular momentum of photon or spacetime fluid (aether!) in the\npresence of sources such that the duality between field and source disappears.\nBoth Gordon current and spin current are proposed to have 'spinning origin'.\nFormal expression of Gordon current makes it possible to apply the idea of\noptical vortex in this case, and quantized vortex and quantized orbital angular\nmomentum could be related with the conjecture of mechanical interpretation of\nelectric charge.

Every\nsymmetric monoidal model category has an underlying symmetric monoidal\n$(\\infty,1)$-category and the first notion should be understood as a mere\n\"presentation\" of the second.

In the process we also describe the link between the\nconstruction of ordinary spectra and the one of symmetric spectra. As a\ncorollary, we obtain a precise universal characterization for the motivic\nstable homotopy theory of schemes with its symmetric monoidal structure. This\ncharacterization trivializes the problem of finding motivic monoidal\nrealizations and opens the way to compare the motivic theory of schemes with\nother motivic theories.\n  As an application we provide a new approach to the theory of noncommutative\nmotives by constructing a stable motivic homotopy theory for the noncommutative\nspaces of Kontsevich.

Our universal property for the\nclassical theory for schemes provides a canonical monoidal map towards these\nnew noncommutative motives and allows us to compare the two theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 08:49:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 08:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 10:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

One way to achieve this is\nby use of periodical calibration phases, during which the BMI system (or an\nexternal human demonstrator) instructs the user to perform certain movements or\nbehaviors. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) calibration phases\ninterrupt the autonomous operation of the BMI and (ii) between two calibration\nphases the BMI performance might not be stable but continuously decrease. A\nbetter alternative would be that the BMI decoder is able to continuously adapt\nin an unsupervised manner during autonomous BMI operation, i.e. without knowing\nthe movement intentions of the user.\n  In the present article, we present an efficient method for such unsupervised\ntraining of BMI systems for continuous movement control. The proposed method\nutilizes a cost function derived from neuronal recordings, which guides a\nlearning algorithm to evaluate the decoding parameters. We verify the\nperformance of our adaptive method by simulating a BMI user with an optimal\nfeedback control model and its interaction with our adaptive BMI decoder. The\nsimulation results show that the cost function and the algorithm yield fast and\nprecise trajectories towards targets at random orientations on a 2-dimensional\ncomputer screen. For initially unknown and non-stationary tuning parameters,\nour unsupervised method is still able to generate precise trajectories and to\nkeep its performance stable in the long term. The algorithm can optionally work\nalso with neuronal error signals instead or in conjunction with the proposed\nunsupervised adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 13:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-19"}

The model\nis a two mode truncation of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation subject to\ncompressive stress. We consider parameter regimes where the first mode is\nunstable and the second mode can be either stable or unstable, and the\nremaining modes (neglected) are always stable. Material parameters used\ncorrespond to silicon. The two mode model Hamiltonian is the sum of a\n(diagonal) kinetic energy term and a potential energy term. The form of the\npotential energy function suggests an analogy with isomerisation reactions in\nchemistry. We therefore study the dynamics of the buckled beam using the\nconceptual framework established for the theory of isomerisation reactions.\nWhen the second mode is stable the potential energy surface has an index one\nsaddle and when the second mode is unstable the potential energy surface has an\nindex two saddle and two index one saddles. Symmetry of the system allows us to\nconstruct a phase space dividing surface between the two \"isomers\" (buckled\nstates). The energy range is sufficiently wide that we can treat the effects of\nthe index one and index two saddles in a unified fashion. We have computed\nreactive fluxes, mean gap times and reactant phase space volumes for three\nstress values at several different energies. In all cases the phase space\nvolume swept out by isomerizing trajectories is considerably less than the\nreactant density of states, proving that the dynamics is highly nonergodic. The\nassociated gap time distributions consist of one or more `pulses' of\ntrajectories.

We do celebrate any agreements in results derived from these two\ndistinct approaches: i.e. the dynamical versus the topological approach. Here\nwe consider the Corrigan-Olive-Fairlie-Nuyts solution based on which we study\nthe stability of the 't Hooft- Polyakov outer field, known as its Higgs vacuum,\nand derive its stability, dynamically, from the equations of motion rather than\nfrom the familiar topological approach. Then we use our derived result of the\npreservation of the Higgs vacuum asymptotically to derive the stability of the\n't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, even if inner core is perturbed, where we base that\non observing that the magnetic charge must be conserved if the Higgs vacuum is\npreserved asymptotically. We also, alternatively, note stability of 't\nHooft-Polyakov monopole and the conservation of its magnetic charge by again\nusing the result of the Higgs vacuum asymptotic preservation to use Eq.(5) to\nshow that no non-Abelian radiation allowed out of the core as long as the Higgs\nvacuum is preserved and restored, by the equations of motion, if perturbed. We\nstart by deriving the asymptotic equations of motion that are valid for the\nmonopole's field outside its core; next we derive certain constraints from the\nasymptotic equations of motion of the Corrigan-Olive-Fairlie-Nuyts solution to\nthe 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole using the Lagrangian formalism of singular\ntheories, in particular that of Gitman and Tyutin. The derived constraints will\nshow clearly the stability of the monopole's Higgs vacuum its restoration by\nthe equations of motion of the Higgs vacuum, if disturbed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 21:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-20"}

The company is then locked up in the storage contract and exposed to\nupward market prices, which reduce the company's profit and may even bring it\nbelow zero. We propose a protection means based on an insurance contract, by\nwhich the cloud purchaser is indemnified when the current storage price exceeds\na pre-defined threshold. By applying the financial options theory, we provide a\nformula for the insurance price (the premium). By using historical data on\nmarket prices for disks, we apply the formula in realistic scenarios. We show\nthat the premium grows nearly quadratically with the length of the coverage\nperiod as long as this is below one year, but grows more slowly, though faster\nthan linearly, over longer coverage periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 18:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-20"}
