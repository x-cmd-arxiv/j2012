We focus on the\nassociation of the C-terminal domain (CA-C) of the human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) capsid protein. By combining all-atom simulations with specialized\nsampling techniques we measure the water density distribution during the\napproach of two CA-C proteins as a function of separation and amino acid\nsequence in the interfacial region. The simulations demonstrate that CA-C\nprotein-protein interactions sit at the edge of a dewetting transition and that\nthis mesoscopic manifestation of the underlying liquid-vapor phase transition\ncan be readily manipulated by biology or protein engineering to significantly\naffect association behavior. While the wild type protein remains wet until\ncontact, we identify a set of in silico mutations, in which three hydrophilic\namino acids are replaced with nonpolar residues, that leads to dewetting prior\nto association. The existence of dewetting depends on the size and relative\nlocations of substituted residues separated by nm length scales, indicating\nlong range cooperativity and a sensitivity to surface topography. These\nobservations identify important details which are missing from descriptions of\nprotein association based on buried hydrophobic surface area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 18:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Galactic outflows driven by supernovae/stellar winds are the\nleading mechanism for explaining this fact. The scaling relation between galaxy\nmass and outer rotation velocity (also known as the baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation, BTF) has recently been used as evidence against this viewpoint. We\nuse a LCDM based semi-analytic disk galaxy formation model to investigate these\nclaims. In our model, galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher\ngas fractions are more efficient at ejecting gas from galaxies. This is due to\nthe fact that galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher gas\nfractions tend to live in dark matter haloes with lower circular velocities,\nfrom which less energy is required to escape the potential well. In our model\nthe intrinsic scatter in the BTF is 0.15 dex, and mostly reflects scatter in\ndark halo concentration. The observed scatter, equal to 0.24 dex, is dominated\nby measurement errors. The best estimate for the intrinsic scatter is that it\nis less than 0.15 dex, and thus our LCDM based model (which does not include\nall possible sources of scatter) is only just consistent with this. In our\nmodel, gas rich galaxies, at fixed virial velocity (V_vir), with lower stellar\nmasses have lower baryonic masses. This is consistent with the expectation that\ngalaxies with lower stellar masses have had less energy available to drive an\noutflow. However, when the outer rotation velocity (V_flat) is used the\ncorrelation has the opposite sign, with a slope in agreement with observations.\nThis is due to scatter in the relation between V_flat and V_vir. In summary,\ncontrary to some previous claims, we show that basic features of the BTF are\nconsistent with a LCDM based model in which the low efficiency of galaxy\nformation is determined by galactic outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Recent studies have suggested that a significant fraction of the\nfirst stars may have had low masses (a few M_sun). Such stars do not leave BH\nremnants and they have softer spectra, with copious infrared (IR) radiation at\nphoton energies around 1eV. Similar to LW and X-ray photons, these photons have\na mean-free path comparable to the Hubble distance, building up an early IR\nbackground. Here we show that if soft-spectrum stars, with masses of a few\nM_sun, contributed more than 1% of the UV background (or their mass fraction\nexceeded 90%), then their IR radiation dominated radiative feedback in the\nearly Universe. The feedback is different from the UV feedback from high-mass\nstars, and occurs through the photo-detachment of H^- ions, necessary for\nefficient H_2 formation. Nevertheless, we find that the baryon fraction which\nmust be incorporated into low-mass stars in order to suppress H_2-cooling is\nonly a factor of few higher than for high-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 20:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the formation mechanism of MSPs by considering the pulsar recycling\nprocess in both intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) and low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs). The IMXBs mainly lead to the formation of binary MSPs with a\nmassive carbon-oxygen (CO) or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (ONeMg WD)\ncompanion, whereas the LMXBs form recycled pulsars with a helium white dwarf\n(He WD) companion. We discuss the accretion physics leading to the spin-up line\nin the PPdot-diagram and demonstrate that such a line cannot be uniquely\ndefined. We derive a simple expression for the amount of accreted mass needed\nfor any given pulsar to achieve its equilibrium spin and apply this to explain\nthe observed differences of the spin distributions of recycled pulsars with\ndifferent types of companions. From numerical calculations we present further\nevidence for significant loss of rotational energy in accreting X-ray MSPs in\nLMXBs during the Roche-lobe decoupling phase (Tauris 2012) and demonstrate that\nthe same effect is negligible in IMXBs.

Properties of the\nheavy electron liquid are best probed by NMR Knight shift measurements, which\nprovide a direct measure of the behavior of the heavy electron liquid that\nemerges below the Kondo lattice coherence temperature as the lattice of local\nmoments hybridizes with the background conduction electrons. Because the\ntransfer of spectral weight between the localized and itinerant electronic\ndegrees of freedom is gradual, the Kondo liquid typically coexists with the\nlocal moment component until the material orders at low temperatures. The\ntwo-fluid formula captures this behavior in a broad range of materials in the\nparamagnetic state. In order to investigate two-fluid behavior and the onset\nand physical origin of different long range ordered ground states in heavy\nelectron materials, we have extended Knight shift measurements to\nURu$_2$Si$_2$, CeIrIn$_5$ and CeRhIn$_5$. In CeRhIn$_5$ we find that the\nantiferromagnetic order is preceded by a relocalization of the Kondo liquid,\nproviding independent evidence for a local moment origin of antiferromagnetism.\nIn URu$_2$Si$_2$ the hidden order is shown to emerge directly from the Kondo\nliquid and so is not associated with local moment physics. Our results imply\nthat the nature of the ground state is strongly coupled with the hybridization\nin the Kondo lattice in agreement with phase diagram proposed by Yang and\nPines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 21:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

We calibrated the p-factor for several\nGalactic Cepheids that have both the latest BW distances and independent\ndistances either from Hipparcos parallaxes or main-sequence fitting distances\nto Cepheid-hosted stellar clusters. Based on 25 Cepheids, the calibrated\np-factor relation is consistent with latest p-factor relation in literature.\nThe calibrated p-factor relation also indicates that this relation may not be\nlinear and may exhibit an intrinsic scatter. We also examined the discrepancy\nof empirical p-factors for delta Cephei, and found that the reasons for this\ndiscrepancy include the disagreement of angular diameters, the treatment of\nradial velocity data, and the phase interval adopted during the fitting\nprocedure. Finally, we investigated the impact of the input p-factor in two BW\nmethodologies for delta Cephei, and found that different p-factors can be\nadopted in these BW methodologies and yet result in the same angular diameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2012 00:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

These are supplemented with archival mid-infrared (MIR) observations\ntaken with the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer). We note the presence of\noff-axis low-ionization spokes along a PA of 65 degrees, and associated collars\nof enhanced [OIII] emission. The spokes appear to consist of dense\ncondensations having low-excitation tails, possibly arising due to UV shadowing\nand/or ram-pressure stripping of material. Line ratios imply that most of the\nemission arises through photo-ionisation, and is unlikely to derive from\npost-shock cooling regions. An analysis of these features in the MIR suggests\nthat they may also be associated with high levels of emission from polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), together with various permitted and forbidden\nline transitions. Such high levels of PAH emission, where they are confirmed,\nmay develop as a result of preferentially enhanced FUV pumping of the\nmolecules, or shattering of larger grains within local shocks. Although H2\nemission may also contribute to these trends, it is argued that shock-excited\ntransitions would lead to markedly differing results.

Electricity markets currently are\nrun in a way that participating generators must supply contracted amounts. And\nyet, renewable energy generators such as wind power generators cannot supply\ncontracted amounts with certainty. Thus, alternative market architectures must\nbe considered where there are aggregator entities who participate in the\nelectricity market by buying power from the renewable energy generators, and\nassuming risk of any shortfall from contracted amounts. In this paper, we\npropose auction mechanisms that can be used by the aggregators for procuring\nstochastic resources, such as wind power. The nature of stochastic resources is\ndifferent from classical resources in that such a resource is only available\nstochastically. The distribution of the generation is private information, and\nthe system objective is to truthfully elicit such information. We introduce a\nvariant of the VCG mechanism for this problem. We also propose a non-VCG\nmechanism with a contracted-payment-plus-penalty payoff structure. We\ngeneralize the basic mechanisms in various ways.

Still, a significant isotope exponent (IE) (in certain cases, much\nlarger than 0.5, the canonical BCS value) is observed experimentally. This has\nled to the assumption that phonons are also involved up to a certain extent.\nThe magnitude of the IE in cuprates depends strongly on the number of doped\nholes, p, in the CuO2 planes and therefore, may indicate that phonons play\ndifferent quantitative roles as the mediating boson at different regions of the\nTc-p phase diagram. Based on recent experiments on Fermi-surface reconstruction\nfrom the thermoelectric transport measurements (Nature Commun. 2:432 doi:\n10.1038/ncomms1440 (2011)) and on magnetic field induced charge order in\nYBa2Cu3O7-delta (Nature 477, 191 (2011)), we propose a very simple scenario\nwhere isotope substitutions affect the stripe state via the coupling to the\nlattice and thereby change the superconducting Tc.

We then turn to Short-Circuit\n(Left-Sequential) Logic as presented in [BP10b], where the evaluation may be\n'short-circuited', thus preventing some, if not all, of the atomic propositions\nin a term being evaluated. We propose evaluation trees as a natural semantics\nfor both logics and provide axiomatizations for the least identifying variant\nof each.

Here we study the possible\neffects of mixing in the mass-losing stars for a range in secondary star masses\nand metallicities. We find that tidal locking can induce rotational mixing\nprior to contact and thus affect the evolution of the secondary star if the\neffects of the Spruit-Tayler dynamo are included both for angular momentum and\nchemical transport. Once contact is made, the effect of mass transfer tends to\nbe more rapid than the evolutionary time scale, so the effects of mixing are no\nlonger directly important, but the mass transfer strips matter to inner layers\nthat may have been affected by the mixing. These effects are enhanced for\nsecondaries of 1-1.2 Msun and for lower metallicities. We discuss the possible\nimplications for the paucity of carbon in the secondaries of the cataclysmic\nvariable SS Cyg and the black hole candidate XTE J1118+480 and for the\nprogenitor evolution of Type Ia supernovae. We also address the issue of the\norigin of blue straggler stars in globular and open clusters. We find that for\nmodels that include rotation consistent with that observed for some blue\nstraggler stars, evolution is chemically homogeneous. This leads to tracks in\nthe HR diagram that are brighter and bluer than the non-rotating main-sequence\nturn-off point. Rotational mixing could thus be one of the factors that\ncontribute to the formation of blue stragglers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2012 13:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 15:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 16:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The rate of removal of particles from any given layer depends upon the\nrate of removal of particles from the layer above which acts as a source of\nuncovering and exposure of particles to the resuspending flow. The primary\nresuspension rate constant for an individual particle within a layer is based\non the Rock'n'Roll (R'n'R) model using non-Gaussian statistics for the\naerodynamic forces acting on the particles (Zhang et al., 2012). The coupled\nlayer equations that describe multilayer resuspension of all the particles in\neach layer are based on the generic lattice model of Friess & Yadigaroglu\n(2001) which is extended here to include the influence of layer coverage and\nparticle size distribution. We consider the influence of layer thickness on the\nresuspension along with the spread of adhesion within layers, and the\nstatistics of non-Gaussian versus Gaussian removal forces including their\ntimescale. Unlike its weak influence on long-term resuspension rates for\nmonolayers, this timescale plays a crucial and influential role in multilayer\nresuspension. Finally we compare model predictions with those of a large-scale\nand a mesoscale resuspension test, STORM (Castelo et al., 1999) and BISE\n(Alloul-Marmor, 2002).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2012 13:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

We obtain an exact expression\nbased on the coordinate velocity, as first set forth by Einstein, and present a\ndiscussion on the effect of velocity anisotropy. We conclude that the\nanisotropy in the coordinate velocity, as the velocity apparent to a distant\nobserver, gives rise to a third order error in the deflection angle, so that\nthe practical astronomical observations from gravitational lensing data remain\ninconclusive on the anisotropy. However, measurement of Shapiro delay provides\na fairly convenient way to determine whether the spacetime is optically\nanisotropic for a distant observer or not. We calculate the Shapiro delay for a\nround trip path between Earth and Venus and observe excellent agreement to two\nexperimentally reported values measured during a time span of six months in\n1967, without any need to extra fitting parameters. This is while the expected\ndelay obtained from an isotropic light velocity as described by Einstein's\nmodel suffers from much larger errors under similar conditions. This article\nillustrates the usefulness of the equivalent medium theory in understanding of\ngeneral theory of relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2012 15:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-23"}

In this\npaper, we study the discrete memoryless cognitive interference channel (DM-CIC)\nin which the cognitive transmitter non-causally knows the message of the\nprimary transmitter. The capacity of this channel is not known in general; it\nis only known in some special cases. Inspired by the concept of less noisy\nbroadcast channel (BC), in this work we introduce the notion of less noisy\ncognitive interference channel. Unlike BC, due to the inherent asymmetry of the\ncognitive channel, two different less noisy channels are distinguishable; these\nare named the primary-less-noisy and cognitive-less-noisy channels. We derive\ncapacity region for the latter case, by introducing inner and outer bounds on\nthe capacity of the DM-CIC and showing that these bounds coincide for the\ncognitive-less-noisy channel. Having established the capacity region, we prove\nthat superposition coding is the optimal encoding technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2012 15:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2012 21:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-09"}

The residual polynomials of\nthe semi-iterative methods under consideration are linked to a family of\nco-dilated ultraspherical polynomials. This connection makes it possible to\nincrease the decay of the residual polynomials at the origin by means of a\ndilation parameter. This increased decay has advantages when solving linear\nill-posed equations in which the spectrum of the involved operators is\nclustered at the origin. The convergence order of the new semi-iterative\nmethods turns out to be the same as the convergence order of the original\n\\nu-methods.
