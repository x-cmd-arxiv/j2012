This\nanalysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additional\nphotometrically identified SNe Ia within the redshift range 0.1<z<1.1. The\nvolumetric SNR_Ia evolution is consistent with a rise to z~1.0 that follows a\npower-law of the form (1+z)^alpha, with alpha=2.11+/-0.28. This evolutionary\ntrend in the SNLS rates is slightly shallower than that of the cosmic\nstar-formation history over the same redshift range. We combine the SNLS rate\nmeasurements with those from other surveys that complement the SNLS redshift\nrange, and fit various simple SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD) models to the\ncombined data. A simple power-law model for the DTD (i.e., proportional to\nt^-beta) yields values from beta=0.98+/-0.05 to beta=1.15+/-0.08 depending on\nthe parameterization of the cosmic star formation history. A two-component\nmodel, where SNR_Ia is dependent on stellar mass (Mstellar) and star formation\nrate (SFR) as SNR_Ia(z)=AxMstellar(z) + BxSFR(z), yields the coefficients\nA=1.9+/-0.1 SNe/yr/M_solar and B=3.3+/-0.2 SNe/yr/(M_solar/yr). More general\ntwo-component models also fit the data well, but single Gaussian or exponential\nDTDs provide significantly poorer matches. Finally, we split the SNLS sample\ninto two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that the\ngeneral behavior in the rates of faster-declining SNe Ia (0.8<s<1.0) is\nsimilar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects\n(1.0<s<1.3) out to z~0.8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 16:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Characterization of these states is a\nfundamental problem important in waveguide design and testing, especially for\noptical applications. In this work, I have developed a novel interferometric\nmethod that provides complete characterization of optical waveguide modes and\ntheir superposition states. The basic idea of the method is to study the\ninterference of the beam radiated from an optical waveguide with an external\nreference beam, and detect different waveguide modes in the time-domain by\nchanging the relative optical paths of the two beams. In particular, this\nmethod, called cross-correlation or C$^2$-imaging, provides the relative\namplitudes of the modes and their group delays. For every mode, one can\ndetermine the dispersion, intensity and phase distributions, and also local\npolarization properties.

The techniques\ncurrently available in the literature are either too theoretical, applying to\nonly a small number of knots, or are designed to only deal with a specific\nknot. The thesis builds on the results of Herald, Kirk and Livingston [HKL10]\nand Tamulis [Tam02] to give a series of criteria, using twisted Alexander\npolynomials, for determining whether a knot is of infinite order in C.\n  There are two immediate applications of these theorems. The first is to give\nthe structure of the subgroups of the concordance group C and the algebraic\nconcordance group G generated by the prime knots of 9 or fewer crossings. This\nshould be of practical value to the knot-theoretic community, but more\nimportantly it provides interesting examples of phenomena both in the algebraic\nand geometric concordance groups. The second application is to find the\nconcordance orders of all prime knots with up to 12 crossings. At the time of\nwriting of this thesis, there are 325 such knots listed as having unknown\nconcordance order. The thesis includes the computation of the orders of all\nexcept two of these.\n  In addition to using twisted Alexander polynomials to determine the\nconcordance order of a knot, a theorem of Cochran, Orr and Teichner [COT03] is\napplied to prove that the n-twisted doubles of the unknot are not slice for n\nnot 0 or 2. This technique involves analysing the `second-order' invariants of\na knot; that is, slice invariants (in this case, signatures) of a set of\nmetabolising curves on a Seifert surface for the knot. The thesis extends the\nresult to provide a set of criteria for the n-twisted double of a general knot\nK to be slice; that is, of order 0 in C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 16:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

Using 132, 20-minute observations, several instances of MSTIDs were\ndetected, all having wavefronts aligned northwest to southeast and mostly\npropagating toward the southwest, consistent with previous studies of MSTIDs.\nHowever, some were also found to move toward the northeast. It was found that\nboth classes of MSTIDs were only found when sporadic-E (Es) layers of moderate\npeak density (1.5<foEs<3 MHz) were present. Limited fbEs data from one\nionosonde suggests that there was a significant amount of structure with the Es\nlayers during observations when foEs>3 MHz that was not present when 1.5<foEs<3\nMHz. No MSTIDs were observed either before midnight or when the F-region height\nwas increasing at a relatively high rate, even when these Es layers were\nobserved. Combining this result with AE indices which were relatively high at\nthe time (an average of about 300 nT and maximum of nearly 700 nT), it is\ninferred that both the lack of MSTIDs and the increase in F-region height are\ndue to substorm-induced electric fields. The northeastward-directed MSTIDs were\nstrongest post-midnight during times when the F-region was observed to be\ncollapsing relatively quickly. This implies that these two occurrences are\nrelated and likely both caused by rare shifts in F-region neutral wind\ndirection from southwest to northwest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 17:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

X-ray binaries are usually divided in persistent and transient\nsources. For ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), the mass transfer rate is\nexpected to be a strong function of orbital period, predicting persistent\nsources at short periods and transients at long periods. Aims. For 14 UCXBs\nincluding two candidates, we investigate the long-term variability and average\nluminosity with the purpose of learning how often a source can be expected to\nbe visible above a given luminosity, and we compare the derived luminosities\nwith the theoretical predictions. Methods. We use data from the RXTE All-Sky\nMonitor because of its long-term, unbiased observations. Many UCXBs are faint,\ni.e., they have a count rate at the noise level for most of the time. Still,\ninformation can be extracted from the data, either by using only reliable data\npoints or by combining the bright-end variability behavior with the\ntime-averaged luminosity. Results. Luminosity probability distributions show\nthe fraction of time that a source emits above a given luminosity. All UCXBs\nshow significant variability and relatively similar behavior, though the\ntime-averaged luminosity implies higher variability in systems with a period\nlonger than 40 min. Conclusions. There is no large difference in the\nstatistical luminosity behavior of what we usually call persistent and\ntransient sources. UCXBs with a period below ~30 min have a time-averaged\nbolometric luminosity that is in reasonable agreement with estimates based on\nthe theoretical mass transfer rate. Around 40 min the lower bound on the\ntime-averaged luminosity is similar to the luminosity based on the theoretical\nmass transfer rate, suggesting these sources are indeed faint when not\ndetected. Above 50 min some systems are much brighter than the theoretical mass\ntransfer rate predicts, unless these systems have helium burning donors or lose\nadditional angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 17:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-02"}

Moreover, the exchange quantities lack certain symmetry. By\ngeneralizing the traditional concept to also include their time-dependent\nirreversible components allows us to express the first law in a symmetric form\ndE(t)= dQ(t)-dW(t) in which dQ(t) and work dW(t) appear on an equal footing and\npossess the symmetry. We prove that irreversible work turns into irreversible\nheat. Statistical analysis in terms of microstate probabilities p_{i}(t)\nuniquely identifies dW(t) as isentropic and dQ(t) as isometric (see text)\nchange in dE(t); such a clear separation does not occur for exchange\nquantities. Hence, our new formulation of the first law provides tremendous\nadvantages and results in an extremely useful formulation of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics, as we have shown recently.

The NRT non-linear equation admits\nplane wave-like solutions ($q$-plane waves) compatible with the celebrated de\nBroglie relations connecting wave number and frequency, respectively, with\nenergy and momentum. The NRT equation, inspired in the $q$-generalized\nthermostatistical formalism, is characterized by a parameter $q$, and in the\nlimit $q \\to 1$ reduces to the standard, linear Schr\\\"odinger equation. The\n$q$-Gaussian solutions to the NRT equation investigated here admit as a\nparticular instance the previously known $q$-plane wave solutions. The present\nwork thus extends the range of possible processes yielded by the NRT dynamics\nthat admit an analytical, exact treatment. In the $q \\to 1$ limit the\n$q$-Gaussian solutions correspond to the Gaussian wave packet solutions to the\nfree particle linear Schr\\\"odinger equation.

This general paradigm is\ninvestigated in this paper by studying the effects of such violations within\nthe Coleman-Glashow model in which each particle species may have its own\nmaximum attainable velocity, even exceeding that of light \\textit{in vacuo}.\nThe particular focus here is that the muon neutrino may have the maximum speed\nexceeding that of light.

We provide a transparent analytical\nderivation of the spectral intensities of muon neutrinos and muons generated in\nthe Earth's atmosphere by cosmic rays. In this derivation we not only account\nfor elongation of the pion lifetime, but also for the loss of energy by the\nneutrinos by radiation of the electron-positron pairs through the Cohen-Glashow\nprocess, during their propagation. We then compare the theoretical spectra with\nobservations of neutrinos and muons from large instruments like IceCube and\nBUST to set a limit of $\\sim10^{-13}$ on the fractional excess speed of\nneutrinos over that of light. We also show that the ratio of the spectral\nintensities of downward and upward moving neutrinos at various angles\nconstitute a diagnostic exclusively for the Cohen-Glashow process, which may be\nsearched for in the IceCube data set.

Unlike higher ionisation species, hydrogen is an efficient line emitter\nfor a very wide range of photoionisation conditions, and the observed line\nratios depend strongly on the density and photoionisation state of the gas\npresent. A locally optimally emitting cloud model of the broad emission line\nregion was compared to measured emission lines of four nearby ($z\\approx0.2$)\nquasars that have optical and NIR spectra of sufficient signal-to-noise to\nmeasure their Paschen lines. The model provides a good fit to three of the\nobjects, and a fair fit to the fourth object, a ULIRG. We find that low\nincident ionising fluxes ($\\phih<10^{18}$\\cmsqs), and high gas densities\n($\\nh>10^{12}$\\cmcu) are required to reproduce the observed hydrogen emission\nline ratios. This analysis demonstrates that the use of composite spectra in\nphotoionisation modelling is inappropriate; models must be fitted to the\nindividual spectra of quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 19:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The observed Ly-alpha\nemission line strength - quantified by its restframe equivalent width (EW) -\nprovides a valuable diagnostic of stellar populations and dust in galaxies\nduring and after the EoR. In this paper we quantify the effects of star\nformation stochasticity on the predicted Ly-alpha EW in dwarf galaxies, using\nthe publicly available code SLUG ('Stochastically Light Up Galaxies'). We\ncompute the number of hydrogen ionizing photons, as well as flux in the Far UV\nfor a set of models with star formation rates (SFR) in the range 10-3-1\nMsol/yr. From these fluxes we compute the luminosity, L-alpha, and the EW of\nthe Ly-alpha line. We find that stochasticity alone induces a broad\ndistribution in L-alpha and EW at a fixed SFR, and that the widths of these\ndistributions decrease with increasing SFR. We parameterize the EW probability\ndensity function (PDF) as an SFR-dependent double power law. We find that it is\npossible to have EW as low as ~EW0/4 and as high as ~3 times the EW0, where EW0\ndenotes the expected EW in the absence of stochasticity. We argue that\nstochasticity may therefore be important when linking drop-out and narrow-band\nselected galaxies, when identifying population III galaxies, and that it may\nhelp to explain the large EW (EW > 100 - 200 A) observed for a fraction of\nLy-alpha- selected galaxies. Finally, we show that stochasticity can also\naffect the inferred escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies. In\nparticular, we argue that stochasticity may simultaneously explain the observed\nanomalous ratios of the Lyman continuum flux density to the (non-ionizing) UV\ncontinuum density in so-called Lyman-Bump galaxies at z = 3.1, as well as the\nabsence of such objects among a sample of z = 1.3 drop-out galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 19:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 00:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We define a function on the manifold which is the\nexpectation of fitness over the sampling distribution, and regard the goal of\nupdate of the parameters of sampling distribution in the CMA-ES as maximization\nof the expected fitness. We investigate the steepest ascent learning for the\nexpected fitness maximization, where the steepest ascent direction is given by\nthe natural gradient, which is the product of the inverse of the Fisher\ninformation matrix and the conventional gradient of the function.\n  Our first result is that we can obtain under some types of parameterization\nof multivariate normal distribution the natural gradient of the expected\nfitness without the need for inversion of the Fisher information matrix.

Our analysis is based on a spectral\ndecomposition technique which allows us to isolate the microlensed fraction of\nthe flux independently of a detailed modeling of the quasar emission lines.\nUsing this technique, we detect microlensing of the continuum in 85% of the\nsystems. Among them, 80% show microlensing of the broad emission lines.\nFocusing on the most common lines in our spectra (CIII] and MgII) we detect\nmicrolensing of either the blue or the red wing, or of both wings with the same\namplitude. This observation implies that the broad line region is not in\ngeneral spherically symmetric. In addition, the frequent detection of\nmicrolensing of the blue and red wings independently but not simultaneously\nwith a different amplitude, does not support existing microlensing simulations\nof a biconical outflow. Our analysis also provides the intrinsic flux ratio\nbetween the lensed images and the magnitude of the microlensing affecting the\ncontinuum.

These constraints imply that the volume ionized fraction\nof the IGM becomes less than unity at z>7, consistent with a number of\ncomplementary reionization probes.

Here we summarize the science case feasible for a survey of\nSubaru 300 nights. We describe plans to constrain the nature of dark energy via\na survey of emission line galaxies spanning a comoving volume of 9.3 (Gpc/h)^3\nin the redshift range 0.8<z<2.4. In each of 6 redshift bins, the cosmological\ndistances will be measured to 3% precision via BAO, and redshift-space\ndistortions will be used to constrain structure growth to 6% precision. In the\nGA program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way\nand M31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies\nand the structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for 10^6\nstars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo and tidal streams as faint as V~22,\nincluding stars with V < 20 to complement the goals of the Gaia mission. A\nmedium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to be implemented in the red arm will\nallow the measurement of multiple alpha-element abundances and more precise\nvelocities for Galactic stars, elucidating the detailed chemo-dynamical\nstructure and evolution of each of the main stellar components of the Milky Way\nGalaxy and of its dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

However, this\ntheory is inconsistent with optical/UV spectral, variability, and gravitational\nmicrolensing observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the supermassive\nanalogs of BHBs. An inhomogeneous disc (ID) model with large (~0.4 dex)\ntemperature fluctuations in each radial annulus can qualitatively explain all\nof these AGN observations.

The optical light curve of some SNe may be powered by the outward\ndiffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock in optically thick\ncircumstellar matter (CSM). Recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediated\nand -dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into a\ncollisionless shock and can produce hard X-rays. The X-rays are expected to\npeak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. Here we report on a\nsearch, using Swift and Chandra, for X-ray emission from 28 SNe that belong to\nclasses whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense CSM\n(IIn/Ibn/SLSN-I). Two SNe in our sample have X-ray properties that are roughly\nconsistent with the expectation for X-rays from a collisionless shock in\noptically thick CSM. Therefore, we suggest that their optical light curves are\npowered by shock breakout in CSM. We show that two other events were too X-ray\nbright during the SN maximum optical light to be explained by the shock\nbreakout model.

Unlike their vector\ncounterparts, the photini can acquire weak-scale masses from soft SUSY breaking\nand lead to observable signatures at the LHC through mass mixing with the bino.\nIn this work we investigate the collider consequences of adding photini to the\nneutralino sector of the MSSM. Relatively large mixing of one or more photini\nwith the bino can lead to prompt decays of the lightest ordinary supersymmetric\nparticle; these extra cascades transfer most of the energy of SUSY decay chains\ninto Standard Model particles, diminishing the power of missing energy as an\nexperimental handle for signal discrimination. We demonstrate that the missing\nenergy in SUSY events with photini is reduced dramatically for supersymmetric\nspectra with MSSM neutralinos near the weak scale, and study the effects on\nlimits set by the leading hadronic SUSY searches at ATLAS and CMS.

Using 3 seasons of UKIRT observations spanning 1.5 years,\nwe obtained high-quality photometry on 9,200 stars down to J=17 mag, with\nphotometric uncertainty better than 0.04 mag. On the basis of near-infrared\nexcesses from disks, we identify 30 pre-main sequence stars, including 24 which\nare newly discovered. We analyze those stars and find the NIR excesses are\nsignificantly variable.\n  All 9,200 stars were monitored for photometric variability; among the field\nstar population, about 160 exhibited near-infrared variability (1.7% of the\nsample). Of the 30 YSOs (young stellar objects), 28 of them (93%) are variable\nat a significant level. 25 of the 30 YSOs have near-infrared excess consistent\nwith simple disk-plus-star classical T Tauri models. Nine of these (36%) drift\nin color space over the course of these observations and/or since 2MASS\nobservations such that they cross the boundary defining the NIR excess\ncriteria; effectively, they have a transient near-infrared excess. About half\nof the YSOs have color-space variations parallel to either the classical T\nTauri star locus or a hybrid track which includes the dust reddening\ntrajectory. This indicates that the NIR variability in YSOs that possess\naccretion disks arises from a combination of variable extinction and changes in\nthe inner accretion disk: either in accretion rate, central hole size and/or\nthe inclination of the inner disk. While some variability may be due to stellar\nrotation, the level of variability on the individual stars can exceed a\nmagnitude. This is a strong empirical suggestion that protoplanetary disks are\nquite dynamic and exhibit more complex activity on short timescales than is\nattributable to rotation alone or captured in static disk models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 20:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We first construct a one-zone model for a single\nstar-forming galaxy, assuming supernovae power the acceleration of cosmic rays.\nThe same IC interactions leading to gamma rays also substantially contribute to\nthe energy loss of the high-energy cosmic-ray electrons. Consequently, a\ngalaxy's IC emission is determined by the relative importance of IC losses in\nthe cosmic-ray electron energy budget (\"partial calorimetry\"). We use our\ntemplate for galactic IC luminosity to find the cosmological contribution of\nstar-forming galaxies to the EGB. For all of our models, we find the IC EGB\ncontribution is almost an order of magnitude less than the peak of the emission\ndue to cosmic-ray ion interactions (mostly pionic p_cr p_ism \\rightarrow \\pi_0\n\\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma); even at the highest Fermi energies, IC is\nsubdominant. Moreover, the flatter IC spectrum increases the high-energy signal\nof the pionic+IC sum, bringing it into better agreement with the EGB spectral\nindex observed by Fermi .

However, the study of LLAGN is a complex task due to the\ncontribution of the host galaxy, which light swamps these faint nuclei. This is\nspecially critical in the IR range, at the maximum of the torus emission, due\nto the contribution of the old stellar population and/or dust in the nuclear\nregion. Adaptive optics imaging in the NIR (VLT/NaCo) together with diffraction\nlimited imaging in the mid-IR (VLT/VISIR) permit us to isolate the nuclear\nemission for some of the nearest LLAGNs in the Southern Hemisphere.

The Aquarius stream stars also lie on the distinct [Na/Fe] - [O/Fe] and\n[Mg/Fe] - [Al/Fe] relations delineated by Galactic globular cluster stars.\nSpectroscopic parameters for the six Aquarius stars show that they are tightly\nconfined to a 12 Gyr, [Fe/H] = -1.0, alpha-enhanced isochrone, consistent with\ntheir identification as globular cluster debris. We present evidence that the\nAquarius stream may continue through the disk and out into the northern halo.\nOur results indicate a globular cluster origin for the Aquarius stream, and\ndemonstrate the potential for chemical tagging to identify the origins of\nGalactic substructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 22:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Our cherished notions of\ncomputation and information are grounded in classical mechanics, but the\nphysics underlying our world is quantum. In the early 80s researchers began to\nask how computation would change if we adopted a quantum mechanical, instead of\na classical mechanical, view of computation. Slowly, a new picture of\ncomputation arose, one that gave rise to a variety of faster algorithms, novel\ncryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of communication. Small\nquantum information processing devices have been built, and efforts are\nunderway to build larger ones. Even apart from the existence of these devices,\nthe quantum view on information processing has provided significant insight\ninto the nature of computation and information, and a deeper understanding of\nthe physics of our universe and its connections with computation.\n  We start by describing aspects of quantum mechanics that are at the heart of\na quantum view of information processing. We give our own idiosyncratic view of\na number of these topics in the hopes of correcting common misconceptions and\nhighlighting aspects that are often overlooked. A number of the phenomena\ndescribed were initially viewed as oddities of quantum mechanics. It was\nquantum information processing, first quantum cryptography and then, more\ndramatically, quantum computing, that turned the tables and showed that these\noddities could be put to practical effect. It is these application we describe\nnext. We conclude with a section describing some of the many questions left for\nfuture work, especially the mysteries surrounding where the power of quantum\ninformation ultimately comes from.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 22:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 21:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

Quantum phenomena prove to be\nattractive for physical RNGs due to their fundamental randomness and immunity\nto attack [1]- [5]. Optical parametric down conversion is an essential element\nin most quantum optical experiments including optical squeezing [9], and\ngeneration of entangled photons [10]. In an optical parametric oscillator\n(OPO), photons generated through spontaneous down conversion of the pump\ninitiate the oscillation in the absence of other inputs [11, 12]. This quantum\nprocess is the dominant effect during the oscillation build-up, leading to\nselection of one of the two possible phase states above threshold in a\ndegenerate OPO [13]. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel all-optical\nquantum RNG in which the photodetection is not a part of the random process,\nand no post processing is required for the generated bit sequence. We implement\na synchronously pumped twin degenerate OPO, which comprises two identical\nindependent OPOs in a single cavity, and measure the relative phase states of\nthe OPO outputs above threshold as a bit value.

We consider asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, type II\nsupernovae (SNe II) and the dust mass growth in the ISM as the sources of dust,\nand SN shocks as the destruction mechanism of dust. Further, to describe the\ndust evolution precisely, our model takes into account the age and metallicity\n(the ratio of metal mass to ISM mass) dependence of the sources of dust. We\nparticularly focused on the dust mass growth, and found that the dust mass\ngrowth in the ISM is regulated by the metallicity. To quantify this aspect, we\nintroduce a \"critical metallicity\", which is a metallicity at which the\ncontribution of stars (AGB stars and SNe II) equals that of the dust mass\ngrowth in the ISM. If the star formation timescale is shorter, the value of the\ncritical metallicity is higher, but the galactic age at which the metallicity\nreaches the critical metallicity is shorter. From observations, it was expected\nthat the dust mass growth was the dominant source of dust in the Milky Way and\ndusty QSOs at high redshifts. By introducing the critical metallicity, it is\nclearly shown that the dust mass growth is the main source of dust in such\ngalaxies with various star formation timescales and ages. The dust mass growth\nin the ISM is regulated by metallicity, and we stress that the critical\nmetallicity works as an indicator to judge whether the grain growth in the ISM\nis dominant source of dust in a galaxy, especially because of the strong and\nnonlinear dependence on the metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 04:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Our algorithms are as\nefficient as OMP, and improve on the best-known results for missing and noisy\ndata in regression, both in the high-dimensional setting where we seek to\nrecover a sparse vector from only a few measurements, and in the classical\nlow-dimensional setting where we recover an unstructured regressor. In the\nhigh-dimensional setting, our support-recovery algorithm requires no knowledge\nof even the statistics of the noise. Along the way, we also obtain improved\nperformance guarantees for OMP for the standard sparse regression problem with\nGaussian noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 05:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 18:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

It is concluded that the HRG model can very well\nreproduce the results of the lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) of $\\partial\np/\\partial \\epsilon$ and $s/c_v$, especially at finite chemical potential. In\nlight of this, energy fluctuations and other collective phenomena associated\nwith the specific heat might be present in the HRG model.

For shallow\nquenches, the selected wavelength is precisely that of the crystalline phase\nand so well-ordered crystalline states are formed. However, when the system is\ndeeply quenched, we find that this wavelength can be quite different from that\nof the crystal, so that the solidification front naturally generates disorder\nin the system.

For defining\ninertial mass of a particle we need to know its acceleration under some force\nin an inertial reference frame, which itself is defined by the motion of its\nbackground objects. Therefore, the inertial mass of a particle is not\ncompletely its intrinsic property and depends on the position of the particle\nitself and and all other particles (which we refer as background) in the\nuniverse. But the background of a particle keeps on fluctuating randomly due to\ndifferent physical phenomenon in the universe. Therefore, the exact position or\nthe mass of a particle can not be determined at any time, without having full\ninformation about all the other particles in the universe. Hence, in this\npaper, we define the dynamics of a particle statistically. We show that the\nfluctuations in the background of an object contributes to an extra energy term\nin the total energy of the particle.

Under the torque applied by\nthe oscillating walls of the the TO these \"masses\" move relative to each other,\ngenerating measurable dissipation at their interface. We studied this\ndissipation between 0.5K and 1.8K in solid samples grown from commercially pure\n$^4$He and from a 100 ppm $^3$He-$^4$He mixture. The data were analyzed by\nmodelling the TO as a driven harmonic oscillator. In this model, analysis of\nthe resonant frequency and amplitude of the TO yields the temperature\ndependence of the friction coefficient. By fitting the data to specific forms,\nwe found that over our temperature range, the dominant friction mechanism\nassociated with the interfacial motion results from climb of individual\ndislocations. The characteristic energy scale associated with this internal\nfriction is between 3K and 6K, depending on the sample. The fact that a single\nvalue of this energy accounts for the data of a given sample supports the idea\nthat the interface between the moving and static solid is well oriented.

We also discovered, in\neach of the cases, a Diophantine equation involving $N$ and the (necessarily\nrational) number $s = a/c$ that has solutions if there is a tiling using tile\n$T$ of some $ABC$ not similar to $T$. By means of these Diophantine equations,\nsome conclusions about the possible values of $N$ are drawn; in particular\nthere are no tilings possible for values of $N$ of certain forms. We prove, for\nexample, that there is no $N$-tiling with $N$ prime when $3\\alpha + 2\\beta =\n\\pi$. These equations also imply that for each $N$, there is a finite set of\npossibilities for the tile $(a,b,c)$ and the triangle $ABC$. (Usually, but not\nalways, there is just one possible tile.) These equations provide necessary,\nand in three of the five cases sufficient, conditions for the existence of\n$N$-tilings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 01:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 00:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 17:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

We wish to understand possible\ntilings by completely characterizing the triples (ABC, T, N) such that ABC can\nbe N -tiled by T. In particular, this understanding should enable us to specify\nfor which N there exists a tile T and a triangle ABC that is N-tiled by T; or\ngiven N, determine which tiles and triangles can be used for N-tilings; or\ngiven ABC, to determine which tiles and N can be used to N-tile ABC. This is\nthe second of four papers on this subject. In the first paper, we dealt with\nthe case when ABC is similar to T, and the case when T is a right triangle. In\nthis paper, we assume that ABC is not similar to T, and T is not a right\ntriangle, and furthermore that if T has a 120 degree angle, then T is\nisosceles.\n  Under those hypotheses, there are only two families of tilings. There are\ntilings of an equilateral triangle ABC by an isosceles tile with base angles 30\ndegrees, and there are newly-discovered \"triquadratic tilings\", which are\ntreated in the third paper in this series. These arise in the special case that\n3\\alpha + 2\\beta = \\pi or 3\\beta+ 2\\alpha = \\pi with \\alpha not a rational\nmultiple of \\pi, where \\alpha and \\beta are the two smallest angles of the\ntile, and the sides of the tile have rational ratios.\n  The case when the tile has a 120 degree angle and is not isosceles is taken\nup in a subsequent paper.\n  We use techniques from linear algebra and elementary field theory, and in one\ncase we use some algebraic number theory. We use some counting arguments and\nsome elementary geometry and trigonometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 01:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

The\ntriangle T is the \"tile'\".\n  The tile may or may not be similar to ABC . This paper is the first of\nseveral papers, which together seek a complete characterization of the triples\n(ABC,N,T) such that ABC can be N -tiled by T . In this paper, we consider the\ncase in which the tile is similar to ABC, the case in which the tile is a right\ntriangle, and the case when ABC is equilateral.\n  We use (only) techniques from linear algebra and elementary field theory, as\nwell as elementary geometry and trigonometry.\n  Our results (in this paper) are as follows: When the tile is similar to ABC,\nwe always have \"quadratic tilings'\" when N is a square. If the tile is similar\nto ABC and is not a right triangle, then N is a square. If N is a sum of two\nsquares, N = e^2 + f^2, then a right triangle with legs e and f can be N -tiled\nby a tile similar to ABC ; these tilings are called \"biquadratic\". If the tile\nand ABC are 30-60-90 triangles, then N can also be three times a square. If T\nis similar to ABC, these are all the possible triples (ABC, T, N) .\n  If the tile is a right triangle, of course it can tile a certain isosceles\ntriangle when N is twice a square, and in some cases when N is six times a\nsquare.\n  Equilateral triangles can be 3-tiled and 6-tiled and hence they can also be\n3n^2 and 6n^2 tiled for any n . We also discovered a family of tilings when N\nis 3 times a square, which we call the \"hexagonal tilings.\" These tilings\nexhaust all the possible triples (ABC, T, N) in case T is a right triangle or\nis similar to ABC . Other cases are treated in subsequent papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 00:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}
