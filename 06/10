The literature now contains various direct\nproofs of this fact and of related sparse approximation results. However, it\nseems quite cumbersome to prove such a canon of results for each system\nseparately, while many of the systems exhibit certain similarities.\n  In this paper, with the introduction of the notion of {\\em parabolic\nmolecules}, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework which includes\ncustomarily employed representation systems based on parabolic scaling such as\ncurvelets and shearlets. It is shown that pairs of parabolic molecules have the\nfundamental property to be almost orthogonal in a particular sense. This result\nis then applied to analyze parabolic molecules with respect to their ability to\nsparsely approximate data governed by anisotropic features. For this, the\nconcept of {\\em sparsity equivalence} is introduced which is shown to allow the\nidentification of a large class of parabolic molecules providing the same\nsparse approximation results as curvelets and shearlets. Finally, as another\napplication, smoothness spaces associated with parabolic molecules are\nintroduced providing a general theoretical approach which even leads to novel\nresults for, for instance, compactly supported shearlets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2012 17:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

The study uses the van\nder Waals density functional method vdW-DF to obtain adsorption energies and\nadsorption structures for these molecules of environmental concern. In this\nstudy chloroform is found to adsorb with the H atom pointing away from\ngraphene, with adsorption energy 357 meV (34.4 kJ/mol). For bromoform the\ncalculated adsorption energy is 404 meV (39.0 kJ/mol). The corrugation of\ngraphene as seen by chloroform is small, the difference in adsorption energy\nalong the graphene plane is less than 6 meV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jun 2012 20:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

However, the extreme tail of the\ndistribution deviates upward even from the power-law fit and exhibits a\ndramatic \"runaway\" behavior.

Subaru Telescope infrared imaging reveals the\npresence of an elliptical and a disk-like galaxy located almost symmetrically\nbetween the quasars, creating a cross-like configuration. Based on absorption\nlines in the quasar spectra and the colors of the galaxies, we estimate that\nboth galaxies are located at redshift $z=0.899$. This, as well as the\nsimilarity of the quasar spectra, suggests that the system is a single quasar\nmultiply imaged by a galaxy group or cluster acting as a gravitational lens,\nalthough the possibility of a binary quasar cannot be fully excluded. We show\nthat the gravitational lensing hypothesis implies these galaxies are not\nisolated, but must be embedded in a dark matter halo of virial mass $\\sim 4\n\\times 10^{14}\\ h_{70}^{-1}\\ {M}_\\odot$ assuming an NFW model with a\nconcentration parameter of $c_{vir}=6$, or a singular isothermal sphere profile\nwith a velocity dispersion of $\\sim 670$ km s$^{-1}$. We place constraints on\nthe location of the dark matter halo, as well as the velocity dispersions of\nthe galaxies. In addition, we discuss the influence of differential reddening,\nmicrolensing and intrinsic variability on the quasar spectra and broadband\nphotometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2012 09:49:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 05:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Numerous schemes for\nentanglement-by-measurement of solid-state qubits have been proposed, but the\ndemanding experimental requirements have so far hindered implementations. Here\nwe realize a two-qubit parity measurement on nuclear spins in diamond by\nexploiting the electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center as readout ancilla.\nThe measurement enables us to project the initially uncorrelated nuclear spins\ninto maximally entangled states. By combining this entanglement with\nhigh-fidelity single-shot readout we demonstrate the first violation of Bells\ninequality with solid-state spins.

More often than not, the actions of some agents are dependent on\nthe previous execution (if not also on the outcome) of the actions of other\nagents. The resulting interdependencies between the timings of the actions of\nthe various agents give rise to the study of methods for timely coordination of\nthese actions.\n  In this work, we formulate and mathematically analyze \"Timely-Coordinated\nResponse\" - a novel multi-agent coordination problem in which the time\ndifference between each pair of actions may be constrained by upper and/or\nlower bounds. This problem generalizes coordination problems previously studied\nby Halpern and Moses and by Ben-Zvi and Moses.\n  We optimally solve timely-coordinated response in two ways: using a\ngeneralization of the fixed-point approach of Halpern and Moses, and using a\ngeneralization of the \"syncausality\" approach of Ben-Zvi and Moses. We\nconstructively show the equivalence of the solutions yielded by both\napproaches, and by combining them, derive strengthened versions of known\nresults for some previously-defined special cases of this problem.\n  Our analysis is conducted under minimal assumptions: we work in a\ncontinuous-time model with possibly infinitely many agents. The general results\nwe obtain for this model reduce to stronger ones for discrete-time models with\nonly finitely many agents. In order to distill the properties of such models\nthat are significant to this reduction, we define several classes of\nnaturally-occurring models, which in a sense separate the different results. We\npresent both a more practical optimal solution, as well as a surprisingly\nsimple condition for solvability, for timely coordinated response under these\nmodels.\n  Finally, we show how our results generalize the results known for\npreviously-studied special cases of this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2012 14:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}
