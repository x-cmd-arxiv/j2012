After defining a characteristic imset polytope (cim-polytope) as the\nconvex hull of all characteristic imsets with a given set of nodes, they also\nshowed that a model selection in graphical models, which maximizes a quality\ncriterion, can be converted into a linear programming problem over the\ncim-polytope.

We prove that spinal codes achieve Shannon capacity for the\nbinary symmetric channel (BSC) and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\nchannel with an efficient polynomial-time encoder and decoder. They are the\nfirst rateless codes with proofs of these properties for BSC and AWGN. The key\nidea in the spinal code is the sequential application of a hash function over\nthe message bits. The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial\nfor efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander\nstructure in good codes, we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential\nstructure, achieves capacity. The pseudo-randomness provided by a hash function\nsuffices for this purpose. Our proof introduces a variant of Gallager's result\ncharacterizing the error exponent of random codes for any memoryless channel.\nWe present a novel application of these error-exponent results within the\nframework of an efficient sequential code.

In GCGWE, we view the players\nas vertices in a weighted graph. The amount of negative impact (e.g.\ncongestion) caused by two close-by players to each other is determined by the\nweight of the edge linking them. The GCGWE unifies and significantly\ngeneralizes several simpler models considered in the previous literature, and\nis well suited for modeling a wide range of networking scenarios. One good\nexample is to use the GCGWE to model spectrum sharing in wireless networks,\nwhere we can properly define the edge weights and payoff functions to capture\nthe rather complicated interference relationship between wireless nodes. By\nidentifying which GCGWEs possess pure Nash equilibria and the very desirable\nfinite improvement property, we gain insight into when spatially distributed\nwireless nodes will be able to self-organize into a mutually acceptable\nresource allocation. We also consider the efficiency of the pure Nash\nequilibria, and the computational complexity of finding them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2012 10:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

During this\nphase, the inflaton typically oscillates at the bottom of its potential and\ngradually transfers its energy to radiation. At the same time, the amplitude of\nthe fields coupled to the inflaton may undergo parametric resonance and, as a\nconsequence, explosive particle production can take place. A priori, these\nphenomena could lead to an amplification of the super-Hubble scale curvature\nperturbations which, in turn, would modify the standard inflationary\npredictions. However, remarkably, it has been shown that, although the\nMukhanov-Sasaki variable does undergo narrow parametric instability during\npreheating, the amplitude of the corresponding super-Hubble curvature\nperturbations remain constant. Therefore, in single field models, metric\npreheating does not affect the power spectrum of the large scale perturbations.\nIn this article, we investigate the corresponding effect on the scalar\nbi-spectrum. Using the Maldacena's formalism, we analytically show that, for\nmodes of cosmological interest, the contributions to the scalar bi-spectrum as\nthe curvature perturbations evolve on super-Hubble scales during preheating is\ncompletely negligible. Specifically, we illustrate that, certain terms in the\nthird order action governing the curvature perturbations which may naively be\nexpected to contribute significantly are exactly canceled by other\ncontributions to the bi-spectrum. We corroborate selected analytical results by\nnumerical investigations. We conclude with a brief discussion of the results we\nhave obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2012 13:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 13:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

Pulse-like\nresponses in the expectation value of position $<x(t)>$ are predicted at $t\n\\approx n\\tau$ ($n=2,3,...$) and are particularly evident at $t \\approx 2\\tau$.\nA novel result of our study is the finding of 'revival echoes'. Revivals (but\nnot echoes) occur even if the second perturbation is absent. In particular, in\nthe absence of the second perturbation, the response to the first perturbation\ndies away, but then reassembles, producing a response at revival times $mT_x$\n($m=1,2,...$).

This paper describes the various components of\nour prototype implementation of a Real-time Passenger Information System\n(RTPIS) for a public transport system like a fleet of buses. Vehicle-mounted\nunits, bus station units and a server located at the transport company premises\ncomprise the system. The vehicle unit reports the current position of the\nvehicle to a central server periodically via General Packet Radio Service\n(GPRS). An Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) algorithm running on the server\npredicts the arrival times of buses at their stops based on real-time\nobservations of the buses' current Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates.\nThis information is displayed and announced to passengers at stops using\nstation units, which periodically fetch the required ETA from the server via\nGPRS. Novel features of our prototype include: (a) a route creator utility\nwhich automatically creates new routes from scratch when a bus is driven along\nthe new route, and (b) voice tagging of stops and points of interest along any\nroute. Besides, the prototype provides: (i) web-based applications for\npassengers, providing useful information like a snapshot of present bus\nlocations on the streets, and (ii) web-based analysis tools for the transport\nauthority, providing information useful for fleet management, like number of\ntrips undertaken by a specific bus. The prototype has been demonstrated in a\ncampus environment, with four-wheelers and two-wheelers emulating buses. The\nautomatic real-time passenger information system has the potential of making\nthe public transport system an attractive alternative for city-dwellers,\nthereby contributing to fewer private vehicles on the road, leading to lower\ncongestion levels and less pollution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2012 13:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

This dataset covers the period since 1870 with continuous\nannual estimates in developed countries. All time series for individual\neconomies have a clear structural break between 1940 and 1950. The behavior\nbefore 1940 and after 1950 can be accurately (R2 from 0.7 to 0.99) approximated\nby linear time trends. The corresponding slopes of regressions lines before and\nafter the break differ by a factor of 4 (Switzerland) to 19 (Spain). We have\nextrapolated the early trends into the second interval and obtained much lower\nestimates of real GDP per capita in 2011: from 2.4 (Switzerland) to 5.0 (Japan)\ntimes smaller than the current levels. When the current linear trends are\nextrapolated into the past, they intercept the zero line between 1908\n(Switzerland) and 1944 (Japan). There is likely an internal conflict between\nthe estimating procedures before 1940 and after 1950. A reasonable explanation\nof the discrepancy is that the GDP deflator in developed countries has been\nhighly underestimated since 1950. In the USA, the GDP deflator is\nunderestimated by a factor of 1.4. This is exactly the ratio of the interest\nrate controlled by the Federal Reserve and the rate of inflation. Hence, the\nFederal Reserve actually retains its interest rate at the level of true price\ninflation when corrected for the bias in the GDP deflator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2012 14:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

Weak frameworks in spherical and\ncylindrical systems were then created. Next, using rotational matrices to\nchange the position and direction of a simple projection, useful, explicit,\nparametric system of equations were attained in three-dimensional Cartesian\nspace which roughly approximate the structure of a blood platelet.\n  Finally, a methodology to return the drag coefficient ($c_d$) for any\ninputted set of blood platelet images was designed. This method was\nincorporated into a C++ program returning the functional representation and\ndrag coefficient of any given platelet.
