The inclusion of flux terms\nfor the supersymmetric BLG and ABJM theories of closed M2-branes is discussed\nand then generalised to open M2-branes. Here the boundary condition is derived\nand different BPS configurations are examined where we find a mass deformed\nBasu-Harvey equation for the M2-M5 system. The Lorentzian 3-algebra is then\nemployed for obtaining a theory of D2-branes in a flux background, we then\nobtain the new fuzzy funnel solution of the system of D2-D4 branes in a flux.\nMatrix theories and their compactifications as well as noncommutative geometry\nand noncommutative gauge theories are reviewed with a discussion of their\ngeneralisations to three dimensions to be used to describe the M-theory three\nform potential $C_3$. A new feature of string theory is then obtained called\nthe quantum Nambu geometry (QNG). It is found by considering the action for\nD1-strings in a RR flux background and we demonstrate that there is a large\nflux double scaling limit where the action is dominated by a Chern-Simons-Myers\ncoupling term. A classical solution to this is the quantised spacetime known as\nthe quantum Nambu geometry. Various matrix models are obtained from this\naction, these are the large flux dominated terms of the full actions for the\ncorresponding matrix models. The QNG gives rise to an expansion of D1-strings\nto D4-branes in the IIA theory, so we obtain an action for the large flux terms\nfor this action which is verified by a dimensional reduction of the PST action\ndescribing M5-branes.

One method is based on solving the ray and\nmoment equations using finite differences. The second uses a Monte Carlo\napproach incorporating methods that greatly improve the accuracy compared with\nprevious approaches in this context. Several applications are presented serving\nas test problems for both a static medium and an expanding medium, including\ninhomogeneities in the density and velocity fields. Solutions are obtained in\nthe coherent scattering limit and for Doppler RII redistribution with and\nwithout recoils. We find generally that the radiation intensity is linear in\nthe cosine of the azimuthal angle with respect to radius to high accuracy over\na broad frequency region across the line centre for both linear and perturbed\nvelocity fields, yielding the Eddington factors f(nu) = 1/3 and g(nu) = 3/5. We\nshow the radiation field produced by a point source divides into three spatial\nregimes for a uniformly expanding homogeneous medium: at radii r small compared\nwith a characteristic radius r*, the mean intensity near line centre varies as\n1/ r^(7/3), while at r > r* it approaches 1/ r^2; for r << r* it is modified by\nfrequency redistribution. Before the reionization epoch, r* takes on the\nuniversal value 1.1 Mpc, independent of redshift. The mean intensity and\nscattering rate are found to be very sensitive to the gradient of the velocity\nfield, growing exponentially with the amplitude of the perturbation as the\nlimit of a vanishing velocity gradient is approached near the source. We expect\nthe 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization to thus be a sensitive probe of\nboth the density and the peculiar velocity fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 16:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Therefore,\nif a model with a compressed mass spectrum allows for multi-lepton final\nstates, one could derive constraints using multi-lepton searches.

However, selective sweeps can also quickly\ncarry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise\nearly in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the\ninterplay between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking\nresults in a characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype\nvariation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection\ncoefficient of the sweep. Based on this result, we develop an estimator for the\nselection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel\nvariation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on\npreexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.\nCompared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the\nsize of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator\nrequires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth in order\nto capture low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms\nstandard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the\naccuracy of our estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over\ntime as a consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of\nrecombination, soft sweeps, and demography. As an example for its use, we apply\nour estimator to deep sequencing data from HIV populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 17:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-29"}

Specifically, we consider the response\nof an initial thermal equilibrium state of the theory under variations of the\nbosonic or fermionic mass, to leading order in m/T<<1. When the masses are made\nto vary in time, novel new counterterms must be introduced to renormalize the\nboundary theory. We consider transitions the conformal super-Yang-Mills theory\nto the mass deformed gauge theory and also the reverse transitions. By\nconstruction, these transitions are controlled by a characteristic time scale\n\\calt and we show how the response of the system depends on the ratio of this\ntime scale to the thermal time scale 1/T.

In the non-asymptotic regimes, option prices are described by\nthe Lewis-Lipton formula which allows one to represent them as Fourier\nintegrals; the prices can be trivially expressed in terms of their implied\nvolatility. Recently, attempts at calculating the asymptotic limits of the\nimplied volatility have yielded several expressions for the short-time,\nlong-time, and wing asymptotics. In order to study the volatility surface in\nrequired detail, in this paper we use the FX conventions and describe the\nimplied volatility as a function of the Black-Scholes delta. Surprisingly, this\nconvention is closely related to the resolution of singularities frequently\nused in algebraic geometry. In this framework, we survey the literature,\nreformulate some known facts regarding the asymptotic behavior of the implied\nvolatility, and present several new results. We emphasize the role of\nfractional differentiation in studying the tempered stable exponential Levy\nprocesses and derive novel numerical methods based on judicial\nfinite-difference approximations for fractional derivatives. We also briefly\ndemonstrate how to extend our results in order to study important cases of\nlocal and stochastic volatility models, whose close relation to the L\\'evy\nprocess based models is particularly clear when the Lewis-Lipton formula is\nused. Our main conclusion is that studying asymptotic properties of the implied\nvolatility, while theoretically exciting, is not always practically useful\nbecause the domain of validity of many asymptotic expressions is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 18:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-29"}

Unlike other\nGalactic Type Ia supernova remnants such as Tycho and SN 1006, and SNR\n0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, Kepler shows evidence for a strong\ncircumstellar interaction.

Using models that\ncontain either 0.3 M_sun (subenergetic) or 1 M_sun (energetic) of 56Ni, we\nsimulate the interaction between supernova Ia ejecta and various circumstellar\ndensity models.

The universal generating function (UGF) technique is used\nfor the individual component multi-state modeling. A multiplication-type\ncomposition operator is introduced to combine the UGFs for the mechanical\ndegradation and renewable generation source states into the UGF of the\nrenewable generator power output. The overall multi-state DG system UGF is then\nconstructed and classical reliability indices (e.g. loss of load expectation\n(LOLE), expected energy not supplied (EENS)) are computed from the DG system\ngeneration and load UGFs.

We obtain\nimproved estimates for HD 189733b's dayside planet-star flux ratio of 0.1466%\n+/- 0.0040% at 3.6 micron and 0.1787% +/- 0.0038% at 4.5 micron; these are the\nmost accurate secondary eclipse depths obtained to date for an extrasolar\nplanet. We compare our new dayside and nightside spectra for HD 189733b to the\npredictions of models from Burrows et al. (2008) and Showman et al. (2009). We\nfind that HD 189733b's 4.5 micron nightside flux is 3.3 sigma smaller than\npredicted by the Showman et al. models, which assume that the chemistry is in\nlocal thermal equilibrium. We conclude that this discrepancy is best-explained\nby vertical mixing, which should lead to an excess of CO and correspondingly\nenhanced 4.5 micron absorption in this region.

For a given choice of\ncosmological parameters, this model can be used to predict the galaxy\nluminosity function, as well as the two-point correlation functions of\ngalaxies, and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, both as function of scale and\nluminosity. In this paper, the first in a series, we present the detailed,\nanalytical model, which we test against mock galaxy redshift surveys\nconstructed from high-resolution numerical $N$-body simulations. We demonstrate\nthat our model, which includes scale-dependence of the halo bias and a proper\ntreatment of halo exclusion, reproduces the 3-dimensional galaxy-galaxy\ncorrelation and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation (which can be projected to\npredict the observables) with an accuracy better than 10 (in most cases 5)\npercent. Ignoring either of these effects, as is often done, results in\nsystematic errors that easily exceed 40 percent on scales of $\\sim 1\nh^{-1}\\Mpc$, where the data is typically most accurate.

Encouragement for our study came from sky background measurements on the\nhigh Antarctic glacial plateau in winter that showed markedly lower NIR\nemission when compared to good mid-latitude astronomical sites due to reduced\nemission from OH airglow lines.

The\nfunctional method in question has its roots in the exact renormalisation group\nflow techniques pioneered by Wilson, but with the flow parameter not limited to\nthe familiar momentum cutoff. Finding a configuration satisfying an expression\nfor the exact effective action which does not vary with this parameter provides\nthe basis for finding solutions to the physical actions we study. Firstly, the\nmethod is applied to an expression for the bare action of the pseudo-scalar\naxion used to explain the strong CP problem in QCD. When quantized, we find\nthat the effective potential of the axion, when interactions are not\nconsidered, is necessarily flattened by spinodal instability effects. We regard\nthis flattening asrepresenting the very early stage in the development of the\naxion potential, when the Peccei-Quinn U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken\nresulting in a double-well potential. Using commonly quoted values for the\nparameters of such a potential, we devise an expression for the energy density\nof the emerging axion potential and this is compared to dark energy. We then\napply the functional method to the bosonic string with time varying graviton,\ndilaton and antisymmetric tensor (resulting in the string-axion) background\nfields. We achieve a demonstration of conformal invariance in a\nnon-perturbative manner in the beta functions, contrasting with conventional\nstring cosmology where cancellation of a perturbative expansion is performed.\nWe then offer some hints as to possible cosmological implications of our\nconfiguration in terms of optical anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 21:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-20"}

Using different centrality measures, we\ncan also determine the relative importance of each player in the game, the\n`popularity' of a player, and the effect of removing players from the game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 21:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

In\nthis overview I will focus on HI 21-cm spectral line source detection in\nextragalactic surveys, in particular HIPASS, the \"HI Parkes All-Sky Survey\" and\nWALLABY, the \"ASKAP HI All-Sky Survey\". I use the original HIPASS data to\nhighlight the diversity of spectral signatures of galaxies and gaseous clouds,\nboth in emission and absorption.

Issues such as\nsource confusion and baseline ripples, typically encountered in single-dish HI\nsurveys, are much reduced in interferometric HI surveys.

To address\nthis shortcoming, we propose a new biclustering procedure based on profile\nlikelihood. The procedure applies to a broad range of data modalities,\nincluding binary, count, and continuous observations. We prove that the\nprocedure recovers the true row and column classes when the dimensions of the\ndata matrix tend to infinity, even if the functional form of the data\ndistribution is misspecified. The procedure requires computing a combinatorial\nsearch, which can be expensive in practice.

Combining our data\nwith literature results produces a compilation of some 68 chemical abundance\nmeasurements in 49 unique clusters. For this combined sample, we study the\nchemical abundances of open clusters as a function of distance, age, and\nmetallicity. We confirm that the metallicity gradient in the outer disk is\nflatter than the gradient in the vicinity of the solar neighborhood. We also\nconfirm that the open clusters in the outer disk are metal-poor with\nenhancements in the ratios [alpha/Fe] and perhaps [Eu/Fe]. All elements show\nnegligible or small trends between [X/Fe] and distance (< 0.02 dex/kpc), but\nfor some elements, there is a hint that the local (RGC < 13 kpc) and distant\n(RGC > 13 kpc) samples may have different trends with distance. There is no\nevidence for significant abundance trends versus age (< 0.04 dex/Gyr). We\nmeasure the linear relation between [X/Fe] and metallicity, [Fe/H], and find\nthat the scatter about the mean trend is comparable to the measurement\nuncertainties. Comparison with solar neighborhood field giants shows that the\nopen clusters share similar abundance ratios [X/Fe] at a given metallicity.\nWhile the flattening of the metallicity gradient and enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios\nin the outer disk suggest a different chemical enrichment history to the solar\nneighborhood, we echo the sentiments expressed by Friel et al. that definitive\nconclusions await homogeneous analyses of larger samples of stars in larger\nnumbers of clusters.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 06:17:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 01:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 16:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-29"}

As more and\nmore studies are carried out with observational rather than well controlled\nexperimental samples, it becomes important to evaluate and properly control the\nimpact of sample heterogeneity on DE gene finding. Typical methods for\nidentifying DE genes require ranking all the genes according to a preselected\nstatistic based on a single model for two or more group comparisons, with or\nwithout adjustment for other covariates. Such single model approaches\nunavoidably result in model misspecification, which can lead to increased error\ndue to bias for some genes and reduced efficiency for the others.

To properly\ncontrol for sample heterogeneity and to provide a flexible and coherent\nframework for identifying simultaneously DE genes associated with a single or\nmultiple sample characteristics and/or their interactions, we proposed a\nBayesian model averaging approach which corrects the model misspecification by\naveraging over model space formed by all relevant covariates.

By combining the accurately calibrated photometry with\nthe spectroscopic metallicity distributions of individual Red Giant Branch\nstars we obtain the detailed star formation and chemical evolution history of\nFornax. Fornax is dominated by intermediate age (1-10 Gyr) stellar populations,\nbut also includes ancient (10-14 Gyr), and young (<1 Gyr) stars. We show that\nFornax displays a radial age gradient, with younger, more metal-rich\npopulations dominating the central region. This confirms results from previous\nworks. Within an elliptical radius of 0.8 degrees, or 1.9 kpc from the centre,\na total mass in stars of 4.3x10^7 Msun was formed, from the earliest times\nuntil 250 Myr ago. Using the detailed star formation history, age estimates are\ndetermined for individual stars on the upper RGB, for which spectroscopic\nabundances are available, giving an age-metallicity relation of the Fornax dSph\nfrom individual stars. This shows that the average metallicity of Fornax went\nup rapidly from [Fe/H]<-2.5 dex to [Fe/H]=-1.5 dex between 8-12 Gyr ago, after\nwhich a more gradual enrichment resulted in a narrow, well-defined sequence\nwhich reaches [Fe/H]\\sim-0.8 dex, \\sim3 Gyr ago.

(2011), we investigate the contributions\nfrom the Kuiper Belt objects (KBO) to the WMAP ILC 7 map, whereby we can\nminimize the contrast in power between even and odd multipoles in the CMB,\ndiscussed discussed by Kim & Naselsky (2010). We submit our KBO de-correlated\nCMB signal to several tests, to analyze its validity, and find that\nincorporation of the KBO emission can decrease the quadrupole-octupole\nalignment and parity asymmetry problems, provided that the KBO signals has a\nnon-cosmological dipole modulation, associated with the statistical anisotropy\nof the ILC 7 map. Additionally, we show that the amplitude of the dipole\nmodulation, within a 2 sigma interval, is in agreement with the corresponding\namplitudes, discussed by Lew (2008).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 10:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2012 13:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-01"}

While star formation\nrates and the merger history are now measured with increasingly high certainty,\nthe role of gas accretion from the intergalactic medium in supplying gas for\nstar formation still remains largely unknown. We present in this paper indirect\nevidence for the accretion of gas into massive galaxies with initial stellar\nmasses M_*>10^{11} M_sol and following the same merger adjusted co-moving\nnumber density at lower redshifts during the epoch 1.5 < z < 3, using results\nfrom the GOODS NICMOS Survey (GNS).

We further demonstrate that\nthis additional gas mass cannot be accounted for by cold gas delivered through\nminor and major mergers. We also consider the effects of gas outflows and gas\nrecycling due to stellar evolution in these calculations. We argue that to\nsustain star formation at the observed rates there must be additional methods\nfor increasing the cold gas mass, and that the likeliest method for\nestablishing this supply of gas is by accretion from the intergalactic medium.\nWe calculate that the average gas mass accretion rate into these massive\ngalaxies between 1.5 < z < 3.0, is \\dot{M} = 96+/-19 M_sol/yr after accounting\nfor outflowing gas.

One such\nreduction gives a Toda system, for which we find a new type of nonabelian\nvortex. Another gives the standard Abelian-Higgs model, thereby allowing us to\nembed all the usual (multi-)vortex solutions of the latter into the ABJM model.\nBy turning off the mass deformation at the level of the reduced model, we can\nalso continuously deform to the massive $\\phi^4$ theory in the massless ABJM\ncase. In this way we can embed the Landau-Ginzburg model into the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence as a consistent truncation of ABJM. In this context, the mass\ndeformation parameter $\\mu$ and a field VEV $<\\phi>$ act as $g$ and $g_c$\nrespectively, leading to a well-motivated AdS/CMT construction from string\ntheory.

The main feature of the novel approach\nis a considerable reduction in the control parameters and a consequent gain in\ncomputational speed. Each spiral is built by using a predefined pattern for\nthrust direction and switching structure. The pattern is then optimised to\nminimise propellant consumption and transfer time. The variation of the orbital\nelements due to the thrust is computed analytically from a first-order solution\nof the perturbed Keplerian motion. The proposed approach allows for a realistic\nestimation of {\\Delta}V and time of flight required to transfer a spacecraft\nbetween two arbitrary orbits. Eccentricity and plane changes are both accounted\nfor. The novel approach is applied here to the design of missions for the\nremoval of space debris by means of an Ion Beam Shepherd Spacecraft. In\nparticular, two slightly different variants of the proposed low-thrust control\nmodel are used for the different phases of the mission. Thanks to their low\ncomputational cost they can be included in a multiobjective optimisation\nproblem in which the sequence and timing of the removal of five pieces of\ndebris are optimised to minimise propellant consumption and mission duration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2012 10:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}
