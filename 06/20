The highest end-to-end\nsum rates are achieved when the relays are jointly optimized with the transmit\nstrategy. Unfortunately, interference couples the links together making joint\noptimization challenging. Further, the end-to-end multi-hop performance is\nsensitive to rate mismatch, when some links have a dominant first link while\nothers have a dominant second link. This paper proposes an algorithm for\ndesigning the linear transmit precoders at the transmitters and relays of the\nrelay interference broadcast channel, a generic model for relay-based cellular\nsystems, to maximize the end-to-end sum-rates. First, the relays are designed\nto maximize the second-hop sum-rates. Next, approximate end-to-end rates that\ndepend on the time-sharing fraction and the second-hop rates are used to\nformulate a sum-utility maximization problem for designing the transmitters.\nThis problem is solved by iteratively minimizing the weighted sum of mean\nsquare errors. Finally, the norms of the transmit precoders at the transmitters\nare adjusted to eliminate rate mismatch. The proposed algorithm allows for\ndistributed implementation and has fast convergence. Numerical results show\nthat the proposed algorithm outperforms a reasonable application of single-hop\ninterference management strategies separately on two hops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 17:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 22:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Note that this sample is not volume-complete but\nvolume-limited, and, thus, there is incompleteness in our reported companion\nrates. We are sensitive to common proper motion companions with separations\nfrom roughly 200 AU to 10,000 AU (~10\" -> ~10'). From 77 sources followed-up to\ndate, we recover 11 previously known tertiaries, three previously known\ncandidate tertiaries, of which two are spectroscopically confirmed and one\nrejected, and three new candidates, of which two are confirmed and one\nrejected. This yields an estimated wide tertiary fraction of 19.5^+5.2%_-3.7%.\nThis observed fraction is consistent with predictions set out in star formation\nsimulations where the fraction of wide, low-mass companions to spectroscopic\nbinaries is >10%, and is roughly twice the wide companion rate of single stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 18:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However, the remote sensing and in situ data of the same CME cannot be\ndirectly compared. Thus, we use several models to parameterize the two data\nsets. With the model results, we are able to compare the arrival time, Earth\nimpact speed, internal magnetic field, size and orientation as derived from the\nremote sensing and in situ methods. From the derived kinematics, we compare the\npredicted arrival times and impact velocities with the in situ data. We find\nthat even with nearly continuous observations and the best available model of\nthe CME structure, there is still a significant error in the predicted values.\nWe estimate the various forces acting on the CME as predicted by three\ntheoretical models of CME propagation and expansion and compare these results\nwith the observational results. We find that the flux rope model of Chen (1989)\nprovides the best agreement with the observations.

For template\nfitting, we use a Maximum Likelihood (ML) method and a new Hierarchical\nBayesian (HB) method, which learns the prior distribution of template\nprobabilities from the data. SVM requires training data to classify unknown\nsources; ML and HB don't. We consider i.) a best-case scenario (SVM_best) where\nthe training data is (unrealistically) a random sampling of the data in both\nsignal-to-noise and demographics, and ii.) a more realistic scenario where\ntraining is done on higher signal-to-noise data (SVM_real) at brighter apparent\nmagnitudes. Testing with COSMOS ugriz data we find that HB outperforms ML,\ndelivering ~80% completeness, with purity of ~60-90% for both stars and\ngalaxies, respectively. We find no algorithm delivers perfect performance, and\nthat studies of metal-poor main-sequence turnoff stars may be challenged by\npoor star-galaxy separation. Using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve,\nwe find a best-to-worst ranking of SVM_best, HB, ML, and SVM_real. We conclude,\ntherefore, that a well trained SVM will outperform template-fitting methods.\nHowever, a normally trained SVM performs worse. Thus, Hierarchical Bayesian\ntemplate fitting may prove to be the optimal classification method in future\nsurveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 17:31:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 19:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper\nwe generate two new, very large, sets of pMSSM models with sparticle masses\nextending up to 4 TeV, where the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is\neither a neutralino or gravitino. The existence of a gravitino LSP necessitates\na detailed study of its cosmological effects and we find that Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis places strong constraints on this scenario. Both sets are\nsubjected to a global set of theoretical, observational and experimental\nconstraints resulting in a sample of \\sim 225k viable models for each LSP type.\nThe characteristics of these two model sets are briefly compared. We confront\nthe neutralino LSP model set with searches for SUSY at the 7 TeV LHC using both\nthe missing (MET) and non-missing ET ATLAS analyses.

We consider a scenario where the images\ncaptured at different viewpoints are encoded independently using common coding\nsolutions (e.g., JPEG, H.264 intra) with a balanced rate distribution among\ndifferent cameras. A central decoder first estimates the underlying correlation\nmodel from the independently compressed images which will be used for the joint\nsignal recovery. The joint reconstruction is then cast as a constrained convex\noptimization problem that reconstructs total-variation (TV) smooth images that\ncomply with the estimated correlation model. At the same time, we add\nconstraints that force the reconstructed images to be consistent with their\ncompressed versions. We show by experiments that the proposed joint\nreconstruction scheme outperforms independent reconstruction in terms of image\nquality, for a given target bit rate.

This approach can increase ad efficacy for two\nmain reasons: peers' affiliations reflect unobserved consumer characteristics,\nwhich are correlated along the social network; and the inclusion of social cues\n(i.e., peers' association with a brand) alongside ads affect responses via\nsocial influence processes. For these reasons, responses may be increased when\nmultiple social signals are presented with ads, and when ads are affiliated\nwith peers who are strong, rather than weak, ties.\n  We conduct two very large field experiments that identify the effect of\nsocial cues on consumer responses to ads, measured in terms of ad clicks and\nthe formation of connections with the advertised entity. In the first\nexperiment, we randomize the number of social cues present in word-of-mouth\nadvertising, and measure how responses increase as a function of the number of\ncues. The second experiment examines the effect of augmenting traditional ad\nunits with a minimal social cue (i.e., displaying a peer's affiliation below an\nad in light grey text). On average, this cue causes significant increases in ad\nperformance. Using a measurement of tie strength based on the total amount of\ncommunication between subjects and their peers, we show that these influence\neffects are greatest for strong ties.

Resonance bifurcations for heteroclinic\nnetworks are more complicated because different subcycles in the network can\nundergo resonance at different parameter values, but have, until now, not been\nsystematically studied. In this article we present the first investigation of\nresonance bifurcations in heteroclinic networks. Specifically, we study two\nheteroclinic networks in $\\R^4$ and consider the dynamics that occurs as\nvarious subcycles in each network change stability. The two cases are\ndistinguished by whether or not one of the equilibria in the network has real\nor complex contracting eigenvalues. We construct two-dimensional Poincare\nreturn maps and use these to investigate the dynamics of trajectories near the\nnetwork. At least one equilibrium solution in each network has a\ntwo-dimensional unstable manifold, and we use the technique developed in [18]\nto keep track of all trajectories within these manifolds. In the case with real\neigenvalues, we show that the asymptotically stable network loses stability\nfirst when one of two distinguished cycles in the network goes through\nresonance and two or six periodic orbits appear. In the complex case, we show\nthat an infinite number of stable and unstable periodic orbits are created at\nresonance, and these may coexist with a chaotic attractor. There is a further\nresonance, for which the eigenvalue combination is a property of the entire\nnetwork, after which the periodic orbits which originated from the individual\nresonances may interact.

In this case,\nthe rates of convergence are determined by the interaction of four parameters,\nthe smoothness and spatial homogeneity of the unknown function $f$ and degrees\nof ill-posedness and spatial inhomogeneity of operator $Q$. Estimators obtained\nin the paper are based either on wavelet-vaguelette decomposition (if the norms\nof all vaguelettes are finite) or on a hybrid of wavelet-vaguelette\ndecomposition and Galerkin method (if vaguelettes in the neighborhood of the\nsingularity point have infinite norms). The hybrid estimator is a combination\nof a linear part in the vicinity of the singularity point and the nonlinear\nblock thresholding wavelet estimator elsewhere. To attain adaptivity, an\noptimal resolution level for the linear, singularity affected, portion of the\nestimator is obtained using Lepski [Theory Probab.

However, a comparative\nanalysis of the two phenomena addressing in detail the transport of stellar\nlight through the planet's atmosphere has not yet been presented. Here, we\nproceed with the investigation of both phenomena by making use of a common\nformulation. Our starting point is a set of previously unpublished\nnear-infrared spectra collected at various phases during the August 2008 lunar\neclipse. We then take the formulation to the limit of an infinitely distant\nobserver in order to investigate the in-transit signature of the Earth-Sun\nsystem as being observed from outside our Solar System. The refraction-bending\nof sunlight rays that pass through the Earth's atmosphere is a critical factor\nin the illumination of the eclipsed Moon. Likewise, refraction will have an\nimpact on the in-transit transmission spectrum for specific planet-star systems\ndepending on the refractive properties of the planet's atmosphere, the stellar\nsize and the planet's orbital distance. For the Earth-Sun system, at\nmid-transit, refraction prevents the remote observer's access to the lower\n~12-14 km of the atmosphere and, thus, also to the bulk of the\nspectroscopically-active atmospheric gases. We demonstrate that the effective\noptical radius of the Earth in transit is modulated by refraction and varies by\n~12 km from mid-transit to 2nd contact. The refractive nature of atmospheres, a\nproperty which is rarely accounted for in published investigations, will pose\nadditional challenges to the characterization of Earth-like extrasolar planets.\nRefraction may have a lesser impact for Earth-like extrasolar planets within\nthe habitable zone of some M-type stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 21:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

An exemplary Gedanken experiment, emphasizing such a\nmeasurement-dependent nature, was suggested by Wheeler using single photons.\nThe subtleness of the idea lies in the fact that the output beam-splitter of a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer is put in or removed after a photon has already\nentered the interferometer, thus performing a delayed test of the wave-particle\ncomplementary behavior. Recently, it was proposed that using a quantum analogue\nof the output beam-splitter would permit carrying out this type of test after\nthe detection of the photon and observing wave-particle superposition. In this\npaper we describe an experimental demonstration of these predictions using\nanother extraordinary property of quantum systems, entanglement. We use a pair\nof polarization entangled photons composed of one photon whose nature (wave or\nparticle) is tested, and of a corroborative photon that allows determining\nwhich one, or both, of these two aspects is being tested. This corroborative\nphoton infers the presence or absence of the beam-splitter and until it is\nmeasured, the beam-splitter is in a superposition of these two states, making\nit a quantum beam-splitter. When the quantum beam-splitter is in the state\npresent or absent, the interferometer reveals the wave or particle nature of\nthe test photon, respectively. Furthermore, by manipulating the corroborative\nphoton, we can continuously morph, via entanglement, the test photon from wave\nto particle behavior even after it was detected.

The outer S2 flow appears in the D and E configuration maps\nand its outflow velocity is found to be in good agreement with high resolution\noptical spectroscopy of K I obtained at the McDonald Observatory. We image both\nS1 and S2 in the multi-configuration maps and see a gradual change in the\nangular size of the emission in the high absolute velocity maps. We assign an\nouter radius of 4\\arcsec to S1 and propose that S2 extends beyond CARMA's field\nof view (32\\arcsec at 1.3 mm) out to a radius of 17\\arcsec which is larger than\nrecent single-dish observations have indicated. When azimuthally averaged, the\nintensity fall-off for both flows is found to be proportional to R^{-1}, where\nR is the projected radius, indicating optically thin winds with \\rho \\propto\nR^{-2}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 22:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Defects in\nparticular genes encoding proteins that are involved in either the\nphotoreceptor structure, phototransduction cascades, or visual cycle are\nexpressed in the rods but ultimately affect both types of cells. RP is\n\"typically\" manifested by a steady death of rods followed by a period of\nstability in which cones survive initially and then inevitably die too. In some\nRP cases, rods and cones die off simultaneously or even cone death precedes rod\ndeath (reverse RP). The mechanisms and factors involved in the development of\nthe different types of RP are not well understood nor have researchers been\nable to provide more than a limited number of short-term therapies.

Three cases for neutrino masses are considered: (a)\nThe higher dimensional LH.LH operator (b) Dirac masses (c) Type I see-saw with\nbulk Majorana mass terms. Neutrino masses and mixing as well as charged lepton\nmasses are fit in the first two cases using $\\chi^2$ minimisation for the bulk\nmass parameters, while varying the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings between\n0.1 and 4.

This is addressed by von Neumann's concept of a\nself-replicating automaton (SRA). A SRA consists of a self-assembly code that\nis used in two distinct ways: (1) actively deciphered during development to\nconstruct a self-similar replicant, and (2) passively copied to the replicant\nto ensure that it can reproduce. Information that is acquired over a lifetime\nis not transmitted to offspring, whereas information that is inherited during\ncopying is transmitted. In cultural evolution there is no mechanism for\ndiscarding acquired change. Acquired change can accumulate orders of magnitude\nfaster than, and quickly overwhelm, inherited change due to differential\nreplication of variants in response to selection. This prohibits a selectionist\nbut not an evolutionary framework for culture. Recent work on the origin of\nlife suggests that early life evolved through a non-Darwinian process referred\nto as communal exchange that does not involve a self-assembly code, and that\nnatural selection emerged from this more haphazard, ancestral evolutionary\nprocess. It is proposed that communal exchange provides a more appropriate\nevolutionary framework for culture than selectionism.

In particular, we address the challenge of improving the standard\ntwo-way selective decode-and-forward protocol (TW-SDF) in terms of\nblock-error-rate (BLER) with minor additional complexity and energy\nconsumption. By following the principle of soft relaying, our solution is the\ntwo-way one-bit soft forwarding (TW-1bSF) protocol in which the relay forwards\nthe one-bit quantization of a posterior information metric about the\ntransmitted bits, associated with an appropriately designed reliability\nparameter.\n  In WSN-related standards (such as IEEE802.15.6 and Bluetooth), block codes\nare adopted instead of convolutional and other sophisticated codes, due to\ntheir efficient decoder hardware implementation. As the second main\ncontribution, we derive tight upper bounds on the BLER performance for both\nTW-SDF and TW-1bSF, when the two-way relaying network employs block codes and\nhard decoding. The error probability analysis confirms the superiority of\nTW-1bSF.

This friction triggers\nthe shear stress, which is traditionally presumed to be linearly proportional\nto the velocity gradient. The proportionality coefficient characterizes the\nviscosity of water. Remarkably, the standard Navier-Stokes model surmises that\nmaterials never fail - the transition to turbulence can only be triggered by\nsome kinematic instability of the flow. This premise is probably the reason why\nthe Navier-Stokes theory fails to explain the so-called subcritical transition\nto turbulence with the help of the linear instability analysis. When linear\ninstability analysis fails, nonlinear instability analysis is often resorted\nto, but, despite the occasional uses of this approach, it is intrinsically\nbiased to require finite flow perturbations which do not necessarily exist.\n  In the present work we relax the traditional restriction on the perfectly\nintact material and introduce the parameter of fluid viscous strength, which\nenforces the breakdown of internal friction. We develop a generalized\nNavier-Stokes constitutive model which includes a material failure description,\nand use it to analyze the Couette flow between two parallel plates to find that\nthe lateral infinitesimal perturbations can destabilize the laminar flow.\nFurthermore, we use the results of the recent experiments on the onset of\nturbulence in pipe flow to calibrate the viscous strength of water.\nSpecifically, we find that the maximal shear stress that water can sustain in\nthe laminar flow is about one Pascal. We note also that the introduction of the\nfluid strength uncovers new prospects in the explanation of the remarkable\nphenomenon of the delay of the transition to turbulence due to an addition of a\nsmall amount of long polymer molecules to water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 06:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

In the\nemergence of order out of self-organization we find similarities between\nbiological systems, as bird flocks, and some physical systems, as ferromagnets.\nIn both cases, the tendency of individuals to align to their neighbours gives\nrise to a polarized state. There is, however, one crucial difference: the\ninteraction network within an animal group is not necessarily fixed in time, as\neach individual moves and may change its neighbours. Therefore, the dynamical\ninteraction mechanism in biological and physical system can be quite different,\nnot only due to the gross disparity in the complexity of the individual\nentities, but also because of the potential role of inter-individual motion. To\nassess the relevance of this mechanism it is necessary to gain quantitative\nexperimental information about how much individuals move with respect to each\nother within the group. Here, by using data from field observations on\nstarlings, we study the diffusion properties of individual birds within a flock\nand investigate the effect of diffusion on the dynamics of the interaction\nnetwork. We find that birds diffuse faster than Brownian particles\n(superdiffusion) and in a strongly anisotropic way. We also find that\nneighbours change in time exclusively as a consequence of diffusion, so that no\nspecific mechanism to keep one's neighbours seems to be enforced. Finally, we\nstudy the diffusion properties of birds at the border of the flock. We find\nthat these individuals remain on the border significantly longer than what\nwould be expected on the basis of a purely diffusional model, suggesting that\nthere is a sort barrier a bird must cross to make the transition from border to\ninterior of the flock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 09:52:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 20:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-14"}

The former have a surface-trapped structure,\nwhile the latter have a more grave form. To assess the relative importance of\neach contribution to the signal, it is useful to project the observed field\nonto a set of modes that separates their influence in a natural way. However,\nthe surface-trapped dynamics are not well-represented by standard baroclinic\nmodes; moreover, they are dependent on horizontal scale.\n  Here we derive a modal decomposition that results from the simultaneous\ndiagonalization of the energy and a generalisation of potential enstrophy that\nincludes contributions from the surface buoyancy fields. This approach yields a\nfamily of orthonomal bases that depend on two parameters: the standard\nbaroclinic modes are recovered in a limiting case, while other choices provide\nmodes that represent surface and interior dynamics in an efficient way.\n  For constant stratification, these modes consist of symmetric and\nantisymmetric exponential modes that capture the surface dynamics, and a series\nof oscillating modes that represent the interior dynamics. Motivated by the\nocean, where shears are concentrated near the upper surface, we also consider\nthe special case of a quiescent lower surface. In this case, the interior modes\nare independent of wavenumber, and there is a single exponential surface mode\nthat replaces the barotropic mode. We demonstrate the use and effectiveness of\nthese modes by projecting the energy in a set of simulations of baroclinic\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 12:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this\npaper we focus on recent experimental evidence, showing that a class of\nspontaneous oscillations can emerge within the Up states. In particular, a\nnon-trivial peak around 20 Hz appears in their associated power-spectra, what\nproduces an enhancement of the activity power for higher frequencies (in the\n30-90 Hz band). Moreover, this rhythm within Ups seems to be an emergent or\ncollective phenomenon given that individual neurons do not lock to it as they\nremain mostly unsynchronized. Remarkably, similar oscillations (and the\nconcomitant peak in the spectrum) do not appear in the Down states. Here we\nshed light on these findings by using different computational models for the\ndynamics of cortical networks in presence of different levels of physiological\ncomplexity. Our conclusion, supported by both theory and simulations, is that\nthe collective phenomenon of \"stochastic amplification of fluctuations\"\n-previously described in other contexts such as Ecology and Epidemiology--\nexplains in an elegant and parsimonious manner, beyond model-dependent details,\nthis extra-rhythm emerging only in the Up states but not in the Downs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 12:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Exploit- ing the emptiness property of high dimensional\nspaces, a kernel based on the Mahalanobis distance is proposed. The computation\nof the Mahalanobis distance requires the inversion of a covariance matrix. In\nhigh dimensional spaces, the estimated covariance matrix is ill-conditioned and\nits inversion is unstable or impossible. Using a parsimonious statistical\nmodel, namely the High Dimensional Discriminant Analysis model, the specific\nsignal and noise subspaces are estimated for each considered class making the\ninverse of the class specific covariance matrix explicit and stable, leading to\nthe definition of a parsimonious Mahalanobis kernel. A SVM based framework is\nused for selecting the hyperparameters of the parsimonious Mahalanobis kernel\nby optimizing the so-called radius-margin bound. Experimental results on three\nhigh dimensional data sets show that the proposed kernel is suitable for\nclassifying high dimensional data, providing better classification accuracies\nthan the conventional Gaussian kernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 12:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 13:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

The state of a network is described by the times elapsed\nsince its neurons fired within the post-synaptic transfer kernel memory span,\nand the current strengths of synaptic connections, the state spaces of our\nmodels being hierarchies of finite-dimensional components. We establish\nergodicity of the stochastic processes describing the behaviour of the networks\nand prove the existence of continuously differentiable stationary distribution\ndensities (with respect to the Lebesgue measures of corresponding\ndimensionality) on the components of the state space and find upper bounds for\nthem. For the density components, we derive a system of differential equations\nthat can be solved in a few simplest cases only. Approaches to approximate\ncomputation of the stationary density are discussed. One is to reduce the\ndimensionality of the problem by modifying the network so that each neuron\ncannot fire if the number of spikes it emitted within the post-synaptic\ntransfer kernel memory span reaches a given threshold. We show that the\nstationary distribution of this `truncated' network converges to that of the\nunrestricted one as the threshold increases, and that the convergence is at a\nsuper-exponential rate. A complementary approach uses discrete Markov chain\napproximations to the network process. We derive linear systems for the\nstationary distributions of these Markov chains and prove that these\ndistributions converge weakly to the stationary laws for the original\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 13:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

A deterministic backoff is used after\nsuccessful transmissions and a random backoff is used otherwise. It is\nexplained that the short acknowledgement control packets can easily result in\nchannel time fragmentation and, to avoid this, the use of link layer delayed\nacknowledgements is advocated and implemented.

One of the principal reasons for the\nimportance of PSWFs is that they are a natural and efficient tool for computing\nwith bandlimited functions, that frequently occur in the abovementioned areas.\nThis is due to the fact that PSWFs are the eigenfunctions of the integral\noperator, that represents timelimiting followed by lowpassing.\n  Needless to say, the behavior of this operator is governed by the decay rate\nof its eigenvalues. Therefore, investigation of this decay rate plays a crucial\nrole in the related theory and applications - for example, in construction of\nquadratures, interpolation, filter design, etc.\n  The significance of PSWFs and, in particular, of the decay rate of the\neigenvalues of the associated integral operator, was realized at least half a\ncentury ago. Nevertheless, perhaps surprisingly, despite vast numerical\nexperience and existence of several asymptotic expansions, a non-trivial\nexplicit upper bound on the magnitude of the eigenvalues has been missing for\ndecades.\n  The principal goal of this paper is to close this gap in the theory of PSWFs.\nWe analyze the integral operator associated with PSWFs, to derive fairly tight\nnon-asymptotic upper bounds on the magnitude of its eigenvalues. Our results\nare illustrated via several numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 15:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

Continuous Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) avoid\ntime-slicing in the representation by modeling the system as evolving\ncontinuously over time. The expectation-propagation (EP) inference algorithm of\nNodelman et al.

The main computational difficulty in learning such models\nis inference. Even when dealing with complete data, where one can summarize a\nlarge domain by sufficient statistics, learning requires one to compute the\nexpectation of the sufficient statistics given different parameter choices. The\ntypical solution to this problem is to resort to approximate inference\nprocedures, such as loopy belief propagation. Although these procedures are\nquite efficient, they still require computation that is on the order of the\nnumber of interactions (or features) in the model. When learning a large\nrelational model over a complex domain, even such approximations require\nunrealistic running time. In this paper we show that for a particular class of\nrelational MRFs, which have inherent symmetry, we can perform the inference\nneeded for learning procedures using a template-level belief propagation. This\nprocedure's running time is proportional to the size of the relational model\nrather than the size of the domain. Moreover, we show that this computational\nprocedure is equivalent to sychronous loopy belief propagation. This enables a\ndramatic speedup in inference and learning time.

We generalize the algorithm\nand improve its scalability by reducing the complexity with respect to the\nnumber of observations from exponential to polynomial. We derive error bounds\non solution quality with respect to this new approximation and analyze the\nconvergence behavior. To evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements, we\nintroduce a new, larger benchmark problem. Experimental results show that\ndespite the high complexity of decentralized POMDPs, scalable solution\ntechniques such as MBDP perform surprisingly well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 15:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

In the paper we\nthen generalize our result and arrive at general expression for energy density\nirrespective of the model. The thermodynamical stability for both of the model\nand the general case is discussed from this viewpoint. We also arrive at a\ncondition on the limiting behavior of thermodynamic parameter to validate the\nthird law of thermodynamics and interpret the general mathematical expression\nof integration constant $U_{0}$ (what we get while integrating energy\nconservation equation) physically relating it to number of micro states. The\nconstraint on the allowed values of the parameters of the models is discussed\nwhich ascertains stability of universe. The validity of thermodynamical laws\nwithin apparent and event horizon is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 15:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}
