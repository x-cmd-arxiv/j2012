A new relatively simple method\nof parameter estimation for nonlinear systems is presented, based on variations\nin the accuracy of probability forecasts.

In spite of the many efforts aimed at\nassessing the performances of density functional theory for such systems, an\nexchange-correlation functional able to account accurately for the energetic of\nthe various possible spin-states has not been identified yet. Here we\ncritically discuss the issues related to the theoretical description of this\nclass of molecules from first principles. In particular we present a comparison\nbetween different density functionals for four ions, namely\n[Fe(H$_2$O)$_6$]$^{2+}$, [Fe(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{2+}$, [Fe(NCH)$_6$]$^{2+}$ and\n[Fe(CO)$_6$]$^{2+}$. These are characterized by different ligand-field\nsplittings and ground state spin multiplicities. Since no experimental data are\navailable for the gas phase, the density functional theory results are\nbenchmarked against those obtained with diffusion Monte Carlo, one of the most\naccurate methods available to compute ground state total energies of quantum\nsystems. On the one hand, we show that most of the functionals considered\nprovide a good description of the geometry and of the shape of the potential\nenergy surfaces. On the other hand, the same functionals fail badly in\npredicting the energy differences between the various spin states. In the case\nof [Fe(H$_2$O)$_6$]$^{2+}$, [Fe(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{2+}$, [Fe(NCH)$_6$]$^{2+}$, this\nfailure is related to the drastic underestimation of the exchange energy.\nTherefore quite accurate results can be achieved with hybrid functionals\nincluding about 50% of Hartree-Fock exchange. In contrast, in the case of\n[Fe(CO)$_6$]$^{2+}$, the failure is likely to be caused by the\nmulticonfigurational character of the ground state wave-function and no\nsuitable exchange and correlation functional has been identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 18:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In particular, the case of deflection by\nmeans of Solar-pumped Laser ablation is studied here in detail. The basic idea\nbehind Laser ablation is that of inducing a sublimation of the NEO surface,\nwhich produces a low thrust thereby slowly deviating the asteroid from its\ninitial Earth threatening trajectory. This work investigates the integrated\ndesign of the Space-based Laser system and the deflection action generated by\nlaser ablation under uncertainty. The integrated design is formulated as a\nmulti-objective optimisation problem in which the deviation is maximised and\nthe total system mass is minimised. Both the model for the estimation of the\nthrust produced by surface laser ablation and the spacecraft system model are\nassumed to be affected by epistemic uncertainties (partial or complete lack of\nknowledge). Evidence Theory is used to quantify these uncertainties and\nintroduce them in the optimisation process.

A sex-ratio allele is\nexpressed in the heterogametic sex only, so that assumptions of Fisher's\nanalysis do not apply. Sex-ratio evolution drives cultural evolution of a\ngroup-associated trait governing mortality in the homogametic sex. The two-sex\ndynamics under resource limitation induces a strong Allee effect that depends\non both sex ratio and cultural trait values. We describe the resulting\nthreshold, separating extinction from positive growth, as a function of female\nand male densities. When initial conditions avoid extinction due to the Allee\neffect, different sex ratios cannot coexist; in our model, greater female\nallocation always invades and excludes a lesser allocation. But the culturally\ntransmitted trait interacts with the sex ratio to determine the ecological\nconsequences of successful invasion. The invading female allocation may permit\npopulation persistence at self-regulated equilibrium. For this case, the\nresident culture may be excluded, or may coexist with the invader culture. That\nis, a single sex-ratio allele in females and a cultural dimorphism in male\nmortality can persist; a low-mortality resident trait is maintained by\nfather-to-son cultural transmission. Otherwise, the successfully invading\nfemale allocation excludes the resident allele and culture, and then drives the\npopulation to extinction via a shortage of males.

We\nobserved a strong secular decrease in water and all other observed species\nproduction in 2010/11 from the 1991 and 1997/98 levels. We see evidence for a\nstrong asymmetry with respect to perihelion in the production rates of our\nusual bandpasses, with peak production occurring ~10 days post-perihelion and\nproduction rates considerably higher post-perihelion. The composition was\n\"typical\", in agreement with the findings of other investigators. We obtained\nimaging on 39 nights from 2010 July until 2011 January. We find that, after\naccounting for their varying parentage and lifetimes, the C2 and C3 coma\nmorphology resemble the CN morphology we reported previously. These species\nexhibited an hourglass shape in October and November, and the morphology\nchanged with rotation and evolved over time. The OH and NH coma morphology\nshowed hints of an hourglass shape near the nucleus, but was also enhanced in\nthe anti-sunward hemisphere. This tailward brightness enhancement did not vary\nsignificantly with rotation and evolved with the viewing geometry. We conclude\nthat all five gas species likely originate from the same source regions on the\nnucleus, but that OH and NH were derived from small grains of water and ammonia\nice that survived long enough to be affected by radiation pressure and driven\nin the anti-sunward direction. We detected the faint, sunward facing dust jet\nreported by other authors, and did not detect a corresponding gas feature. This\njet varied little during a night but exhibited some variations from night to\nnight, suggesting it is located near the total angular momentum vector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 19:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Furthermore, our two galaxy formation models give results\nconsistent with the observed profile of the 11 classical satellites of the\nMilky Way. Our simulations predict that larger, fainter samples of satellites\nshould still retain this profile at least up to samples of 100 satellites.

We\nverify that a typical Milky Way-mass CDM halo does not acquire its 11 most\nmassive satellites from a small number of rich groups.

Modeling the gas\ndistribution responsible for the broad H-alpha, H-beta and H-gamma emission\nlines favors a spherically symmetric inflow as opposed to a thin disk. Adopting\na central black hole mass of 7.6 x 10^{6} Msun, determined from prior\nreverberation mapping, leads to the following dimensions for the size of the\nregion emitting the broad H-alpha line; an outer radius ~ 90 l.d and an inner\nradius ~ 3 l.d. Thus, the previously determined reverberation size for the\nbroad line region (BLR) consistently coincides with the inner radius of a much\nlarger volume of ionized gas. However, the perceived size of the BLR is an\nillusion, a consequence of the fact that the emitting region is ionization\nbounded at the outer radius and diminished by Doppler broadening at the inner\nradius. The actual dimensions of the inflow remain to be determined.\nNevertheless, the steady state mass inflow rate is estimated to be ~ 10^{-2}\nMsun/yr which is sufficient to explain the X-ray luminosity of the AGN in terms\nof radiatively inefficient accretion.

In contrast to the disk-based sensing model in\na traditional sensor network, the detection range of a bistatic radar depends\non the locations of both the radar transmitter and radar receiver, and is\ncharacterized by Cassini ovals. Furthermore, in a network with multiple radar\ntransmitters and receivers, since any pair of transmitter and receiver can\npotentially form a bistatic radar, the detection ranges of different bistatic\nradars are coupled and the corresponding network coverage is intimately related\nto the locations of all transmitters and receivers, making the optimal\ndeployment design highly non-trivial. Clearly, the detectability of an intruder\ndepends on the highest SNR received by all possible bistatic radars. We focus\non the worst-case intrusion detectability, i.e., the minimum possible\ndetectability along all possible intrusion paths. Although it is plausible to\ndeploy radars on a shortest line segment across the field, it is not always\noptimal in general, which we illustrate via counter-examples. We then present a\nsufficient condition on the field geometry for the optimality of shortest line\ndeployment to hold. Further, we quantify the local structure of detectability\ncorresponding to a given deployment order and spacings of radar transmitters\nand receivers, building on which we characterize the optimal deployment to\nmaximize the worst-case intrusion detectability. Our results show that the\noptimal deployment locations exhibit a balanced structure. We also develop a\npolynomial-time approximation algorithm for characterizing the worse-case\nintrusion path for any given locations of radars under random deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 21:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-08"}

By accounting for the dynamical back-reaction of the\nnon-thermal particles, such a theory in fact predicts that the more efficient\nthe particle acceleration, the flatter the CR spectrum. In this work we put\nforward a self-consistent scenario in which the account for the magnetic field\namplification induced by CR streaming produces the conditions for reversing\nsuch a trend, allowing --- at the same time --- for rather steep spectra and CR\nacceleration efficiencies (about 20%) consistent with the hypothesis that SNRs\nare the sources of Galactic CRs.

In our set-up, a 1\nns, 3.8 kJ laser pulse irradiates a 20 micron beryllium disk, driving a shock\ninto a xenon-filled plastic tube. The electrons emit radiation behind the\nshock. This radiation from the shocked xenon preheats the unshocked xenon.\nPhotons traveling ahead of the shock will also interact with the plastic tube,\nheat it, and in turn this can drive another shock off the wall into the xenon.\nWe are now able to simulate the long term evolution of radiative shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 23:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-08"}

One\ndifficulty, however, is that with the short exposure time ($\\simeq$15 seconds)\nproposed, the spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) shapes may\nbe dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics\nerrors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a\nsingle CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide\nrange of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,\ncomplex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in\nthe field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the\nPSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps\nwith a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from\nthe LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a\n5th-order polynomial fit (representing the current standard) and a simple\nboxcar smoothing technique. Quantitatively, PSFent predicts more accurate PSF\nmodels in all scenarios and the residual PSF errors are spatially less\ncorrelated. This improvement in PSF interpolation leads to a factor of 3.5\nlower systematic errors in the shear power spectrum on scales smaller than\n$\\sim13'$, compared to polynomial fitting. We estimate that with PSFent and for\nstellar densities greater than $\\simeq1/{\\rm arcmin}^{2}$, the spurious shear\ncorrelation from PSF interpolation, after combining a complete 10-year dataset\nfrom LSST, is lower than the corresponding statistical uncertainties on the\ncosmic shear power spectrum, even under a conservative scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 01:24:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2012 21:38:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 01:53:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 15:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 16:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This holds at all scales,\nbut especially for the largest parallel computers being built and planned\ntoday. As processor counts continue to grow, the cost of ensuring reliability\nconsistently throughout an application will become unbearable. However, many\nalgorithms only need reliability for certain data and phases of computation.\nThis suggests an algorithm and system codesign approach. We show that if the\nsystem lets applications apply reliability selectively, we can develop\nalgorithms that compute the right answer despite faults. These \"fault-tolerant\"\niterative methods either converge eventually, at a rate that degrades\ngracefully with increased fault rate, or return a clear failure indication in\nthe rare case that they cannot converge. Furthermore, they store most of their\ndata unreliably, and spend most of their time in unreliable mode.\n  We demonstrate this for the specific case of detected but uncorrectable\nmemory faults, which we argue are representative of all kinds of faults. We\ndeveloped a cross-layer application / operating system framework that\nintercepts and reports uncorrectable memory faults to the application, rather\nthan killing the application, as current operating systems do. The application\nin turn can mark memory allocations as subject to such faults. Using this\nframework, we wrote a fault-tolerant iterative linear solver using components\nfrom the Trilinos solvers library. Our solver exploits hybrid parallelism (MPI\nand threads). It performs just as well as other solvers if no faults occur, and\nconverges where other solvers do not in the presence of faults. We show\nconvergence results for representative test problems. Near-term future work\nwill include performance tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 03:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-08"}

If a model is formulated in this way, it is possible to\ngeneralise it and allow for an inhomogeneous process, with time-dependent rates\nsatisfying the same constraints.

I\npropose a model which attributes formation of streams to the process of the\nelectric current adjustment in the magnetosphere. A mismatch between the\nmagnetospheric current distribution and the current injected by the polar cap\naccelerator gives rise to reverse plasma flows in the magnetosphere. The\nreverse flow shields the electric field in the polar gap and thus shuts up the\nplasma production process. I assume that a circulating system of streams is\nformed such that the upward streams are produced in narrow gaps separated by\ndownward streams. The electric drift is small in this model because the\npotential drop in narrow gaps is small. The gaps have to drift because by the\ntime a downward stream reaches the star surface and shields the electric field,\nthe corresponding gap has to shift. The transverse size of the streams is\ndetermined by the condition that the potential drop in the gaps is sufficient\nfor the pair production. This yields the radius of the stream roughly 10% of\nthe polar cap radius, which makes it possible to fit in the observed\nmorphological features such as the \"carousel\" with 10-20 subbeams and the\nsystem of the core - two nested cone beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 07:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However, they are not appropriate to\ncharacteristics of spatiotemporal mobility patterns in wireless networks.

Two-body planet-asteroid resonances are widely known, due to the\nKirkwood gaps. Besides, so-called three-body mean motion resonances exist, in\nwhich an asteroid and two planets participate. Identification of asteroids in\nthree-body (namely, Jupiter-Saturn-asteroid) resonances was initially\naccomplished by D.Nesvorny and A.Morbidelli (1998), who, by means of visual\nanalysis of the time behaviour of resonant arguments, found 255 asteroids to\nreside in such resonances. We develop specialized algorithms and software for\nmassive automatic identification of asteroids in the three-body, as well as\ntwo-body, resonances of arbitrary order, by means of automatic analysis of the\ntime behaviour of resonant arguments. In the computation of orbits, all\nessential perturbations are taken into account. We integrate the asteroidal\norbits on the time interval of 100000 yr and identify main-belt asteroids in\nthe three-body Jupiter-Saturn-asteroid resonances up to the 6th order\ninclusive, and in the two-body Jupiter-asteroid resonances up to the 9th order\ninclusive, in the set of ~250000 objects from the \"Asteroids - Dynamic Site\"\n(AstDyS) database. The percentages of resonant objects, including\nextrapolations for higher-order resonances, are determined. In particular, the\nobserved fraction of pure-resonant asteroids (those exhibiting resonant\nlibration on the whole interval of integration) in the three-body resonances up\nto the 6th order inclusive is approximately 0.9% of the whole set; and, using a\nhigher-order extrapolation, the actual total fraction of pure-resonant\nasteroids in the three-body resonances of all orders is estimated as\napproximately 1.1% of the whole set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 11:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 10:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Hierarchical models are\ntightly related to iteration of maps and, in fact, very similar phenomena have\nbeen repeatedly reported in many fields of mathematics, like combinatorial\nevaluations and discrete branching processes. It is precisely in the context of\nbranching processes with bounded off-spring that T. Harris, in 1948, first set\nforth the possibility that the logarithm of the moment generating function of\nthe rescaled population size, in the super-critical regime, does not grow near\ninfinity as a power, but it has an oscillatory prefactor. These oscillations\nhave been observed numerically only much later and, while the origin is clearly\ntied to the discrete character of the iteration, the amplitude size is not so\nwell understood. The purpose of this note is to reconsider the issue for\nhierarchical models and in what is arguably the most elementary setting -- the\npinning model -- that actually just boils down to iteration of polynomial maps\n(and, notably, quadratic maps). In this note we show that the oscillatory\ncritical amplitude for pinning models and the oscillating pre factor connected\nto the Harris random variable coincide. Moreover we make explicit the link\nbetween these oscillatory functions and the geometry of the Julia set of the\nmap, making thus rigorous and quantitative some ideas set forth by B. Derrida,\nC. Itzykson and J. M. Luck (CMP 1984).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 12:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

These random\nwalks are typically quantum in their behavior, step by step, but they seem to\nshow up a rather classical asymptotic behavior, as opposed to the quantum\nrandom walks usually considered in Quantum Information Theory (such as the\nwell-known Hadamard random walk). Typically, in the case of Open Quantum Random\nWalks on lattices, their distribution seems to always converge to a Gaussian\ndistribution or a mixture of Gaussian distributions. In the case of nearest\nneighbors homogeneous Open Quantum Random Walks on $\\ZZ^d$ we prove such a\nCentral Limit Theorem, in the case where only one Gaussian distribution appears\nin the limit. Through the quantum trajectory point of view on quantum master\nequations, we transform the problem into studying a certain functional of a\nMarkov chain on $\\ZZ^d$ times the Banach space of quantum states. The main\ndifficulty is that we know nothing about the invariant measures of this Markov\nchain, even their existence. Surprisingly enough, we are able to produce a\nCentral Limit Theorem with explicit drift and explicit covariance matrix. The\ninteresting point which appears with our construction and result is that it\napplies actually to a wider setup: it provides a Central Limit Theorem for the\nsequence of recordings of the quantum trajectories associated to any completely\npositive map. This is what we show and develop as an application of our result.\n  In a second step we are able to extend our Central Limit Theorem to the case\nof several asymptotic Gaussians, in the case where the operator coefficients of\nthe quantum walk are block-diagonal in a common basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 12:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2013 08:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-20"}

We\nalso analyze correlations in terms of sums of squared Q-functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 13:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-08"}

RV\nobservations with the Hobby-Eberly and Keck telescopes yield an RV that has the\nsame period as the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transit\ncenter by approximately -0.22 periods. The amplitude (half range) of the RV\nvariations is 2.4 km/s and is comparable with the expected RV amplitude that\nstellar spots could induce. The RV curve is likely dominated by stellar spot\nmodulation and provides an upper limit to the projected companion mass of M_p\nsin i_orb < 4.8 +- 1.2 M_Jup; when combined with the orbital inclination, i\norb, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit light curve, we find\nan upper limit on the mass of the planetary candidate of M_p < 5.5 +- 1.4\nM_Jup. This limit implies that the planet is orbiting close to, if not inside,\nits Roche limiting orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active mass\nloss and evaporation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 14:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 20:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

Previous observations of this z=0.44\nsystem showed that as well as powering the hyper-luminous infrared emission of\nthe cluster-central galaxy, the QSO is associated with a double-lobed radio\nsource. However, the steep radio spectral index and misalignment between the\njets and ionised optical emission suggested that the orientation of the QSO had\nrecently changed. We use a combination of new, multi-band Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope observations and archival radio data to confirm that the jets are no\nlonger powered by the QSO, and estimate their age to be 120-160 Myr. This is in\nagreement with the ~70-200 Myr age previously estimated for star-formation in\nthe galaxy. Previously unpublished Very Long Baseline Array data reveal a 200\npc scale double radio source in the galaxy core which is more closely aligned\nwith the current QSO axis and may represent a more recent period of jet\nactivity. These results suggest that the realignment of the QSO, the cessation\nof jet activity, and the onset of rapid star-formation may have been caused by\na gas-rich galaxy merger. A Chandra X-ray observation confirms the presence of\ncavities associated with the radio jets, and we estimate the energy required to\ninflate them to be ~7.7x10^60 erg. The mechanical power of the jets is\nsufficient to balance radiative cooling in the cluster, provided they are\nefficiently coupled to the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We find no evidence of\ndirect radiative heating and conclude that the QSO either lacks the radiative\nluminosity to heat the ICM, or that it requires longer than 100-200 Myr to\nsignificantly impact its environment.

We derive\nthe expansion properties of MCs in the outer heliosphere from one to five\nastronomical units to compare them with those in the inner heliosphere. We\nanalyze MCs observed by the Ulysses spacecraft using insitu magnetic field and\nplasma measurements.

We derive the value of zeta\nfrom the insitu velocity data. We analyze separately the non-perturbed MCs\n(cases showing a linear velocity profile almost for the full event), and\nperturbed MCs (cases showing a strongly distorted velocity profile). We find\nthat non-perturbed MCs expand with a similar non-dimensional expansion rate\n(zeta=1.05+-0.34), i.e. slightly faster than at the solar distance and in the\ninner heliosphere (zeta=0.91+-0.23). The subset of perturbed MCs expands, as in\nthe inner heliosphere, at a significantly lower rate and with a larger\ndispersion (zeta=0.28+-0.52) as expected from the temporal evolution found in\nnumerical simulations.

The\ndynamical system of equations is solved numerically and a stable scaling\nsolution is obtained. A significant attempt towards the solution of the cosmic\ncoincidence problem is taken.

We\nvalidate as well as extend previous results for spheres and cylinders, and also\ncompute the heat transfer in a more complicated geometry consisting of two\ninterlocked rings. Finally, we demonstrate that the method can be readily\nadapted to compute the spatial distribution of heat flux on the surface of the\ninteracting bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 01:33:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 14:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}
