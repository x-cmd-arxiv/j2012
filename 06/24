This is done by employing\na unique dataset, consisting of the planar graph representation of nine time\nslices of Greater London's road network spanning 224 years, from 1786 to 2010.\nWithin this time-frame, we address the concept of the metropolitan area or city\nin physical terms, in that urban evolution reveals observable transitions in\nthe distribution of relevant geometrical properties. Given that London has a\nhard boundary enforced by its long-standing green belt, we show that its street\nnetwork dynamics can be described as a fractal space-filling phenomena up to a\ncapacitated limit, whence its growth can be predicted with a striking level of\naccuracy. This observation is confirmed by the analytical calculation of key\ntopological properties of the planar graph, such as the topological growth of\nthe network and its average connectivity. This study thus represents an example\nof a strong violation of Gibrat's law. In particular, we are able to show\nanalytically how London evolves from a more loop-like structure, typical of\nplanned cities, toward a more tree-like structure, typical of self-organized\ncities. These observations are relevant to the discourse on sustainable urban\nplanning with respect to the control of urban sprawl in many large cities,\nwhich have developed under the conditions of spatial constraints imposed by\ngreen belts and hard urban boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2012 00:41:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 10:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This expanding gas loses energy\nby radiative cooling and then falls back toward the galactic center.\nSubsequently, the starburst is enhanced again.

We wish to examine the differences of\nthe column density distributions derived from dust extinction, scattering, and\nemission, and to determine to what extent the observations are consistent with\nthe standard dust models. From Herschel data, we calculate the column density\ndistribution that is compared to the corresponding data derived in the\nnear-infrared regime from the reddening of the background stars, and from the\nsurface brightness attributed to light scattering. We construct\nthree-dimensional radiative transfer models to describe the emission and the\nscattering. The scattered light traces low column densities of A_V~1mag better\nthan the dust emission, remaining useful to A_V ~ 10-15 mag. Based on the\nmodels, the extinction and the level of dust emission are surprisingly\nconsistent with a sub-millimetre dust emissivity typical of diffuse medium.\nHowever, the intensity of the scattered light is very low at the centre of the\ndensest clump and this cannot be explained without a very low grain albedo.\nBoth the scattered light and dust emission indicate an anisotropic radiation\nfield. The modelling of the dust emission suggests that the radiation field\nintensity is at least three times the value of the normal interstellar\nradiation field. The inter-comparison between the extinction, light scattering,\nand dust emission provides very stringent constraints on the cloud structure,\nthe illuminating radiation field, and the grain properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2012 21:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Using GaN as an example case and the direct non-equilibrium method,\nextensive molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo analysis of the\nresults have been carried out to quantify the uncertainty level of the\nmolecular dynamics methods and to identify the conditions that can yield\nsufficiently accurate calculations of thermal conductivity. We found that the\nerrors of the calculations are mainly due to the statistical thermal\nfluctuations. Extrapolating results to the limit of an infinite-size system\ntend to magnify the errors and occasionally lead to unphysical results. The\nerror in bulk estimates can be reduced by performing longer time averages using\nproperly selected systems over a range of sample lengths. If the errors in the\nconductivity estimates associated with each of the sample lengths are kept\nbelow a certain threshold, the likelihood of obtaining unphysical bulk values\nbecomes insignificant.

The main objective is to accurately perform\nanalysis of the impact of link layer reliability schemes (obtained by the use\nof real physical traces) on transport layer performance. We detail the internal\nmechanisms and the benefits of this software with a focus on 4G satellite\ncommunications scenarios and present the resulting metrics provided by CLIFT to\nperform consistent cross-layer analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2012 02:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

Firstly, the RE depends on the heating and\ncooling rates of the gas by the radiation field, two quantities that almost\ncompletely cancel and are very difficult to calculate accurately. Secondly, the\ninternal energy of the gas is only a tiny fraction of the total energy in the\nsystem (the vast majority of the energy resides in the radiation field), so\nthat the vast majority of the energy is neglected in solving for the energy\nbalance.\n  The method presented in this paper, based on the /radiation energy balance/,\naddresses the bulk of the energy, does not depend on the heating/cooling rates,\nguarantees an accurate run of the bolometric luminosity over time while\nbringing the gas temperatures into consistence with the radiation field.\n  We have implemented the method in the stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX and\napplied it to the classical W7 model.

As in the fluid dynamic limit of the Boltzmann\nequation, we first make the Hilbert expansion for the solution of the\nDoi-Onsager equation. The existence of the Hilbert expansion is connected to an\nopen question whether the energy of the Ericksen-Leslie equation is dissipated.\nWe show that the energy is dissipated for the Ericksen-Leslie equation derived\nfrom the Doi-Onsager equation. The most difficult step is to prove a uniform\nbound for the remainder in the Hilbert expansion. This question is connected to\nthe spectral stability of the linearized Doi-Onsager operator around a critical\npoint. By introducing two important auxiliary operators, the detailed spectral\ninformation is obtained for the linearized operator around all critical points.\nHowever, these are not enough to justify the small Deborah number limit for the\ninhomogeneous Doi-Onsager equation, since the elastic stress in the velocity\nequation is also strongly singular. For this, we need to establish a precise\nlower bound for a bilinear form associated with the linearized operator. In the\nbilinear form, the interactions between the part inside the kernel and the part\noutside the kernel of the linearized operator are very complicated. We find a\ncoordinate transform and introduce a five dimensional space called the\nMaier-Saupe space such that the interactions between two parts can been seen\nexplicitly by a delicate argument of completing the square. However, the lower\nbound is very weak for the part inside the Maier-Saupe space. In order to apply\nthem to the error estimates, we have to analyze the structure of the singular\nterms and introduce a suitable energy functional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2012 10:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

A\nkey finding is that the majority of reviewed studies concentrates on client\nsatisfaction, thus neglecting the vendor perspective. We argue that this raises\nquestions about the construct validity of these studies. Consequently, concerns\nexist about the validity and reliability of their empirical findings.

A unique feature of this formulation is that the\naction remains finite for the discontinuous fields (although continuity is\nrecovered on the equations of motion). This means that the spacetime can be\ndecomposed into the 4-simplices virtually not coinciding on their common faces,\nthat is, independent. This allows, in particular, to consider a surface as\nconsisting of a set of virtually independent elementary pieces (2-simplices).\nThen the spectrum of surface area is the sum of the spectra of independent\nelementary areas. We use connection representation of the Faddeev action for\nthe piecewise flat (simplicial) manifold earlier proposed in our work. The\nspectrum of elementary areas is the spectrum of the field bilinears which are\ncanonically conjugate to the orthogonal connection matrices. We find that the\nelementary area spectrum is proportional to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter\n$\\gamma$ in the Faddeev gravity and is similar to the spectrum of the angular\nmomentum in the space with the dimension $d - 2$. Knowing this spectrum allows\nto estimate statistical black hole entropy. Requiring that this entropy\ncoincide with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy gives the equation, known in the\nliterature.
