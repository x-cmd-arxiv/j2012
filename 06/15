Such techniques yield a\nversion for K\\\"ahler affine metrics of Yau's Schwarz lemma for volume forms. By\na theorem of Cheng and Yau there is a canonical K\\\"ahler affine Einstein metric\non a proper convex domain, and the Schwarz lemma gives a direct proof of its\nuniqueness up to homothety. The potential for this metric is a function\ncanonically associated to the cone, characterized by the property that its\nlevel sets are hyperbolic affine spheres foliating the cone. It is shown that\nfor an $n$-dimensional cone a rescaling of the canonical potential is an\n$n$-normal barrier function in the sense of interior point methods for conic\nprogramming. It is explained also how to construct from the canonical potential\nMonge-Amp\\`ere metrics of both Riemannian and Lorentzian signatures, and a mean\ncurvature zero conical Lagrangian submanifold of the flat para-K\\\"ahler space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 16:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 21:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

The formal\nverification of such software poses significant challenges. On the one side,\neach thread may have infinite state space, and might call for abstraction. On\nthe other side, the scheduling policy is often important for correctness, and\nan approach based on abstracting the scheduler may result in loss of precision\nand false positives. Unfortunately, the translation of the problem into a\npurely sequential software model checking problem turns out to be highly\ninefficient for the available technologies. We propose a software model\nchecking technique that exploits the intrinsic structure of these programs.\nEach thread is translated into a separate sequential program and explored\nsymbolically with lazy abstraction, while the overall verification is\norchestrated by the direct execution of the scheduler. The approach is\noptimized by filtering the exploration of the scheduler with the integration of\npartial-order reduction. The technique, called ESST (Explicit Scheduler,\nSymbolic Threads) has been implemented and experimentally evaluated on a\nsignificant set of benchmarks. The results demonstrate that ESST technique is\nway more effective than software model checking applied to the sequentialized\nprograms, and that partial-order reduction can lead to further performance\nimprovements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 17:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 07:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

More\nspecifically, their proximity condition requires that in the target\n$k$-clustering, the projection of a point $x$ onto the line joining its cluster\ncenter $\\mu$ and some other center $\\mu'$, is a large additive factor closer to\n$\\mu$ than to $\\mu'$. This additive factor can be roughly described as $k$\ntimes the spectral norm of the matrix representing the differences between the\ngiven (known) dataset and the means of the (unknown) target clustering.\nClearly, the proximity condition implies center separation -- the distance\nbetween any two centers must be as large as the above mentioned bound.\n  In this paper we improve upon the work of Kumar and Kannan along several\naxes. First, we weaken the center separation bound by a factor of $\\sqrt{k}$,\nand secondly we weaken the proximity condition by a factor of $k$. Using these\nweaker bounds we still achieve the same guarantees when all points satisfy the\nproximity condition.

Here we show through simulation and theory that an adaptive pupil\nmask can be used to reduce these speckles and increase the visibility of faint\ncompanions. This is achieved by placing an adaptive mask in the conjugate pupil\nplane of the telescope. The mask consists of a number of independently\ncontrollable elements which can either allow the light in the subaperture to\npass or block it. This actively changes the shape of the telescope pupil and\nhence the diffraction pattern in the focal plane. By randomly blocking\nsubapertures we force the quasi-static speckles to become dynamic. The long\nexposure PSF is then smooth, absent of quasi-static speckles. However, as the\nPSF will now contain a larger halo due to the blocking, the signal to noise\nratio (SNR) is reduced requiring longer exposure times to detect the companion.\nFor example, in the specific case of a faint companion at 5xlambda/D the\nexposure time to achieve the same SNR will be increased by a factor of 1.35. In\naddition, we show that the visibility of companions can be greatly enhanced in\ncomparison to long-exposures, when the dark speckle method is applied to short\nexposure images taken with the adaptive pupil mask. We show that the contrast\nratio between PSF peak and the halo is then increased by a factor of\napproximately 100 (5 magnitudes), and we detect companions 11 magnitudes\nfainter than the star at 5xlambda/D and up to 18 magnitudes fainter at\n22.5xlambda/D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 19:41:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while\nsuper-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to\n\"forbidden\" zones in the M-R plane.

The synthetic radius distribution is\ncharacterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local\nmaximum at ~1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the\nincrease of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to\nthe fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets.

However, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport in\nstars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account in\nstellar models. To achieve a better understanding of these processes, we\ndesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,\nwhich until very recently were restricted to the Sun. In this paper, we report\nthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in the\ncore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giant\nKIC7341231, which was observed during one year with the Kepler spacecraft. By\nperforming an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show that\nits non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able to\ndetermine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. We then find a\nstellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismic\nproperties of the star. We use this model to perform inversions of the internal\nrotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of the\nstar is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. This will shed\nnew light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. In\nparticular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angular\nmomentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, which\ncould help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed over\nthe last decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 20:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

When seen edge-on the synchrotron emission from the Milky Way has\nan exponential scale-height of about 0.74 kpc, which is much smaller than the\nvalues obtained from previous models. We find that current analysis methods\noverestimate the scale-height of synchrotron emission of galaxies by about 10%\nat an inclination of 80 degree and about 40% at an inclination of 70 degree\nbecause of contamination from the disk.

UVOT photometry shows that while the optical photometry is\nconsistent with a large cool object, the near-ultraviolet (UV) photometry shows\nfar more UV flux than could be produced by any late-type object. Using model\nstellar atmospheres and a comparison to UVOT photometry for the pre-white dwarf\nPG 1159-035, we find that the companion has a temperature of at least 40,000 K\nand a radius of, at most, 0.056 R_sun. While the temperature and radius are\nconsistent with a hot compact stellar remnant, they are lower and larger,\nrespectively, than expected for a typical young pre-white dwarf.

We find that higher\ntemperatures more consistent with expectations for a pre-white dwarf can be\nderived if the foreground dust has a strong \"blue bump\" at 2175 AA and a lower\nR_V.

First, we develop a framework for\nthe theory of (local) nonstandard Lie groups and within that framework prove a\nnonstandard result that implies that a family of local Lie groups that converge\nin a pointwise sense must then differentiability converge, up to coordinate\nchange, to an analytic local Lie group, see corollary 6.1. The second result\nessentially says that a pair of mappings that almost satisfy the properties\ndefining a local Lie group must have a local Lie group nearby, see proposition\n7.1. Pairing the above two results, we get the principal standard consequence\nof the above work, corollary 7.2, which can be roughly described as follows. If\nwe have pointwise equicontinuous family of mapping pairs (potential local\nEuclidean topological group structures), pointwise approximating a (possibly\ndifferentiably unbounded) family of differentiable (suffi- ciently approximate)\nalmost groups, then the original family has, after appropriate coordinate\nchange, a local Lie group as a limit point.

The problem of\ndetermining the feasibility and stability of cooperation between rational nodes\nin a wireless network is of great importance in understanding cooperative\nbehavior. This paper addresses the stability of the grand coalition of\ntransmitters signaling over a multiple access channel using the framework of\ncooperative game theory. The external interference experienced by each TX is\nrepresented accurately by modeling the cooperation game between the TXs in\n\\emph{partition form}. Single user decoding and successive interference\ncancelling strategies are examined at the receiver. In the absence of\ncoordination costs, the grand coalition is shown to be \\emph{sum-rate optimal}\nfor both strategies. Transmitter cooperation is \\emph{stable}, if and only if\nthe core of the game (the set of all divisions of grand coalition utility such\nthat no coalition deviates) is nonempty. Determining the stability of\ncooperation is a co-NP-complete problem in general. For a single user decoding\nreceiver, transmitter cooperation is shown to be \\emph{stable} at both high and\nlow SNRs, while for an interference cancelling receiver with a fixed decoding\norder, cooperation is stable only at low SNRs and unstable at high SNR. When\ntime sharing is allowed between decoding orders, it is shown using an\napproximate lower bound to the utility function that TX cooperation is also\nstable at high SNRs. Thus, this paper demonstrates that ideal zero cost TX\ncooperation over a MAC is stable and improves achievable rates for each\nindividual user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 00:28:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 22:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Firstly, the original problem\nis transformed into an associated simpler equivalent problem with only\ninequality constraints. Then, inspired by the ideals of sequential quadratic\nprogramming (SQP) method and the method of system of linear equations (SLE), a\nnew type of SQP algorithm for solving the original problem is proposed. At each\niteration, the search direction is generated by the combination of two\ndirections, which are obtained by solving an always feasible quadratic\nprogramming (QP) subproblem and a SLE, respectively. Moreover, in order to\novercome the Maratos effect, the higher-order correction direction is obtained\nby solving another SLE.

We perform a systematic search for\nthe minimal field contents and gauge group representations of VL quarks able to\nsignificantly improve the fit of the measured Higgs rates, and simultaneously,\nto satisfy the direct constraints on VL quark masses as well as the\nelectro-weak precision tests. In particular, large enhancements can be achieved\nin certain diphoton channels - as pointed out by both the ATLAS and CMS\nCollaborations - optimizing then the Higgs rate fit. This is a consequence of\nthe introduction of VL quarks, with high electric charges of 8/3 or -7/3, which\nare exchanged in the Higgs-to-diphoton loop. Interestingly, the field contents\nand formal Higgs couplings obtained here are similar to those of scenarios in\nwarped/composite frameworks arising from different motivations.

We find that the static pair correlations of the large disks\nare only weakly perturbed by adding small disks. The higher-order static\ncorrelations of the large disks, by contrast, can be strongly affected. The\ncompressibility factor of the system first decreases and then increases upon\nincreasing the area fraction of the small disks and separating different\ncontributions to it allows to rationalize this non-monotonic phenomenon.\nFurthermore, adding small disks can influence dynamics of the system in\nquantitative and qualitative ways. For the large disks, the structural\nrelaxation time increases monotonically with increasing the area fraction of\nthe small disks at low and moderate area fractions of the large disks.

In online\nplanning, the agent focuses on its current state only, deliberates about the\nset of possible policies from that state onwards and, when interrupted, uses\nthe outcome of that exploratory deliberation to choose what action to perform\nnext. The performance of algorithms for online planning is assessed in terms of\nsimple regret, which is the agent's expected performance loss when the chosen\naction, rather than an optimal one, is followed.\n  To date, state-of-the-art algorithms for online planning in general MDPs are\neither best effort, or guarantee only polynomial-rate reduction of simple\nregret over time. Here we introduce a new Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm,\nBRUE, that guarantees exponential-rate reduction of simple regret and error\nprobability. This algorithm is based on a simple yet non-standard state-space\nsampling scheme, MCTS2e, in which different parts of each sample are dedicated\nto different exploratory objectives. Our empirical evaluation shows that BRUE\nnot only provides superior performance guarantees, but is also very effective\nin practice and favorably compares to state-of-the-art.

Our results show that the\nmotion of the knots is essentially ballistic, with the exception of the\nfarthest knots, which trace the large scale C-shape bending of the jet. The\nobserved bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30\nstar with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible\nproper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by\nthe red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can\nbe produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS\ncatalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more\nvariations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the\ncounterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by\nalmost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched\nsimultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities. We confirm that\nthe observed wiggling of the jet and counterjet arises from the orbital motion\nof the jet source in a binary system. Precession is of secondary importance in\nshaping the jet.

Comparison of static magnetic susceptibilities and local densities\nof states of two- and three-orbital models of a complete rotationally invariant\nCoulomb interaction and a \"density-density\" Hartree type interaction shows the\ndifferent role of spin-flip interactions for different band fillings. In the\nparticle-hole symmetric case the Mott-Hubbard physics dominates due to the\nstrong effective Coulomb interaction, while for the multiple electronic\nconfigurations away from half-filling (two electrons in the three band model)\nthe formation of local magnetic moments due to Hund's exchange interaction\nbecomes the most significant effect for itinerant magnetic systems. A shift of\nthe temperature of magnetic ordering due to the rotationally-invariant Hund's\nrule coupling is found to be the largest in a three-orbital model with a\ntwo-electron occupancy where the single particle spectrum is metallic and is\nnot sensitive to different forms of the Coulomb vertex. A larger enhancement of\nthe effective mass in a model with a rotationally-invariant interaction is\ndiscussed. In the half-filled case we find a drastic change in the density of\nstates close to the Mott transition which is related to the spin-flip Kondo\nfluctuations in a degenerate orbital case, while the corresponding shift of the\nmagnetic transition temperature is relatively small. It is shown that a change\nin the ground state degeneracy due to a different symmetry of the Coulomb\ninteraction in the density-density model leads to a breakdown of the\nquasiparticle peak at the Fermi level in the proximity of a Mott transition on\nthe metallic side. We discuss the relevance of rotationally-invariant Hund's\ninteraction in the transition metal magnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 10:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 15:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

Spectra of 401 red giant stars in a field at\n(l,b)=(0{\\deg},-10{\\deg}) were obtained with FLAMES at the VLT. Stars of\nluminosities down to below the two bulge red clumps (RCs) are included. From\nthese spectra we measure general metallicities, abundances of Fe and the\nalpha-elements, and radial velocities (RV) of the stars. These measurements as\nwell as photometric data are compared to simulations with the Besancon and\nTRILEGAL models of the Galaxy. We confirm the presence of two populations among\nour sample stars: i) a metal-rich one at [M/H] ~+0.3, comprising about 30% of\nthe sample, with low RV dispersion and low alpha-abundance, and ii) a\nmetal-poor population at [M/H] ~-0.6 with high RV dispersion and high\nalpha-abundance. The metal-rich population could be connected to the Galactic\nbar. We identify this population as the carrier of the double RC feature. We do\nnot find a significant difference in metallicity or RV between the two RCs, a\nsmall difference in metallicity being probably due to a selection effect. The\nRV dispersion agrees well with predictions of the Besancon Galaxy model, but\nthe metallicity of the \"thick bulge\" model component should be shifted to lower\nmetallicity by 0.2 to 0.3dex to well reproduce the observations.

Two types of coarse variables are considered. The\nfirst type consists of running finite time averages of phase functions.\nApproaches to construct the coarse evolution equation for this type are\ndiscussed and implemented on a 'Forced' Lorenz system and a singularly\nperturbed system whose fast flow does not necessarily converge to an\nequilibrium. We explore two strategies. In one, we compute (locally) invariant\nmanifolds of the fast dynamics, parameterized by the slow variables. In the\nother, the choice of our coarse variables automatically guarantees them to be\n'slow' in a precise sense. This allows their evolution to be phrased in terms\nof averaging utilizing limit measures (probability distributions) of the fast\nflow. Coarse evolution equations are constructed based on these approaches and\ntested against coarse response of the 'microscopic' models.

Of interest are undamped waves\nthat are the small amplitude limit of nonlinear excitations, such as electron\nacoustic waves (EAWs). A deviation consisting of a small plateau, a region with\nzero velocity derivative over a width that is a very small fraction of the\nelectron thermal speed, is shown to give rise to new undamped modes, which here\nare named {\\it corner modes}. The presence of the plateau turns off Landau\ndamping and allows oscillations with phase speeds within the plateau. These\nundamped waves are obtained in a wide region of the $(k,\\omega_{_R})$ plane\n($\\omega_{_R}$ being the real part of the wave frequency and $k$ the\nwavenumber), away from the well-known `thumb curve' for Langmuir waves and EAWs\nbased on the Maxwellian. Results of nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson simulations that\ncorroborate the existence of these modes are described. It is also shown that\ndeviations caused by fattening the tail of the distribution shift roots off of\nthe thumb curve toward lower $k$-values and chopping the tail shifts them\ntoward higher $k$-values. In addition, a rule of thumb is obtained for\nassessing how the existence of a plateau shifts roots off of the thumb curve.\nSuggestions are made for interpreting experimental observations of\nelectrostatic waves, such as recent ones in nonneutral plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 15:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The novel cascode-CE current reuse topology replaces\nthe traditional two stages topology so as to obtain low power consumption. The\nemitter degenerative inductor in input stage is adopted to achieve good input\nimpedance matching and noise performance.

We explain how functional currents can be\nequipped with a Hilbertian norm mixing geometrical and functional content of\nfunctional shapes nicely behaving under geometrical and functional\nperturbations and paving the way to various processing algorithms.

One of the key\nprinciples in protecting privacy is data minimisation. This principle requires\nthat only the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish a certain\ngoal is collected and processed. \"Privacy-enhancing\" communication protocols\nhave been proposed to guarantee data minimisation in a wide range of\napplications. However, currently there is no satisfactory way to assess and\ncompare the privacy they offer in a precise way: existing analyses are either\ntoo informal and high-level, or specific for one particular system. In this\nwork, we propose a general formal framework to analyse and compare\ncommunication protocols with respect to privacy by data minimisation. Privacy\nrequirements are formalised independent of a particular protocol in terms of\nthe knowledge of (coalitions of) actors in a three-layer model of personal\ninformation. These requirements are then verified automatically for particular\nprotocols by computing this knowledge from a description of their\ncommunication. We validate our framework in an identity management (IdM) case\nstudy. As IdM systems are used more and more to satisfy the increasing need for\nreliable on-line identification and authentication, privacy is becoming an\nincreasingly critical issue. We use our framework to analyse and compare four\nidentity management systems. Finally, we discuss the completeness and\n(re)usability of the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 12:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2013 14:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 11:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}
