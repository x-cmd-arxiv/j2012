The Kagome lattice\nexhibits an exotic band structure with three bands one of which can be made\ncompletely flat. The presence of artificial gauge fields allows to emulate\ntopological phases and induce chiral edge modes which can coexist inside the\nenergy gap with the flat band that is topologically trivial. By tuning the\nartificial fluxes or in the presence of disorder, the flat band can also\nacquire a bandwidth in energy allowing the coexistence between chiral edge\nmodes and bulk extended states; in this case the chiral modes become fragile\ntowards scattering into the bulk. The photonic system then exhibits equivalents\nof both a quantum Hall effect without Landau levels, and an anomalous Hall\neffect characterized by a non-quantized Chern number. We discuss experimental\nobservables such as local density of states and edge currents. We show how\nsynthetic uniform magnetic fields can be engineered, which allows an\nexperimental probe of Landau levels in the photonic Kagome lattice. We then\ndraw on semiclassical Boltzmann equations for transport to devise a method to\nmeasure Berry's phases around loops in the Brillouin zone.

This allows us to measure spectroscopic redshifts for a sample almost\ncomplete to K(AB)=21. COSMOS photometric redshifts are found in fair agreement\noverall with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a standard deviation of ~0.05;\nhowever, ~30% of objects have photometric redshifts systematically\nunderestimated by up to ~25%. We show that these systematic offsets in\nphotometric redshifts can be removed by using these objects as a training set.\nAll galaxies fall in four distinct redshift spikes at z=1.43, 1.53, 1.67 and\n1.82, with this latter one including 7 galaxies. SED fits to broad-band fluxes\nindicate stellar masses in the range of ~4-40x10^10Msun and that star formation\nwas quenched ~1 Gyr before the cosmic epoch at which they are observed.

Among various processes that measure\nsuch parton distribution functions, semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering is\nregarded as one of the golden channels to access transverse momentum dependent\nparton distribution functions, which provide a 3-D view of the nucleon\nstructure in momentum space. The Jefferson Lab experiment E06-010 focuses on\nmeasuring the target single and double spin asymmetries in the 3He(e, e'pi+,-)X\nreaction with a transversely polarized 3He target in Hall A with a 5.89 GeV\nelectron beam. A leading pion and the scattered electron are detected in\ncoincidence by the left High-Resolution Spectrometer at 16\\circ and the BigBite\nspectrometer at 30\\circ beam right, respectively. The kinematic coverage\nconcentrates in the valence quark region, x \\sim0.1-0.4, at Q2 \\sim 1-3 GeV2.\nThe Collins and Sivers asymmetries of 3He and neutron are extracted.

It is known that some of these stars are\nrunaways and therefore most likely were formed in embedded clusters and then\nejected into the field because of dynamical few-body interactions or\nbinary-supernova explosions. However, there exists a group of field O stars\nwhose runaway status is difficult to prove via direct proper motion\nmeasurements or whose low space velocities and/or young ages appear to be\nincompatible with their large separation from known star clusters. The\nexistence of this group led some authors to believe that field O stars can form\nin situ. In this paper, we examine the runaway status of the best candidates\nfor isolated formation of massive stars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic\nClouds by searching for bow shocks around them, by using the new reduction of\nthe Hipparcos data, and by searching for stellar systems from which they could\noriginate within their lifetimes. We show that most of the known O stars\nthought to have formed in isolation are instead very likely runaways. We show\nalso that the field must contain a population of O stars whose low space\nvelocities and/or young ages are in apparent contradiction with the large\nseparation of these stars from their parent clusters and/or the ages of these\nclusters. These stars (the descendants of runaway massive binaries) cannot be\ntraced back to their parent clusters and therefore can be mistakenly considered\nas having formed in situ. We argue also that some field O stars could be\ndetected in optical wavelengths only because they are runaways, while their\ncousins residing in the deeply embedded parent clusters might still remain\ntotally obscured. The main conclusion of our study is that there is no\nsignificant evidence whatsoever in support of the in situ proposal on the\norigin of massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 20:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

By\nexploiting deep photometric data from the CFHTLS, we probe the number of\ncompanions per BCG (Nc) with luminosity ratios down to those corresponding to\npotential minor mergers of 20:1. We also measure the average luminosity in\ncompanions per galaxy (Lc). We find that Nc and Lc rise steeply with luminosity\nratio for both the BCGs, and a control sample of other bright, red, cluster\ngalaxies. The trend for BCGs rises more steeply, resulting in a larger number\nof close companions. For companions within 50kpc of a BCG, Nc= 1.38+/-0.14 and\nLc=(2.14+/-0.31)x10^(10)L_sun and for companions within 50kpc of a luminosity\nmatched control sample of non-BCGs, Nc=0.87+/-0.08 and\nLc=(1.48+/-0.20)x10^(10)L_sun. This suggests that the BCGs are likely to\nundergo more mergers compared to otherwise comparable luminous galaxies.\nAdditionally, compared to a local sample of luminous red galaxies, the more\ndistant sample presented in this study (with redshifts between 0.15-0.39,)\nshows a higher Nc, suggesting the younger and smaller BCGs are still undergoing\nhierarchical formation. Using the Millennium Simulations we model and estimate\nthe level of contamination due to unrelated cluster galaxies. The contamination\nby interloping galaxies is 50% within projected separations of 50kpc, but\nwithin 30kpc, 60% of identified companions are real physical companions. We\nconclude that the luminosity of bound merger candidates down to luminosity\nratios of 20:1 could be adding as much as 10% to the mass of a typical BCG over\n0.5Gyr at redshifts of z~0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 20:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We also find a strong correlation of the L(FIR)/L(CO3-2) ratio with\nthe atomic to molecular gas mass ratio.

In\nthis work, the VUV light responses of the Gas Electron Multiplier and of the\nMicro-Hole Strip Plate, working with pure xenon, are simulated and studied in\ndetail using a new and versatile C++ toolkit. It is shown that the solid angle\nsubtended by a photosensor placed below the microstructures depends on the\noperating conditions. The obtained absolute EL yields, determined for different\ngas pressures and as functions of the applied voltage, are compared with those\ndetermined experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 01:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 19:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However, efficient cache\ninvalidation strategies are used to ensure the consistency between the data in\nthe cache of mobile clients and at the database server. Servers use\ninvalidation reports (IRs) to inform the mobile clients about data item\nupdates. This paper proposes and implements a multicast based strategy to\nmaintain cache consistency in mobile environment using AVI as the cache\ninvalidation scheme. The proposed algorithm is outlined as follows - To resolve\na query, the mobile client searches its cache to check if its data is valid. If\nyes, then query is answered, otherwise the client queries the DTA (Dynamic\nTransmitting Agent) for latest updates and the query is answered. If DTA\ndoesn't have the latest updates, it gets it from the server. So, the main idea\nhere is that DTA will be multicasting updates to the clients and hence the\nclients need not uplink to the server individually, thus preserving the network\nbandwidth. The scenario of simulation is developed in Java. The results\ndemonstrate that the traffic generated in the proposed multicast model is\nsimplified and it also retains cache consistency when compared to the existing\nmethods that used broadcast strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 05:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-11"}

Our approach is based on the theory, originally developed by the\nZvonkov and Timofeev [1], who used the paraxial approximation for the magnetic\nfield strength, but did not consider the slope of the magnetic field lines,\nwhich led to considerable error, as has been recently noted by Gospodchikov and\nSmolyakova [2].

The detection of gamma rays from star-forming galaxies by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) has allowed the determination of a functional\nrelationship between star formation rate and gamma-ray luminosity (Ackermann\net. al. 2012). Since star formation is known to scale with total infrared\n(8-1000 micrometers) and radio (1.4 GHz) luminosity, the observed infrared and\nradio emission from a star-forming galaxy can be used to quantitatively infer\nthe galaxy's gamma-ray luminosity. Similarly, star forming galaxies within\ngalaxy clusters allow us to derive lower limits on the gamma-ray emission from\nclusters, which have not yet been conclusively detected in gamma rays. In this\nstudy we apply the relationships between gamma-ray luminosity and radio and IR\nluminosities derived in Ackermann et. al. 2012 to a sample of galaxy clusters\nfrom Ackermann et. al. 2010 in order to place lower limits on the gamma-ray\nemission associated with star formation in galaxy clusters.

We evaluate the accretion rate onto\nthe NS of the material expelled from the explosion of the core progenitor as a\ntype Ib/c SN, and give the explicit expression of the accreted mass as a\nfunction of the nature of the components and binary parameters. We show that\nthe NS can reach, in a few seconds, the critical mass and consequently\ngravitationally collapses to a Black Hole. This gravitational collapse process\nleads to the emission of the GRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 07:35:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jun 2012 18:14:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 15:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}

It has been\nshown that the height of chalcogen atoms above Fe layers has significant effect\non band structure, electronic density of states (DOS) at Fermi level N(EF) and\nFermi surfaces. For FeSe the value of N(EF) is small so as to satisfy Stoner\ncriteria for ferromagnetism, (I\\timesN(EF)\\geq1) whereas for FeTe, since the\nvalue of N(EF) is large, the same is close to be satisfied.

The correlation is well defined (sigma=0.28dex) for disk galaxies\n(n_sersic<1.5), while more bulge-dominated objects often have lower specific\nSFRs. For disk galaxies, a much tighter correlation (sigma=0.19dex) is obtained\nif the rest-frame H-band luminosity is used instead of stellar mass derived\nfrom multicolor photometry. The specific SFR (sSFR) correlates strongly with\nrest-frame optical colors (hence luminosity-weighted stellar age) and also with\nclumpiness (which likely reflects the molecular gas fraction). This implies\nthat most of the observed scatter is real, despite its low level, and not\ndominated by random measurement errors. After correcting for these differential\neffects a remarkably small dispersion remains (sigma=0.14dex), suggesting that\nmeasurement errors in mass or SFR are ~0.10dex, excluding systematic\nuncertainties. Measurement errors in stellar masses, the thickening of the\ncorrelation due to real sSFR variations, and varying completeness with stellar\nmass, can spuriously bias the derived slope to lower values due to the finite\nrange over which observables (mass and SFR) are available. When accounting for\nthese effects, the intrinsic slope for the main sequence for disk galaxies gets\ncloser to unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 09:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The presence of correlated (red) noise in our data degrades the\nprecision by a factor ~1.3 with respect to a pure white noise regime. Based on\na detailed stellar variability analysis, a) we detected no transit-like events;\nb) we determined photometric rotation periods of ~0.47 days and ~0.22 days for\nLHS 3445 and GJ 1167A, respectively; c) these values agree with the large\nprojected rotational velocities (~25 km/s and ~33 km/s, respectively) inferred\nfor both stars based on the analysis of archival spectra; d) the estimated\ninclinations of the stellar rotation axes for LHS 3445 and GJ 1167A are\nconsistent with those derived using a simple spot model; e) short-term,\nlow-amplitude flaring events were recorded for LHS 3445 and LHS 2686.

The rms fluctuations of\nthe emitted intensity are about 0.6 (1.2) W/m2 ster pm near the core of the Ca\nIR line (Ca II H), corresponding to intensity fluctuations of about 20% (30%).\nFor the line wing, we find rms values of about 0.3 W/ m2 ster pm for both\nlines, corresponding to relative fluctuations below 5%. The rms shows a local\nminimum for wavelengths forming at about 130 km height, but otherwise increases\nfrom the wing to the core. The rms brightness temperature fluctuations are\nbelow 100 K for the photosphere and up to 500 K in the chromosphere. The\nskewness of the intensity distributions is close to zero in the outer line wing\nand positive throughout the rest of the spectrum. The skewness shows a\npronounced maximum on locations with photospheric magnetic fields for\nwavelengths in between the line wing and the line core, and a global maximum at\nthe very core for both magnetic and field-free locations. The energy content of\nthe intensity fluctuations is insufficient to create a similar temperature rise\nin the chromosphere as predicted in most reference models of the solar\natmosphere. The enhanced skewness between photosphere and lower solar\nchromosphere on magnetic locations indicates a mechanism which solely acts on\nmagnetized plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 13:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-14"}

Rotational modulation of Zeeman\nsignatures is clearly different between our 2 runs, demonstrating that\nlarge-scale fields of cTTSs are evolving with time and are likely produced by\nnon-stationary dynamo processes.\n  Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct maps of the large-scale field, of\nthe photospheric brightness & of the accretion-powered emission of GQ Lup.

The large-scale dipole of GQ Lup is however not strong enough to\ndisrupt the surrounding accretion disc further than about half-way to the\ncorotation radius, suggesting that GQ Lup should rapidly spin up like other\nsimilar partly-convective cTTSs (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 14:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Unfortunately, most CMB\nexperiments such as COBE, WMAP or Planck do not provide a direct measure of the\ncosmological signal; CMB is mixed up with galactic foregrounds and point\nsources. For the sake of scientific exploitation, measuring the CMB requires\nextracting several different astrophysical components (CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\nclusters, galactic dust) form multi-wavelength observations. Mathematically\nspeaking, the problem of disentangling the CMB map from the galactic\nforegrounds amounts to a component or source separation problem. In the field\nof CMB studies, a very large range of source separation methods have been\napplied which all differ from each other in the way they model the data and the\ncriteria they rely on to separate components. Two main difficulties are i) the\ninstrument's beam varies across frequencies and ii) the emission laws of most\nastrophysical components vary across pixels. This paper aims at introducing a\nvery accurate modeling of CMB data, based on sparsity, accounting for beams\nvariability across frequencies as well as spatial variations of the components'\nspectral characteristics. Based on this new sparse modeling of the data, a\nsparsity-based component separation method coined Local-Generalized\nMorphological Component Analysis (L-GMCA) is described. Extensive numerical\nexperiments have been carried out with simulated Planck data. These experiments\nshow the high efficiency of the proposed component separation methods to\nestimate a clean CMB map with a very low foreground contamination, which makes\nL-GMCA of prime interest for CMB studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 14:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,\nresponsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of\nmagnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars. While the former are too weak to create $B_s \\gtrsim 5\\times\n10^{13}$G$\\;\\gg B_d$, the ohmic decay time of the latter is much shorter than\n$10^6$ years. We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a\ntoroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where\nthe ohmic decay time exceeds $10^7$ years. This toroidal field may be created\nby various processes acting early in a neutron star's life. The Hall drift is a\nnon-linear mechanism that, due to the coupling between different components and\nscales, may be able to create the demanded strong, small scale, magnetic spots.\nTaking into account both realistic crustal microphysics and a minimal cooling\nscenario, we show that, in axial symmetry, these field structures are created\non a Hall time scale of $10^3$-$10^4$ years. These magnetic spots can be\nlong-lived, thereby fulfilling the pre-conditions for the appearance of the\nradio pulsar activity. Such magnetic structures created by the Hall drift are\nnot static, and dynamical variations on the Hall time scale are expected in the\npolar cap region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 15:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-11"}

The technical System we\nuse learns by interpreting an unknown word using the links created between this\nnew word and known words. The main link is provided by the context of the\nquery. When novice's query is confused with an unknown verb (goal) applied to a\nknown noun denoting either an object in the ideal user's Network or an object\nin the user's Network, the system infer that this new verb corresponds to one\nof the known goal. With the learning of new words in natural language as the\ninterpretation, which was produced in agreement with the user, the system\nimproves its representation scheme at each experiment with a new user and, in\naddition, takes advantage of previous discussions with users. The semantic Net\nof user objects thus obtained by learning is not always optimal because some\nrelationships between couple of user objects can be generalized and others\nsuppressed according to values of forces that characterize them. Indeed, to\nsimplify the obtained Net, we propose to proceed to an Inductive Bayesian\nAnalysis, on the Net obtained from Galois lattice. The objective of this\nanalysis can be seen as an operation of filtering of the obtained descriptive\ngraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 21:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

To select a fibre, the relationship\nbetween attenuation, temperature, and time has been analyzed together with SEM\nmicrographs. On the basis of these experiments, polyimide fibres have been\nchosen for utilisation. Further tests in ambient and inert atmosphere have been\nconducted with two polyimide coated fibres to set an operating temperature\nlimit for these fibres. SEM micrographs, together with coating colour changes\nhave been used to characterize the high temperature performance of the fibres.\nA novel cable design has been developed, a deployment strategy has been worked\nout and a suitable well for deployment has been selected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 08:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

In this paper we focus on two types of\nexamples: 1) Julia sets of cubic polynomials $z^3 + c$ with a single critical\npoint; 2) formal matings of quadratic Julia sets. The general scheme introduced\nin earlier papers in this series involves realizing the Julia set as a circle\nwith identifications, and attempting to obtain the Laplacian as a renormalized\nlimit of graph Laplacians on graphs derived form the circle with\nidentifications model. In the case of cubic Julia sets the details follows the\npattern established for quadratic Julia sets, but for matings the details are\nquite challenging, and we have only been completely successful for one example.\nOnce we have constructed the Laplacian, we are able to use numerical methods to\napproximate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. One striking observation from\nthe data is that for the cubic Julia sets the multiplicities of all eigenspaces\n(except for the trivial eigenspace of constants) are even numbers. Nothing like\nthis is valid for the quadratic julia sets studied earlier. We are able to\nexplain this, based on the fact that three is an odd number, and more precisely\nbecause the dihedral-3 symmetry group has only two distinct one-dimensional\nirreducible representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 02:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

Computers in such environments work in the\nbackground while establishing connections among them dynamically and hence will\nbe less visible and intrusive. Such a vision raises questions about how to\nmanage issues like privacy, trust and identity in those environments. In this\npaper, we review the technical challenges that face pervasive computing\nenvironments in relation to each of these issues. We then present a number of\nsecurity related considerations and use them as a basis for comparison between\npervasive and traditional computing. We will argue that these considerations\npose particular concerns and challenges to the design and implementation of\npervasive environments which are different to those usually found in\ntraditional computing environments. To address these concerns and challenges,\nfurther research is needed. We will present a number of directions and topics\nfor possible future research with respect to each of the three issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 18:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-01"}
