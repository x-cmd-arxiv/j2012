This formalism relies on the\nknowledge of the interaction kernel among quarks and of the full quark\npropagator. For the interaction kernel, which is in principle a sum of\ninfinitely many diagrams, I use the Ladder truncation. It amounts to reduce the\ninteraction to a flavor-blind quark-mass independent vector-vector interaction\nbetween two quarks, mediated by a dressed gluon. The irreducible three-body\ninteractions are neglected. The full quark propagator is obtained as a solution\nof the quark Dyson-Schwinger equation which is truncated such that, together\nwith the truncation in the interaction kernel, chiral symmetry is correctly\nimplemented. It is called Rainbow truncation, and together with the truncated\nkernel equation it constitutes the Rainbow-Ladder truncation of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation.\n  Any truncation induces the introduction of a model to account for the\nproperties of the full system. The main goal of this thesis is to evaluate the\nmodel dependence of corrsponding results and, as a consequence, to isolate the\nfeatures related to the truncation itself. To this end two non-related models\nare used to calculate the baryon spectra, from light to heavy quarks, and the\nelectromagnetic properties of the Delta(1232). From these results one concludes\na qualitative model independence, and that a Rainbow-Ladder truncated\nbound-state calculation reproduces the physical results with an accuracy of\n~10%.\n  Covariant bound-state equations are not limited to the study of hadronic\nbound states. As an example, in a further chapter of this thesis a\nBethe-Salpeter equation for glueballs is proposed, and the main steps for a\nconsistent resolution of the equation are described. However, to obtain this\nsolution is beyond the scope of this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 16:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-25"}

The velocity of uniform steady flow is found\nimplicitly from the acceleration function, and its linear stability criterion\ncan be expressed simply in terms of it. Crucially, unlike in previously\nanalyzed car-following models, the threshold of absolute stability does not\ngenerally coincide with an inflection point in the steady velocity function.\nThe Burgers and KdV equations can be derived under the usual assumptions, but\nthe mKdV equation arises only when absolute stability does coincide with an\ninflection point.

In general, if\na large non-Gaussian signal exists at the start of reheating, it will remain\nnon zero at the end of reheating. Unless all isocurvature modes have completely\ndecayed before the start of reheating, we find that the non-linearity\nparameter, f_NL, can be sensitive to the reheating timescale, and that this\ndependence is most appreciable for `runaway' inflationary potentials that only\nhave a minimum in one direction.

But the mechanisms behind the\noccurrence of large cloud outbursts and precipitation on Titan have been\ndisputed. A gobal- and annual-mean estimate of surface fluxes indicated only 1%\nof the insolation, or $\\sim$0.04 W/m$^2$, is exchanged as sensible and/or\nlatent fluxes. Since these fluxes are responsible for driving atmospheric\nconvection, it has been argued that moist convection should be quite rare and\nprecipitation even rarer, even if evaporation globally dominates the\nsurface-atmosphere energy exchange. In contrast, climate simulations that allow\natmospheric motion indicate a robust methane cycle with substantial cloud\nformation and/or precipitation. We argue the top-of-atmosphere radiative\nimbalance -- a readily observable quantity -- is diagnostic of horizontal heat\ntransport by Titan's atmosphere, and thus constrains the strength of the\nmethane cycle. Simple calculations show the top-of-atmosphere radiative\nimbalance is $\\sim$0.5-1 W/m$^2$ in Titan's equatorial region, which implies\n2-3 MW of latitudinal heat transport by the atmosphere. Our simulation of\nTitan's climate suggests this transport may occur primarily as latent heat,\nwith net evaporation at the equator and net accumulation at higher latitudes.\nThus the methane cycle could be 10-20 times previous estimates. Opposing\nseasonal transport at solstices, compensation by sensible heat transport, and\nfocusing of precipitation by large-scale dynamics could further enhance the\nlocal, instantaneous strength of Titan's methane cycle by a factor of several.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 16:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A decade earlier, J.B. Jackson and\nhis colleagues at Bell Labs were trying to understand the source of\nself-sustaining oscillations in digital filters. Some of the discrete mappings\nused to describe these filters show a remarkable ability to 'shadow' the\nTangent map when the polygon in question is regular.\n  In this paper we describe a specific digital filter map (Df) that appears to\nhave dynamics which are conjugate to the Tangent map for a regular N-gon with N\neven. When N is odd, there is evidence of another conjugacy between the Tangent\nmap dynamics of N and the matching 2N-gon, so a case like N = 7 can be studied\nwith the Df map in the context of N = 14. This provides a many-fold increase in\nefficiency, and also allows us to generalize the Tangent map to obtain 'step-k'\nversions - which have dynamics that are unexplored.\n  We also present some related maps, including Chua and Lin's 3-dimensional\nversion of Df, an Analog to Digital Converter from Orla Feely, a sawtooth\nversion of the Standard Map by Peter Ashwin and various kicked harmonic\noscillators. All of these seem to shadow the Tangent map in some form.\nMathematica code is provided for all mappings both here and at\nDynamicsOfPolygons.org.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 18:27:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 17:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 00:11:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 17:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 03:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 16:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-09"}

Intriguingly, the large scale field topology of a given pre-main\nsequence (PMS) star is strongly dependent upon the stellar internal structure,\nwith the strength of the dipole component of its multipolar magnetic field\ndecaying rapidly with the development of a radiative core. Using the\nobservational data as a basis, we argue that the general characteristics of the\nglobal magnetic field of a PMS star can be determined from its position in the\nHR diagram. Moving from hotter and more luminous to cooler and less luminous\nstars across the PMS of the HR diagram, we present evidence for four distinct\nmagnetic topology regimes. Stars with large radiative cores, empirically\nestimated to be those with a core mass in excess of ~40 per cent of the stellar\nmass, host highly complex and dominantly non-axisymmetric magnetic fields,\nwhile those with smaller radiative cores host axisymmetric fields with field\nmodes of higher order than the dipole dominant (typically, but not always, the\noctupole). Fully convective stars stars above ~0.5 MSun appear to host\ndominantly axisymmetric fields with strong (kilo-Gauss) dipole components.\nBased on similarities between the magnetic properties of PMS stars and main\nsequence M-dwarfs with similar internal structures, we speculate that a\nbistable dynamo process operates for lower mass stars (<~0.5 MSun at an age of\na few Myr) and that they will be found to host a variety of magnetic field\ntopologies.

We motivate supersymmetry by (1) gauge coupling unification, (2)\ndark matter, and (3) precision b-tau Yukawa unification. We show that for an\nLSP that is a bino-Higgsino admixture, these three requirements lead to an\nupper-bound on the stop and sbottom masses in the several TeV regime because\nthe threshold correction to the bottom mass at the superpartner scale is\nrequired to have a particular size.

For lower values of tan beta, the top and bottom squarks must be even\nlighter. Yukawa unification plus dark matter implies that superpartners are\nlikely in reach of the LHC, after the upgrade to 14 (or 13) TeV, independent of\nany considerations of naturalness. We present a model-independent, bottom-up\nanalysis of the SUSY parameter space that is simultaneously consistent with\nYukawa unification and the hint for m_h = 125 GeV. We study the flavor and dark\nmatter phenomenology that accompanies this Yukawa unification. A large portion\nof the parameter space predicts that the branching fraction for B_s to mu^+\nmu^- will be observed to be significantly lower than the SM value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper we use quantitative weak gravitational\nlensing measures to inform the precision of lens optical alignment, with\nspecific reference to the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We compute optics spot\ndiagrams and calculate the shear and flexion of the PSF as a function of\nposition on the focal plane. For perfect optical alignment we verify the high\nquality of the DES optical design, finding a maximum PSF contribution to the\nweak lensing shear of 0.04 near the edge of the focal plane. However this can\nbe increased by a factor of approximately three if the lenses are only just\naligned within their maximum specified tolerances. We calculate the E and\nB-mode shear and flexion variance as a function of de-centre or tilt of each\nlens in turn. We find tilt accuracy to be a few times more important than\nde-centre, depending on the lens considered. Finally we consider the compound\neffect of de-centre and tilt of multiple lenses simultaneously, by sampling\nfrom a plausible range of values of each parameter. We find that the compound\neffect can be around twice as detrimental as when considering any one lens\nalone. Furthermore, this combined effect changes the conclusions about which\nlens is most important to align accurately. For DES, the tilt of the first two\nlenses is the most important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 21:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We present our re-analyze the Kepler photometric dataset, searching for\nplanetary transits using an alternative processing pipeline to the one used by\nthe Kepler Mission.\n  Methods. The SARS pipeline was tested extensively by processing all available\nCoRoT data.

Although less than 1% of the Kepler dataset are KOIs we are able to\nsignificantly update the overall statistics of planetary multiplicity: we find\n84 new transit signals on 64 systems on these light curves only, nearly\ndoubling the number of transit signals in these systems. Forty-one of the\nsystems were singly-transiting systems that are now multiply-transiting.\nNotable among the new discoveries are KOI 435 as a new six-candidate system (of\nwhich kind only Kepler-11 was known before), KOI 277 (which includes two\ncandidates in a 6:7 resonance and anti-correlated transit timing variations) -\nall but validating the system, KOIs 719, 1574, and 1871 that have small planet\ncandidates (1.15, 2.05 and 1.71R_Earth) in the habitable zone of their host\nstar, and KOI 1843 that exhibits the shortest period (4.25hr) and among the\nsmallest (0.63 R_Earth) of all planet candidates.

We demonstrate that by an appropriate application of the\nscaling law, reliable interpolations can be used to accurately predict thermal\nconductivity of films and wires as a function of film thickness or wire radius\nat realistic length scales from molecular dynamics simulations. We apply this\nmethod to predict thermal conductivities for GaN wurtzite nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2012 03:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

However, using\nnetwork coding usually incurs high computational and storage costs in the\nnetwork devices and terminals. For example, some network coding schemes require\nthe computational and/or storage capacities of an intermediate network node to\nincrease linearly with the number of packets for transmission, making such\nschemes difficult to be implemented in a router-like device that has only\nconstant computational and storage capacities. In this paper, we introduce\nBATched Sparse code (BATS code), which enables a digital fountain approach to\nresolve the above issue. BATS code is a coding scheme that consists of an outer\ncode and an inner code. The outer code is a matrix generation of a fountain\ncode. It works with the inner code that comprises random linear coding at the\nintermediate network nodes. BATS codes preserve such desirable properties of\nfountain codes as ratelessness and low encoding/decoding complexity. The\ncomputational and storage capacities of the intermediate network nodes required\nfor applying BATS codes are independent of the number of packets for\ntransmission. Almost capacity-achieving BATS code schemes are devised for\nunicast networks, two-way relay networks, tree networks, a class of three-layer\nnetworks, and the butterfly network. For general networks, under different\noptimization criteria, guaranteed decoding rates for the receiving nodes can be\nobtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2012 07:02:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 08:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

All Z_M^R\nsymmetries are anomaly-free due to a non-trivial transformation of a\nGreen-Schwarz axion, and, as a consequence, a holomorphic mu term appears at\nthe non-perturbative level. There is a unique symmetry that is consistent with\nthe Weinberg operator while there is a class of Z_M^R symmetries which explain\nsuppressed Dirac neutrino masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2012 10:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 13:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate the\nsegregation energies for carbon within multiple grain boundary sites over a\ndatabase of 125 symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Fe.

Our technique is to use the results obtained from the 2D\npotential in order to find the initial conditions generating regular or chaotic\norbits in the 3D potential. Both 2D and 3D potentials display exact periodic\norbits together with extended chaotic regions. Numerical experiments suggest,\nthat the degree of chaos increases rapidly, as the energy of the test particle\nincreases. About 97% of the phase plane of the 2D system is covered by chaotic\norbits for large energies. The regular or chaotic character of the 2D orbits is\nchecked using the S(c) dynamical spectrum, while for the 3D potential we use\nthe S(c) spectrum, along with the P(f) spectral method. Comparison with other\ndynamical indicators shows that the S(c) spectrum gives fast and reliable\ninformation about the character of motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2012 14:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

Poltyrev's capacity for this\nchannel is the highest achievable NLD, at possibly large block length, that\nguarantees a vanishing error probability. For a given finite block length n and\na fixed error probability, there is a gap between the highest achievable NLD\nand Poltyrev's capacity.

In such a scenario, while the stau is the\nnext-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), the charginos and the other\nneutralinos as well as sleptons of the first two families are also likely to be\nnot too far above the mass bounds laid down by the Large Electron Positron\n(LEP) collider. As the branching ratios of decays of the charginos and the\nnext-to-lightest neutralino into staus are rather large, one expects\nsignificant rates of tau-rich final states in such a case.

The associated signal rates for these channels\nare computed, for the centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV.
