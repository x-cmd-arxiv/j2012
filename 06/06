However, there are a number of new problems in remote sensing and\nclassification of buried compact metallic targets that require a wider class of\nsolutions that, if not exact, at least support rapid numerical evaluation.\nHere, the exact Chandrasekhar theory of the electrostatics of heterogeneously\ncharged \\emph{ellipsoids} is used to develop a \"mean field\" perturbation theory\nof low frequency electrodynamics of highly conducting ellipsoidal targets, in\ninsulating or weakly conducting backgrounds. The theory is based formally on an\nexpansion in the parameter $\\eta_s = L_s/\\delta_s(\\omega)$, where $L_s$ is the\ncharacteristic linear size of the scatterer and $\\delta_s(\\omega)$ is the\nelectromagnetic skin depth. The theory is then extended to a numerically\nefficient description of the intermediate-to-late-time dynamics following an\nexcitation pulse. As verified via comparisons with experimental data taken\nusing artificial spheroidal targets, when combined with a previously developed\ntheory of the high frequency, early-time regime, these results serve to cover\nthe entire dynamic range encountered in typical measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 16:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-06"}

To date, observations from\nthe X-Ray Sensor (XRS) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite (GOES) have been used to derive these properties, but have been\nlimited by a number of factors, including the lack of a consistent background\nsubtraction method capable of being automatically applied to large numbers of\nflares. In this paper, we describe an automated temperature and emission\nmeasure-based background subtraction method (TEBBS), which builds on the\nmethods of Bornmann (1990). Our algorithm ensures that the derived temperature\nis always greater than the instrumental limit and the pre-flare background\ntemperature, and that the temperature and emission measure are increasing\nduring the flare rise phase. Additionally, TEBBS utilizes the improved\nestimates of GOES temperatures and emission measures from White et al. (2005).\nTEBBS was successfully applied to over 50,000 solar flares occurring over\nnearly three solar cycles (1980-2007), and used to create an extensive catalog\nof the solar flare thermal properties. We confirm that the peak emission\nmeasure and total radiative losses scale with background subtracted GOES X-ray\nflux as power-laws, while the peak temperature scales logarithmically. As\nexpected, the peak emission measure shows an increasing trend with peak\ntemperature, although the total radiative losses do not. While these results\nare comparable to previous studies, we find that flares of a given GOES class\nhave lower peak temperatures and higher peak emission measures than previously\nreported. The resulting TEBBS database of thermal flare plasma properties is\npublicly available on Solar Monitor (www.solarmonitor.org/TEBBS/) and will be\navailable on Heliophysics Integrated Observatory (www.helio-vo.eu).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 17:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 19:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-07"}

Finally, we formulate a\ngeneralized version of the algorithm that can also be applied outside the\ncontext of chemistry and origin of life, which we illustrate with a toy example\nfrom economics.\n  Conclusions: Having shown theoretically (in previous work) that autocatalytic\nsets are highly likely to exist, we conclude here that also in terms of\ndynamics such sets are viable and outcompete non-autocatalytic sets.\nFurthermore, our dynamical results confirm arguments made earlier about how\nautocatalytic subsets can enable their own growth or give rise to other such\nsubsets coming into existence. Finally, our algorithmic extension and\ngeneralization show that more realistic scenarios (e.g., including inhibition)\ncan also be dealt with within our framework, and that it can even be applied to\nareas outside of chemistry, such as economics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 18:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-06"}

Commonly used independence\nscreening methods are based on marginal correlations or variations of it. In\nmany applications, researchers often have some prior knowledge that a certain\nset of variables is related to the response. In such a situation, a natural\nassessment on the relative importance of the other predictors is the\nconditional contributions of the individual predictors in presence of the known\nset of variables. This results in conditional sure independence screening\n(CSIS). Conditioning helps for reducing the false positive and the false\nnegative rates in the variable selection process. In this paper, we propose and\nstudy CSIS in the context of generalized linear models. For\nultrahigh-dimensional statistical problems, we give conditions under which sure\nscreening is possible and derive an upper bound on the number of selected\nvariables.

The leader in this proliferation is what is known as\nexplosive percolation. A recent proof demonstrates that a large class of\nexplosive percolation-type models does not, in fact, exhibit a discontinuous\ntransition[O. Riordan and L. Warnke, Science, {\\bf 333}, 322 (2011)]. We, on\nthe other hand, discuss several correlated percolation models, the $k$-core\nmodel on random graphs, and the spiral and counter-balance models in\ntwo-dimensions, all exhibiting discontinuous transitions in an effort to\nidentify the needed ingredients for such a transition. We then construct\nmixtures of these models to interpolate between a continuous transition and a\ndiscontinuous transition to search for a tricritical point. Using a powerful\nrate equation approach, we demonstrate that a mixture of $k=2$-core and\n$k=3$-core vertices on the random graph exhibits a tricritical point. However,\nfor a mixture of $k$-core and counter-balance vertices, heuristic arguments and\nnumerics suggest that there is a line of continuous transitions as the fraction\nof counter-balance vertices is increased from zero with the line ending at a\ndiscontinuous transition only when all vertices are counter-balance.

Here we\npresent three adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations that\nillustrate the impact of momentum transfer from ionising radiation to the\nabsorbing gas on star formation in high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Momentum\ntransfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a ray\ntracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. We find\nthat momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing the\nturbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular\nvelocity of early haloes. Compared to a calculation that neglects radiation\npressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of five to 1.8 x\n10^{-2} Msun/yr in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 x\n10^8 and 4.5 x 10^5 solar masses, respectively, when radiation pressure is\nincluded. Its mean metallicity of 10^{-2.1} Z_sun is consistent with the\nobserved dwarf galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation. However, what one may\nnaively expect from the calculation without radiation pressure, the central\nregion of the galaxy overcools and produces a compact, metal-rich stellar\npopulation with an average metallicity of 0.3 Z_sun, indicative of an incorrect\nphysical recipe. In addition to photo-heating in HII regions, radiation\npressure further drives dense gas from star forming regions, so supernovae\nfeedback occurs in a warmer and more diffuse medium, launching metal-rich\noutflows. Capturing this aspect and a temporal separation between the start of\nradiative and supernova feedback are numerically important in the modeling of\ngalaxies to avoid the \"overcooling problem\".

These neutrinos can also be produced by oscillations of the active\nneutrinos in the early universe, leaving possible traces on different\ncosmological observables. Here we perform an updated study of the neutrino\nkinetic equations in (3+1) and (2+1) oscillation schemes, dynamically evolving\nprimordial asymmetries of active neutrinos and taking into account for the\nfirst time CP-violation effects. In the absence of neutrino asymmetries,\neV-mass scale sterile neutrinos would be completely thermalized creating a\ntension with respect to the CMB, LSS and BBN data. In the past literature,\nactive neutrino asymmetries have been invoked as a way to inhibit the sterile\nneutrino production via the in-medium suppression of the sterile-active mixing\nangle. However, neutrino asymmetries also permit a resonant sterile neutrino\nproduction. We find that if the active species have equal asymmetries L, a\nvalue |L|=10^{-3} is required to start suppressing the resonant sterile\nproduction, roughly an order of magnitude larger than what previously expected.\nWhen active species have opposite asymmetries the sterile abundance is further\nenhanced, requiring an even larger |L|\\simeq 10^{-2} to start suppressing their\nproduction. In the latter case, CP-violation (naturally expected) further\nexacerbates the phenomenon. Some consequences for cosmological observables are\nbriefly discussed: for example, it is likely that moderate suppressions of the\nsterile species production are associated with significant spectral distortions\nof the active neutrino species, with potentially interesting phenomenological\nconsequences especially for BBN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 11:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

In addition, we have\ninvestigated whether the kinematics of the highest mass white dwarfs\n(>0.95Msun) are consistent with the expected relative contributions of single\nstar evolution and mergers. We find that the kinematics are consistent with the\nmajority of high-mass white dwarfs being formed through single star evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 20:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The stochastic adaptation\nrule was employed in order to control the balancing between exploration and\nexploitation. This MABC algorithm was applied to a Special suite on Large Scale\nContinuous Global Optimization at the 2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary\nComputation. The obtained results the MABC are comparable with the results of\nDECC-G, DECC-G*, and MLCC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 21:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In recent years, there has\nbeen a lot of interest in the physical interference model based on SINR\nconstraints. Distributed algorithms are especially challenging in the SINR\nmodel, because of the non-locality of the model.\n  In this paper, we develop a fast distributed approximation algorithm for MST\nconstruction in an SINR based distributed computing model. For an $n$-node\nnetwork, our algorithm's running time is $O(D\\log{n}+\\mu\\log{n})$ and produces\na spanning tree whose cost is within $O(\\log n)$ times the optimal (MST cost),\nwhere $D$ denotes the diameter of the disk graph obtained by using the maximum\npossible transmission range, and $\\mu=\\log{\\frac{d_{max}}{d_{min}}}$ denotes\nthe \"distance diversity\" w.r.t. the largest and smallest distances between two\nnodes. (When $\\frac{d_{max}}{d_{min}}$ is $n$-polynomial, $\\mu = O(\\log n)$.)\nOur algorithm's running time is essentially optimal (upto a logarithmic\nfactor), since computing {\\em any} spanning tree takes $\\Omega(D)$ time; thus\nour algorithm produces a low cost spanning tree in time only a logarithmic\nfactor more than the time to compute a spanning tree. The distributed\nscheduling complexity of the spanning tree resulted from our algorithm is\n$O(\\mu \\log n)$. Our algorithmic design techniques can be useful in designing\nefficient distributed algorithms for related \"global\" problems in wireless\nnetworks in the SINR model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 03:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-07"}

While the triple alpha process is normally not effective in BBN,\nits rate is very sensitive to the position of the \"Hoyle state\" and could in\nprinciple be drastically affected if Be-8 were stable during BBN. The nuclear\nproperties (resonance energies in He-5 and Li-5 nuclei, and the binding\nenergies of Be-8 and D) are all computed in a consistent way using a\nmicroscopic cluster model. The n(p,gamma)d, He3(d,p)He4 and H3(d,n)He4 and\ntriple-alpha reaction rates are subsequently calculated as a function of the\nnucleon-nucleon interaction that can be related to the fundamental constants.\nWe found that the effect of the variation of constants on the He3(d,p)He4 and\nH3(d,n)He4 and triple-alpha reaction rates is not sufficient to induce a\nsignificant effect on BBN, even if Be-8 was stable.

We find that, for essentially the full range of\nparameters either observationally determined or yielded by numerical\nsimulations, the combination of dark matter and star distribution can be very\nwell described, for lens radii relevant to strong lensing, by a simple\npower-law whose slope is very weakly dependent on the parameters characterizing\nthe global matter surface density profile and close to isothermal in agreement\nwith direct estimates for individual lens galaxies. Our simple treatment allows\nan easy insight into the role of the different ingredients that determine the\nlens cross section and the distribution of gravitational amplifications.

Therefore, the high memory usage is often a major problem for topic\nmodeling of massive corpora containing a large number of topics. To reduce the\nspace complexity, we propose a novel algorithm without storing previous\nmessages for training LDA: tiny belief propagation (TBP). The basic idea of TBP\nrelates the message passing algorithms with the non-negative matrix\nfactorization (NMF) algorithms, which absorb the message updating into the\nmessage passing process, and thus avoid storing previous messages. Experimental\nresults on four large data sets confirm that TBP performs comparably well or\neven better than current state-of-the-art training algorithms for LDA but with\na much less memory consumption.

In seeking inspirations for such designs, many\nengineers are turning toward the biological world to correlate surface\nstructure to functional behavior of bio-analogues. From a tribological point of\nview, squamate reptiles offer diverse examples where surface texturing,\nsubmicron and nano-scale features, achieve frictional regulation. In this\npaper, we study the frictional response of shed skin obtained from a snake\n(Python regius). The study employed a specially designed tribo-acoustic probe\ncapable of measuring the coefficient of friction and detecting the acoustical\nbehavior of the skin in vivo. The results confirm the anisotropy of the\nfrictional response of snakes. The coefficient of friction depends on the\ndirection of sliding: the value in forward motion is lower than that in the\nbackward direction. In addition it is shown that the anisotropy of the\nfrictional response may stem from profile asymmetry of the individual fibril\nstructures present within the ventral scales of the reptile\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 08:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-07"}

We present experimental and image\nreconstruction methods with which 2-D SOS distributions can be accurately\nacquired and reconstructed, and with which the SOS map can be used subsequently\nto reconstruct highly accurate PA tomograms. We begin with a 2-D iterative\nreconstruction approach in an ultrasound transmission tomography (UTT) setting,\nwhich uses ray refracted paths instead of straight ray paths to recover\naccurate SOS images of the subject. Subsequently, we use the SOS distribution\nin a new 2-D iterative approach, where refraction of rays originating from PA\nsources are accounted for in accurately retrieving the distribution of these\nsources. Both the SOS reconstruction and SOS-compensated PA reconstruction\nmethods utilize the Eikonal equation to model acoustic wavefront propagation,\nwhich is solved using a high accuracy fast marching method (HAFMM). We validate\nthe new reconstruction algorithms using numerical phantoms. For experiments we\nuse the PER-PACT method which can be used to simultaneously acquire SOS and PA\ndata from subjects. We test the reconstruction algorithms using experimental\ndata acquired with the PER-PACT setup from challenging physical phantoms. The\nresults show that it is important to take SOS inhomogeneities into account. The\niterative reconstruction algorithms, that model acoustic refractive effects,\nyield artifact-free highly accurate images. Our approach of using the hybrid\nmeasurement method and the new reconstruction algorithms, is successful in\nsubstantially improving the quality of PA images with a minimization of\nblurring and artefacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 11:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 12:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}

The shortest-period binary consists of two M4\ntype stars in a P=0.112 day orbit. The binaries are discovered as part of an\nextensive search for short-period eclipsing systems in over 260,000 stellar\nlightcurves, including over 10,000 M-dwarfs down to J=18 mag, yielding 25\nbinaries with P<0.23 days.

The local\nstructure of graphene is modeled by a planar hydrocarbon cluster\n(C$_{24}$H$_{12}$). Systematic treatment of the electron correlations and the\npossibility to study excited states allow us to reproduce the potential energy\ncurves for different electronic configurations of Co. We find that upon\napproaching the surface, the ground-state configuration of Co undergoes several\ntransitions, giving rise to two stable states. The first corresponds to the\nphysisorption of the adatom in the high-spin $3d^74s^2$ ($S=3/2$)\nconfiguration, while the second results from the chemical bonding formed by\nstrong orbital hybridization, leading to the low-spin $3d^9$ ($S=1/2$) state.\nDue to the instability of the $3d^9$ configuration, the adsorption energy of Co\nis small in both cases and does not exceed 0.35 eV. We analyze the obtained\nresults in terms of a simple model Hamiltonian that involves Coulomb repulsion\n($U$) and exchange coupling ($J$) parameters for the 3$d$ shell of Co, which we\nestimate from first-principles calculations. We show that while the exchange\ninteraction remains constant upon adsorption ($\\simeq1.1$ eV), the Coulomb\nrepulsion significantly reduces for decreasing distances (from 5.3 to\n2.6$\\pm$0.2 eV). The screening of $U$ favors higher occupations of the 3$d$\nshell and thus is largely responsible for the interconfigurational transitions\nof Co.

The contagion\nindex makes it possible to quantify the effect that an exceedance above a high\nthreshold can have on a region. The stability index reflects the expected\nnumber of crossings of a high threshold in a region associated to a specific\nlocation i, given the occurrence of at least one crossing at that location. We\nwill find some relations with well-known extremal dependence measures found in\nthe literature, which will provide immediate estimators. For these estimators\nan application to the annual maxima precipitation in Portuguese regions is\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 13:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-07"}

Yet, the theory has\nbeen confirmed only until Small Magellanic Cloud metallicities. Analyses of\nO-stars at lower metallicities are needed to prove the theory. Aims. We have\nobserved GHV-62024, an O6.5 IIIf star in the low-metallicity galaxy IC1613.\nAccording to a previous preliminary analysis this star could challenge the\nradiatively driven wind theory at low metallicities. Methods. Our observations\nwere obtained with VIMOS at VLT, at R~2000 and were analysed using the latest\nversion of the model atmosphere code FASTWIND, which includes N III Results. We\nobtain the stellar parameters and conclude that the star follows the average\nwind momentum-luminosity relationship (WLR) expected for its metallicity, but\nwith a high value for the exponent of the wind velocity law, beta. We suggest\nthat this high value may be reached because GHV-62024 could be a fast rotator\nseen at a low inclination angle. While the derived beta value does not change\nby adopting a lower wind terminal velocity, a wrong $V_\\infty$ has a clear\nimpact on the position of the star in the WLR diagram. The N and He abundances\nare very high, consistent with strong CNO mixing that could have been caused by\nthe fast rotation, although we cannot discard a different origin. We find again\nthe well-known mass-discrepancy. Conclusions. We conclude that the star follows\nthe WLR expected for its metallicity. The results are consistent with GHV-62024\nbeing a fast rotator seen close to pole-on, contaminated at the surface with\nCNO products and with a wind structure altered by the fast rotation without\nmodifying the global WLR. We suggest that this could be a general property of\nfast rotators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 14:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Mon R2 is the only ultracompact HII region (UCHII) where the\nassociated photon-dominated region (PDR) can be resolved with Herschel. Due to\nits brightness and proximity, it is the best source to investigate the\nchemistry and physics of highly UV-irradiated PDRs. Aims. Our goal is to\nestimate the abundance of H2O and NH3 in this region and investigate their\norigin. Methods. We present new observations obtained with HIFI and the\nIRAM-30m telescope. Using a large velocity gradient approach, we model the line\nintensities and derive an average abundance of H2O and NH3 across the region.\nFinally, we model the line profiles with a non-local radiative transfer model\nand compare these results with the abundance predicted by the Meudon PDR code.\nResults. The variations of the line profiles and intensities indicate complex\ngeometrical and kinematical patterns. The H2O lines present a strong absorption\nat the ambient velocity and emission in high velocity wings towards the HII\nregion. The spatial distribution of the o-H2^18O line shows that the its\nemission arises in the PDR surrounding the HII region. By modeling the o-H2^18O\nemission we derive a mean abundance of o-H2O of ~10^-8 relative to H2. The\northo-H2O abundance is however larger, ~1x10^-7, in the high velocity wings.\nPossible explanations for this larger abundance include an expanding hot PDR\nand/or an outflow. Ammonia seems to be present only in the envelope with an\naverage abundance of ~2x10^-9 relative to H2. Conclusions. The Meudon PDR code\ncan account for the measured water abundance in the high velocity gas as long\nas we assume that it originates from a <1 mag hot expanding layer of the PDR,\ni.e. that the outflow has only a minor contribution to this emission. To\nexplain the abundances in the rest of the cloud the molecular freeze out and\ngrain surface chemistry would need to be included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2012 14:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 15:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The electromagnetic and weak meson currents are extracted\nfrom the 1-$\\gamma$ and 1-$W$-exchange amplitudes that result from a\nBakamjian-Thomas type mass operator for the respective systems. The covariant\ndecomposition of these currents provides the electromagnetic and weak\n(transition) form factors.
