There have been a growing number of papers investigating C\nand H as possible light elements in the core, but the results are\ncontradictory. Here, using ab initio simulations, we study the Fe-C and Fe-H\nsystems at inner core pressures (330-364 GPa). Using the evolutionary structure\nprediction algorithm USPEX, we have determined the lowest-enthalpy structures\nof possible carbides (FeC, Fe2C, Fe3C, Fe4C, FeC2, FeC3, FeC4 and Fe7C3) and\nhydrides (Fe4H, Fe3H, Fe2H, FeH, FeH2, FeH3, FeH4) and have found that Fe2C\n(Pnma) is the most stable iron carbide at pressures of the inner core, while\nFeH, FeH3 and FeH4 are stable iron hydrides at these conditions. For Fe3C, the\ncementite structure (Pnma) and the Cmcm structure recently found by random\nsampling are less stable than the I-4 and C2/m structures found here. We found\nthat FeH3 and FeH4 adopt chemically interesting thermodynamically stable\nstructures, in both compounds containing trivalent iron. The density of the\ninner core can be matched with a reasonable concentration of carbon, 11-15\nmol.percent (2.6-3.7 wt.percent) at relevant pressures and temperatures. This\nconcentration matches that in CI carbonaceous chondrites and corresponds to the\naverage atomic mass in the range 49.3-51.0, in close agreement with inferences\nfrom the Birch's law for the inner core.

Unlike the traditional web\nads, the advertiser's profits for group-buying ads depends on the time to\nexpiry and additional customers needed to satisfy the minimum group size. Since\nboth these quantities are time-dependent, optimal bid amounts to maximize\nprofits change with every impression. Consequently, traditional static bidding\nstrategies are far from optimal. Instead, bid values need to be optimized in\nreal-time to maximize expected bidder profits. This online optimization of deal\nprofits is made possible by the advent of ad exchanges offering real-time\n(spot) bidding. To this end, we propose a real-time bidding strategy for\ngroup-buying deals based on the online optimization of bid values. We derive\nthe expected bidder profit of deals as a function of the bid amounts, and\ndynamically vary bids to maximize profits. Further, to satisfy time constraints\nof the online bidding, we present methods of minimizing computation timings.\nSubsequently, we derive the real time ad selection, admissibility, and real\ntime bidding of the traditional ads as the special cases of the proposed\nmethod. We evaluate the proposed bidding, selection and admission strategies on\na multi-million click stream of 935 ads. The proposed real-time bidding,\nselection and admissibility show significant profit increases over the existing\nstrategies.

The QPO is observed only at the beginning of the 2010 and 2011\noutbursts at similar hard colour and intensity, suggestive of an accretion\nstate dependence for the QPO. Although its frequency appears to be correlated\nwith X-ray intensity on timescales of a day, in successive outbursts eight\nmonths apart we measure a QPO frequency that differs by less than ~2.2 mHz\nwhile the intensity had changed significantly. We show that this ~11 mHz QPO is\ndifferent from the so-called Type-C QPOs seen in black holes and that the\nmechanisms that produce the two flavours of variability are most probably\nindependent. After comparing this QPO with other variability phenomena seen in\naccreting black holes and neutron stars, we conclude that it best resembles the\nso-called \"1 Hz\" QPOs seen in dipping neutron star systems, although having a\nsignificantly lower (1-2 orders of magnitude) frequency. If confirmed,\nH1743-322 is the first black hole showing this type of variability. Given the\nunusual characteristics and the hard-state dependence of the ~11 mHz QPO, we\nalso speculate whether these oscillations could instead be related to the radio\njets observed in H1743-322. A systematic search for this type of low-frequency\nQPOs in similar systems is needed to test this speculation. In any case, it\nremains unexplained why these QPOs have only been seen in the last two\noutbursts of H1743-322.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2012 18:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However, discounting does not work\nin all financially relevant situations, typically when the eligible asset is a\ndefaultable bond. In this paper we fill this gap allowing for general eligible\nassets. We provide a variety of finiteness and continuity results for the\ncorresponding risk measures and apply them to risk measures based on\nValue-at-Risk and Tail Value-at-Risk on $L^p$ spaces, as well as to shortfall\nrisk measures on Orlicz spaces.

Finally, we consider the situation where the eligible asset is not\nliquidly traded and the pricing rule is no longer linear.

Its main contributions are (1) a birational parametrization for every\nsuch HMM, with an explicit inverse for recovering the hidden parameters in\nterms of observables, (2) a semialgebraic model membership test for every such\nHMM, and (3) minimal defining equations for the 4-node fully binary model,\ncomprising 21 quadrics and 29 cubics, which were computed using Grobner bases\nin the cumulant coordinates of Sturmfels and Zwiernik.

In\nanswer to the question of Petersen, we observe a connection between the sorting\nindex and the B-code of a permutation defined by Foata and Han, and we show\nthat the bijection of Foata and Han serves the purpose of mapping\n$(inv,rl\\textrm{-}min)$ to $(sor,cyc)$.

Different\nfrom free-standing graphene, the hybridization between graphene and Mn/SiC\nleads to the formation of a dispersive Dirac cone of primarily TM d characters.\nThe corresponding Dirac spectrum is still isotropic, and the transport behavior\nis nearly identical to that of free-standing graphene for a bias as large as\n0.6 V, except that the Fermi velocity is half that of graphene. A simple model\nHamiltonian is developed to qualitatively account for the physics of the\ntransfer of the Dirac cone from a dispersive system (e.g., graphene) to an\noriginally non-dispersive system (e.g., TM).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 03:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}

In particular, we introduce a technique for drawing planar\ngraphs with a fixed vertex mapping that bounds the number of times edges bend.\nAn immediate consequence of this technique is that any planar graph can be\ndrawn with a fixed vertex mapping so that edges map to piecewise linear curves\nwith at most $3n + O(1)$ bends each. By considering uniformly random planar\ngraphs, we show that $2n + O(1)$ bends per edge is sufficient on average.\n  To further utilize our technique, we consider simultaneous embeddings of $k$\nuniformly random planar graphs with vertices mapping to a fixed, common point\nset. We explain how to achieve such a drawing so that edges map to piecewise\nlinear curves with $O(n^{1-1/k})$ bends each, which holds with overwhelming\nprobability. This result improves upon the previously best known result of O(n)\nbends per edge for the case where $k \\geq 2$.

LS I +61 303 is a member of the select group of gamma-ray binaries:\ngalactic binary systems that contain a massive star and a compact object, show\na changing milliarcsecond morphology and a similar broad spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) that peaks at MeV-TeV energies and is modulated by the\norbital motion.

This leads to drastic changes in quantities which rely on interband\nmixing induced by the spin-orbit interaction. The anisotropy is particularly\nstriking for quantities which exhibit spiky and irregular distribution in the\nBrillouin zone, such as the spin-mixing parameter or the Berry curvature of the\nelectronic states. We demonstrate this for three cases: (i) the Elliott-Yafet\nspin-relaxation mechanism in paramagnets with structural inversion symmetry;\n(ii) the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnets; and (iii) the spin\nHall effect in paramagnets.

The prominence of EB is primarily attributed to its asymptotic\nthroughput stability, which ensures a non-zero throughput even when the number\nof users in the network goes to infinity. Recent studies, however, show that EB\nis fundamentally unsuitable for applications that are sensitive to large delay\nand delay jitters, as it induces divergent second- and higher-order moments of\nmedium access delay. Essentially, the medium access delay follows a power law\ndistribution, a subclass of heavy-tailed distribution. To understand and\nalleviate the issue, this paper systematically analyzes the tail delay\ndistribution of general backoff functions, with EB being a special case. In\nparticular, we establish a tradeoff between the tail decaying rate of medium\naccess delay distribution and the stability of throughput. To be more specific,\nconvergent delay moments are attainable only when the backoff functions $g(k)$\ngrows slower than exponential functions, i.e., when $g(k)\\in o(r^k)$ for all\n$r>1$. On the other hand, non-zero asymptotic throughput is attainable only\nwhen backoff functions grow at least as fast as an exponential function, i.e.,\n$g(k)\\in\\Omega(r^k)$ for some $r>1$. This implies that bounded delay moments\nand stable throughput cannot be achieved at the same time. For practical\nimplementation, we show that polynomial backoff (PB), where $g(k)$ is a\npolynomial that grows slower than exponential functions, obtains finite delay\nmoments and good throughput performance at the same time within a practical\nrange of user population. This makes PB a better alternative than EB for\nmultimedia applications with stringent delay requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2012 15:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 12:30:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 07:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}
