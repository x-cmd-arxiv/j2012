High-resolution spectroscopy of the\nhost star yields T_eff = 6427 +/- 33 K, log(g) = 4.52 +/- 0.14, and\n[Fe/H]=-0.04 +/- 0.05. These parameters, combined with the broad-band spectral\nenergy distribution and parallax, allow us to infer a mass and radius of the\nhost star of M_1=1.21 +/- 0.08 M_\\odot and R_1=1.09_{-0.13}^{+0.15} R_\\odot. We\nare able to exclude transits of the inner companion with high confidence. The\nhost star's spectrum exhibits clear Ca H and K core emission indicating stellar\nactivity, but a lack of photometric variability and small v*sin(I) suggest the\nprimary's spin axis is oriented in a pole-on configuration. The rotational\nperiod of the primary from an activity-rotation relation matches the orbital\nperiod of the inner companion to within 1.5 \\sigma, suggesting they are tidally\nlocked. If the inner companion's orbital angular momentum vector is aligned\nwith the stellar spin axis, as expected through tidal evolution, then it has a\nstellar mass of M_2 ~ 0.3-0.4 M_\\odot. Direct imaging limits the existence of\nstellar companions to projected separations < 30 AU. No set of spectral lines\nand no significant flux contribution to the spectral energy distribution from\neither companion are detected, which places individual upper mass limits of M <\n1.0 M_\\odot, provided they are not stellar remnants. If the tertiary is not a\nstellar remnant, then it likely has a mass of ~0.5-0.6 M_\\odot, and its orbit\nis likely significantly inclined from that of the secondary, suggesting that\nthe Kozai-Lidov mechanism may have driven the dynamical evolution of this\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2012 16:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Possible mechanisms that were brought up to explain this lack of\ncraters were seismic crater erasure and self armoring of a coarse, boulder\ncovered asteroid surface. While seismic shaking has been studied in this\ncontext, the concept of armoring lacks a deeper inspection and an experimental\nground truth. We therefore present cratering experiments of glass bead\nprojectiles impacting into granular glass bead targets, where the grain sizes\nof projectile and target are in a similar range. The impact velocities are in\nthe range of 200 to 300 m/s. We find that craters become fainter and irregular\nshaped as soon as the target grains are larger than the projectile sizes and\nthat granular craters rarely form when the size ratio between projectile and\ntarget grain is around 1:10 or smaller. In that case, we observe a formation of\na strength determined crater in the first struck target grain instead. We\npresent a simple model based on the transfer of momentum from the projectile to\nthis first target grain, which is capable to explain our results with only a\nsingle free parameter, which is moreover well determined by previous\nexperiments.

In general, the proton flux has higher increments at lower energy bands\ncompared with the ambient solar wind. Inside the BL, the core electron flux\nincreases quasi-isotropically and the increments decrease monotonously with\nenergy from ~30% (at 18 eV) to ~10% (at 70 eV); the suprathermal electron flux\nusually increases in either parallel or antiparallel direction; the correlation\ncoefficient of electron flux variations in parallel and antiparallel directions\nchanges sharply from ~0.8 below 70 eV to ~0 above 70 eV. Similar results are\nalso found for RE. However, different phenomena are found across the shock\nwhere the electron flux variations first increase and then decrease with a peak\nincrement (>200%) near 100 eV. The correlation coefficient of electron flux\nvariations in parallel and antiparallel directions is always around 0.8. The\nsimilar behavior of flux variations in BL and RE suggests that reconnection may\ncommonly occur in BL. Our work also implies that the strong energy dependence\nand direction selectivity of electron flux variations, which are previously\nthought to have no enough relevance to magnetic reconnection, could be\nconsidered as an important signature of solar wind reconnection in the\nstatistical point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 03:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

By exploring the shape of the inner region\nof the dark matter halo, we are able to confirm that the halo shape is a oblate\nellipsoid flattened in the direction of the polar disc. We also note that there\nis a twist in the shape profile, where the innermost 3 kpc of the halo flattens\nin the direction perpendicular to the old disc, and then aligns with the polar\ndisc out until the virial radius. This result is then compared to the halo\nshape inferred from the circular velocities of the two discs. We also use the\ntemporal information of the simulation to track the system's evolution, and\nidentify the processes which give rise to this unusual galaxy type. We confirm\nthe proposal that the polar disc galaxy is the result of the last major merger,\nwhere the angular moment of the interaction is orthogonal to the angle of the\ninfalling gas. This merger is followed by the resumption of coherent gas\ninfall. We emphasise that the disc is rapidly restored after the major merger\nand that after this event the galaxy begins to tilt. A significant proportion\nof the infalling gas comes from filaments. This infalling gas from the filament\ngives the gas its angular momentum, and, in the case of the polar disc galaxy,\nthe direction of the gas filament does not change before or after the last\nmajor merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 04:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Socrates et al.

HEM should also create\nfailed-hot Jupiters, with periapses just beyond the influence of fast\ncircularization. Using the technique we previously presented for measuring\neccentricities from photometry (the \"photoeccentric effect\"), we are distilling\na collection of eccentric proto- and failed-hot Jupiters from the Kepler\nObjects of Interest (KOI).

Statistical arguments\nreveal that the transiting candidate has a low false-positive probability of\n3.1%. KOI-1474.01 also exhibits transit timing variations of order an hour. We\nexplore characteristics of the third-body perturber, which is possibly the\n\"smoking-gun\" cause of KOI-1474.01's large eccentricity.

One of the\ndistinguishing features of the fireshell model is that it relates the observed\nspectra to the spectrum in the comoving frame of the fireshell. Originally, a\nfully radiative condition and a comoving thermal spectrum were adopted. An\nadditional power-law in the comoving thermal spectrum is required [...] in the\nfireshell model for GRBs 080319B and 050904.

We synthesised a\npulsar population based on a radio emission model and four gamma-ray gap models\n(Polar Cap, Slot Gap, Outer Gap, and One Pole Caustic) normalizing to the\nnumber of detected radio pulsars in select group of surveys. The luminosity and\nthe wide beams from the outer gaps can easily account for the number of Fermi\ndetections in 2 years of observations.

The beaming factor remains close to 1 over 4\ndecades in Edot evolution for the slot gap whereas it significantly decreases\nwith increasing age for the outer gaps. The evolution of the slot-gap\nluminosity with Edot is compatible with the large dispersion of gamma-ray\nluminosity seen in the LAT data. The stronger evolution predicted for the outer\ngap, which is linked to the polar cap heating by the return current, is\napparently not supported by the LAT data.

Using a Sedov model we further derive an\nelectron density in the X-ray emitting material of 1.56 cm^-3, typical for LMC\nremnants, a large swept-up mass of 830 solar masses, and an explosion energy of\n7.6 x 10^50 erg. These parameters indicate a well evolved SNR with an X-ray\nspectrum dominated by emission from the swept-up material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 13:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Both approaches can handle the case of\ndielectrically discontinuous boundaries where the one-loop theory is known to\nfail. By comparing the theoretical results obtained from these schemes with the\nresults of the MC simulations that we ran for ions at neutral single dielectric\ninterfaces as well as with previous MC data for charged interfaces, we first\nshow that the weak coupling (WC) Debye-Huckel (DH) theory remains\nquantitatively accurate up to the bulk ion density rhob=0.01 M, whereas the SC\ntheory exhibits a good quantitative accuracy up to rhob=0.2 M. Then, we derive\nfrom the perturbative SC scheme the one-loop theory of asymmetrically\npartitioned salt systems around a dielectrically homogeneous charged surface.\nIt is shown that correlation effects originate in these systems from a\ncompetition between the salt screening loss at the interface driving the ions\nto the bulk region, and the interfacial counterion screening excess attracting\nthem towards the surface. In the case of weak surface charges, the interfacial\nsalt screening loss is the dominant effect. As a result, correlations decrease\nthe MF density of both coions and counterions. With increasing surface charge,\nthe surface-attractive counterion screening excess starts to dominate, and\ncorrelation effects amplify in this regime the MF density of both type of ions.\nWe also show that at a characteristic value of the electrostatic coupling\nparameter, electrostatic correlations result in a charge inversion effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 14:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

To\ndate, this translation had to be performed manually by a trained POMDP expert.\nIn this paper, we formalise and automate this translation process using a\nprobabilistic relational model (PRM) encoded in a relational database.

Our study provides\ninformation on the extent, energetics and frequency of outflows in this region,\nwhich are then used to assess the impact of outflows on the parent molecular\ncloud. The search identified 20 outflows in the Taurus region, 8 of which were\npreviously unknown. Both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO data cubes from the Taurus\nmolecular map were used, and dynamical properties of the outflows are derived.\nEven for previously known outflows, our large-scale maps indicate that many of\nthe outflows are much larger than previously suspected, with eight of the flows\n(40%) being more than a parsec long. The mass, momentum and kinetic energy from\nthe 20 outflows are compared to the repository of turbulent energy in Taurus.\nComparing the energy deposition rate from outflows to the dissipation rate of\nturbulence, we conclude that outflows by themselves cannot sustain the observed\nturbulence seen in the entire cloud. However, when the impact of outflows is\nstudied in selected regions of Taurus, it is seen that locally, outflows can\nprovide a significant source of turbulence and feedback. Five of the eight\nnewly discovered outflows have no known associated stellar source, indicating\nthat they may be embedded Class 0 sources. In Taurus, 30% of Class I sources\nand 12% of Flat spectrum sources from the Spitzer YSO catalogue have outflows,\nwhile 75% of known Class 0 objects have outflows. Overall, the paucity of\noutflows in Taurus compared to the embedded population of Class I and Flat\nSpectrum YSOs indicate that molecular outflows are a short-lived stage marking\nthe youngest phase of protostellar life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 15:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Cellular network data has\nbecome a hot source of study for extraction of user-mobility and\nspatio-temporal trends. Location binding in mobility data can be done through\ndifferent methods like GPS, service provider assisted faux-GPS and Cell Global\nIdentity (CGI). Among these Cell Global Identity is most inexpensive method and\nreadily available solution for mobility extraction; however exact spatial\nextraction is somehow a problem in it. This paper presents the spatial\nextraction technique of mobile phone user raw data which carries the\ninformation like location information, proximity location and activity of\nsubjects. This work mainly focuses on the data pre-processing methodology and\ntechnique to interpret the low level mobility data into high level mobility\ninformation using the designed clustering methodology and publically available\nCell-IDs databases.

The largest flare data set of DO Cep in the literature has been\nobtained with 89 flares detected in 67.61 hours of U-band flare patrol. First\nof all, the observations demonstrated that the star is one of the most active\nflare stars in respect to the computed flare frequency. Secondly, using the\nindependent samples t-test, the detected flares were classified into two\nsubtypes, and then they were modelled. Analysing the models demonstrated that\nthe fast and slow flares occurring on the star can be separated with a critical\nvalue of the ratio of their decay time to rise time. The critical value was\ncomputed as 3.40. According to this value, the fast flare rate is 20.22%, while\nthe slow flare rate is 79.78%. Besides, there is a 39.282 times difference\nbetween the energies of these two types of flares. However, the flare\nequivalent durations versus the flare rise times increase in similar ways for\nboth groups. In addition, all all the flares were modelled with the one-phase\nexponential association function. Analysing this model, the plateau value was\nfound to be 2.810. Moreover, the half-life value was computed as 433.1s from\nthe model. The maximum flare rise time was found to be 1164s, while the maximum\nflare total duration was found to be 3472s. The results of the flare timescales\nindicate that the geometry of the flaring loop on the surface of the star might\nbe similar to those seen on analogues of DO Cep. Consequently, considering both\nthe half-life value and flare timescales, the flares detected on the surface of\nDO Cep get maximum energy in longer times, while the geometries of the flaring\nloops or areas get smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jun 2012 19:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}

It appears in isolated\nparticle systems composed of few components. Therefore, the mixing of isolated\nparticle systems S=S1+S2 has been studied. Two cases are considered T1=T2 and\nT1\\leqT2, where T1,T2 are the initial temperatures of the system S1 and S2\nrespectively. The concept of similar systems containing interacting particles\nis introduced. These systems are defined by a common temperature and an\nidentical time evolution process, i.e. the approach to the same thermodynamic\nequilibrium. The main results are: 1) The properties of the similar particle\nsystems yield the non-additive entropy and free energy. The Gibbs Paradox is\nnot a paradox. 2) The relation between the initial temperatures T1 and T2\ngoverns the mixing process. 3) In the two cases T1=T2, T1\\leqT2 mixing of the\nsystems S1, S2 results in a uniform union system S=S1+S2. The systems S, S1, S2\nare similar one to the other. 4) The mixing process is independent of the\nextensive quantities (volume, particle number, energy) and of the particle\ntype. Only the mean energy plays an important role in the mixing of the systems\nS1, S2. 5) Mixing in the case T1\\leqT2 is in essence a thermalization process,\nbut mixing in the case T1=T2 is not a thermodynamic process. 6)Mixing is an\nirreversible process.
