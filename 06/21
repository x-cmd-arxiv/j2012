In fact, we show that\npositive alpha exists under the same scenarios of \"perpetual event swap\" and\n\"market systemic event\" Jarrow (2010) used to formulate the illusionary\npositive alpha result. First, we prove that as long as asset price volatility\nis greater than zero, systemic events like market crash will occur in finite\ntime almost surely. Thus creating an opportunity to hedge against that event.\nSecond, we find that Jarrow's \"false positive alpha\" variable constitutes\nportfolio manager reward for trading strategy. For instance, we show that\npositive alpha exists if portfolio managers develop hedging strategies based on\neither (1) an exotic [barrier] option on the underlying asset - with barrier\nhitting time motivated by the \"market systemic\" event, or (2) a swaption\nstrategy for the implied interest rate risk inherent in Jarrow's triumvirate of\nriskless rate of return, factor sensitivity exposure, and constant risk premium\nfor a perpetual event swap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 17:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

For satisfiability we obtain complexity degrees from P over NP,\nSigma_P^2 and PSPACE up to NEXP, while for model-checking we only classify the\nfragments with respect to their tractability, i.e. we either show\nNP-completeness or containment in P.\n  We then study the extension of modal dependence logic by intuitionistic\nimplication.

We develop a multilevel\nBayesian framework for assessing association of UHECRs and candidate source\npopulations, and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for estimating model\nparameters and comparing models by computing, via Chib's method, marginal\nlikelihoods and Bayes factors. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing\nmeasurements of 69 UHECRs observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) from\n2004-2009, using a volume-complete catalog of 17 local active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) out to 15 megaparsecs as candidate sources. An early portion of the data\n(\"period 1,\" with 14 events) was used by PAO to set an energy cut maximizing\nthe anisotropy in period 1; the 69 measurements include this \"tuned\" subset,\nand subsequent \"untuned\" events with energies above the same cutoff. Also,\nmeasurement errors are approximately summarized. These factors are problematic\nfor independent analyses of PAO data. Within the context of \"standard candle\"\nsource models (i.e., with a common isotropic emission rate), and considering\nonly the 55 untuned events, there is no significant evidence favoring\nassociation of UHECRs with local AGN vs. an isotropic background. The\nhighest-probability associations are with the two nearest, adjacent AGN,\nCentaurus A and NGC 4945. If the association model is adopted, the fraction of\nUHECRs that may be associated is likely nonzero but is well below 50%. Our\nframework enables estimation of the angular scale for deflection of cosmic rays\nby cosmic magnetic fields; relatively modest scales of $\\approx\\!3^{\\circ}$ to\n$30^{\\circ}$ are favored. Models that assign a large fraction of UHECRs to a\nsingle nearby source (e.g., Centaurus A) are ruled out unless very large\ndeflection scales are specified a priori, and even then they are disfavored.\nHowever, including the period 1 data alters the conclusions significantly, and\na simulation study supports the idea that the period 1 data are anomalous,\npresumably due to the tuning.

As a result, the magnetic flux trapped during the collapse in\nthe envelope is being released faster than the flux trapped in the core,\nresulting in much weaker fields in envelopes than in cores, as observed. We\nprovide simple semi-analytical model calculations which support this conclusion\nand qualitatively agree with the observational results.

Unfortunately, identifying transits of such planets in\nphotometric monitoring is complicated both by the intrinsic stellar variability\nthat is common among these stars and by the nocturnal cadence, atmospheric\nvariations, and instrumental systematics that often plague Earth-bound\nobservatories.

The study of the ICL can\nreveal details of the evolutionary histories and processes occurring within\ngalaxy clusters, however since it has a very low surface brightness it is often\ndifficult to detect. We present here the first measurements of the ICL as a\nfraction of total cluster light at z \\sim 1 using deep J-band (1.2 {\\mu}m)\nimaging from HAWK-I on the VLT. We investigate the ICL in 6 X-ray selected\ngalaxy clusters at 0.8< z <1.2 and find that the ICL below isophotes {\\mu}(J) =\n22 mag/arcsec2 constitutes 1-4% of the total cluster light within a radius\nR500. This is broadly consistent with simulations of the ICL at a similar\nredshift and when compared to nearby observations suggests that the fraction of\nthe total cluster light that is in the ICL has increased by a factor 2 - 4\nsince z\\sim1. We also find the fraction of the total cluster light contained\nwithin the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) to be 2.0-6.3% at these redshifts,\nwhich in 5 out of 6 cases is larger than the fraction of the ICL component, in\ncontrast to results from nearby clusters. This suggests that the evolution in\ncluster cores involves substantial stripping activity at late times, in\naddition to the early build up of the BCG stellar mass through merging. The\npresence of significant amounts of stellar light at large radii from these BCGs\nmay help towards solving the recent disagreement between the semi-analytic\nmodel predictions of BCG mass growth (e.g. De Lucia & Blaziot, 2007) and the\nobserved large masses and scale sizes reported for BCGs at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 23:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Detection\nof these IBD segments has recently become feasible, enabling a wide range of\napplications from phasing and imputation to demographic inference. Here, we\nstudy the distribution of IBD sharing in the Wright-Fisher model. Specifically,\nusing coalescent theory, we calculate the variance of the total sharing between\nrandom pairs of individuals. We then investigate the cohort-averaged sharing:\nthe average total sharing between one individual and the rest of the cohort. We\nfind that for large cohorts, the cohort-averaged sharing is distributed\napproximately normally. Surprisingly, the variance of this distribution does\nnot vanish even for large cohorts, implying the existence of \"hyper-sharing\"\nindividuals. The presence of such individuals has consequences for the design\nof sequencing studies, since, if they are selected for whole-genome sequencing,\na larger fraction of the cohort can be subsequently imputed. We calculate the\nexpected gain in power of imputation by IBD, and subsequently, in power to\ndetect an association, when individuals are either randomly selected or\nspecifically chosen to be the hyper-sharing individuals. Using our framework,\nwe also compute the variance of an estimator of the population size that is\nbased on the mean IBD sharing and the variance in the sharing between inbred\nsiblings. Finally, we study IBD sharing in an admixture pulse model, and show\nthat in the Ashkenazi Jewish population the admixture fraction is correlated\nwith the cohort-averaged sharing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 00:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 16:56:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2013 13:26:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2013 16:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

Consequently, the directory not\nonly consumes large chip area, but also incurs considerable energy consumption\nand performance degradation, due to the large number of Invalidation/Ack\nmessages transferred in the interconnection network and resulting network\ncongestion. In this paper, we reveal the interesting fact that the directory is\nactually an unnecessary luxury for practical parallel systems. Because of\nwidely deployed software/hardware techniques involving instruction reordering,\nmost (if not all) parallel systems work under the weak consistency model, where\na remote store instruction is allowed to be invisible to a core before the next\nsynchronization of the core, instead of being made visible eagerly by\ninvalidating PC backups of other cores. Based on this key observation, we\npropose a lightweight novel scheme called {\\em DLS (DirectoryLess Shared\nlast-level cache)}, which completely removes the directory and Invalidation/Ack\nmessages, and efficiently maintains cache coherence using a novel {\\em\nself-suspicion + speculative execution} mechanism.

Each iteration of the al- gorithm formally consists\nof an E-step: evaluate the expected complete-data log-likelihood given the\nobserved data, with expectation taken at current pa- rameter estimate; and an\nM-step: maximize the resulting expression to find the updated estimate.\nConditions that guarantee convergence of the EM se- quence to a unique MLE were\nfound by Boyles (1983) and Wu (1983). In complicated models for\nhigh-dimensional data, it is common to encounter an intractable integral in the\nE-step. The Monte Carlo EM algorithm of Wei and Tanner (1990) works around this\ndifficulty by maximizing instead a Monte Carlo approximation to the appropriate\nconditional expectation. Convergence properties of Monte Carlo EM have been\nstudied, most notably, by Chan and Ledolter (1995) and Fort and Moulines\n(2003). The goal of this review paper is to provide an accessible but rigorous\nin- troduction to the convergence properties of EM and Monte Carlo EM. No\nprevious knowledge of the EM algorithm is assumed. We demonstrate the im-\nplementation of EM and Monte Carlo EM in two simple but realistic examples. We\nshow that if the EM algorithm converges it converges to a stationary point of\nthe likelihood, and that the rate of convergence is linear at best.

In such auctions, future opportunities affect\nstrategic considerations of the players. The goal of this paper is to develop a\nquantitative understanding of outcomes of such sequential auctions. In earlier\nwork (Paes Leme et al. 2012) we initiated the study of the price of anarchy in\nsequential auctions. We considered sequential first price auctions in the full\ninformation model, where players are aware of all future opportunities, as well\nas the valuation of all players. In this paper, we study efficiency in\nsequential auctions in the Bayesian environment, relaxing the informational\nassumption on the players. We focus on two environments, both studied in the\nfull information model in Paes Leme et al. 2012, matching markets and matroid\nauctions. In the full information environment, a sequential first price cut\nauction for matroid settings is efficient. In Bayesian environments this is no\nlonger the case, as we show using a simple example with three players. Our main\nresult is a bound of $1+\\frac{e}{e-1}\\approx 2.58$ on the price of anarchy in\nboth matroid auctions and single-value matching markets (even with correlated\ntypes) and a bound of $2\\frac{e}{e-1}\\approx 3.16$ for general matching markets\nwith independent types. To bound the price of anarchy we need to consider\npossible deviations at an equilibrium. In a sequential Bayesian environment the\neffect of deviations is more complex than in one-shot games; early bids allow\nothers to infer information about the player's value. We create effective\ndeviations despite the presence of this difficulty by introducing a bluffing\ntechnique of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 03:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}

To understand\nthe structure of filaments, cross-section profiles are often fitted with\nPlummer profiles. This profiling is often done with submm studies, such as\nHerschel. It would be convenient if filament properties could also be studied\nusing groundbased NIR data. We compare the filament profiles obtained by NIR\nextinction and submm observations to find out if reliable profiles can be\nderived using NIR data. We use J-, H-, and K-band data of a filament north of\nTMC-1 to derive an extinction map from colour excesses of background stars. We\ncompare the Plummer profiles obtained from extinction maps with Herschel dust\nemission maps. We present 2 methods to estimate profiles from NIR: Plummer\nprofile fits to median Av of stars or directly to the Av of individual stars.\nWe compare the methods by simulations. In simulations extinction maps and the\nnew methods give correct results to within ~10-20 for modest densities. Direct\nfit to data on individual stars gives more accurate results than extinction\nmap, and can work in higher density. In profile fits to real observations,\nvalues of Plummer parameters are generally similar to within a factor of ~2.\nAlthough parameter values can vary significantly, estimates of filament mass\nusually remain accurate to within some tens of per cent. Our results for TMC-1\nare in agreement with earlier results. High resolution NIR data give more\ndetails, but 2MASS data can be used to estimate profiles. NIR extinction can be\nused as an alternative to submm observations to profile filaments. Direct fits\nof stars can also be a valuable tool. Plummer profile parameters are not always\nwell constrained, and caution should be taken when making fits. In the\nevaluation of Plummer parameters, one can use the independence of dust emission\nand NIR data and the difference in the shapes of the confidence regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 11:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The relic lobe is on the near side with regard to\nthe observer, whereas the radiation from the far-side lobe arrives\nsignificantly later owing to its longer distance to the observer. The far-side\nlobe is thus perceived to have not yet decayed. On the other hand, the jet\nbehaves in a standard way, i.e. its projected orientation reflects the near\nside of the source.

In particular, nonlinear quantum\npropagators with non-zero defect quantum electric-charge, are interpreted as\n{\\em exotic-quantum supergravity} effects. As an application, the recently\ndiscovered bound-state called $Zc(3900)$, is obtained as a neutral\nquasi-particle, generated in a $Q$-quantum exotic supergravity process. {\\em\nQuantum entanglement} is justified by means of the algebraic topologic\nstructure of nonlinear quantum propagators. Quantum Cheshire cats are\nconsidered as examples of quantum entanglements. Existence theorem for\nsolutions of $\\hat{(YM)}[i]$ admitting negative local temperatures ({\\em\nquantum thermodynamic-exotic solutions}) is obtained too and related to quantum\nentanglement. Such exotic solutions are used to encode Universe at the\nPlanck-epoch. It is proved that the Universe's expansion at the Planck epoch is\njustified by the fact that it is encoded by a nonlinear quantum propagator\nhaving thermodynamic quantum exotic components in its boundary. This effect\nproduces also an increasing of energy in the Universe at the Einstein epoch:\n{\\em Planck-epoch-legacy} on the boundary of our Universe.

We find bright, complex CO 2-1 line emission in the\ninner 400 pc of the galaxy. The CO 2-1 line has wings that are tracing a\nkinematical component which appears perpendicular to that of the line core.\nTogether with an intriguing X-shape of the integrated intensity and dispersion\nmaps, this suggests that the molecular emission of NGC 1377 consists of a\ndisk-outflow system. Lower limits to the molecular mass and outflow rate are\nM_out(H2)>1e7 Msun and dM/dt>8 Msun/yr. The age of the proposed outflow is\nestimated to 1.4Myrs, the extent to 200pc and the outflow speed to 140 km/s.\nThe total molecular mass in the SMA map is estimated to M_tot(H2)=1.5e8 Msun\n(on a scale of 400 pc) while in the inner r=29 pc the molecular mass is\nM_core(H2)=1.7e7 Msun with a corresponding H2 column density of N(H2)=3.4e23\ncm-2 and an average CO 2-1 brightness temperature of 19K.\n  Observing the molecular properties of the FIR-excess galaxy NGC 1377 allows\nus to probe the early stages of nuclear activity and the onset of feedback in\nactive galaxies. The age of the outflow supports the notion that the current\nnuclear activity is young - a few Myrs. The outflow may be powered by radiation\npressure from a compact, dust enshrouded nucleus, but other driving mechanisms\nare possible. The buried source may be an AGN or an extremely young (1Myr)\ncompact starburst. Limitations on size and mass lead us to favour the AGN\nscenario, but further studies are required to settle the issue. In either case,\nthe wind with its implied mass outflow rate will quench the nuclear power\nsource within a very short time of 5-25 Myrs. It is however possible that the\ngas is unable to escape the galaxy and may eventually fall back onto NGC 1377\nagain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 12:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

So far, all attempts to explain the\nin-situ formation of these planets has been unsuccessful, in part because of\nthe strong gravitational perturbations of the secondary star on any initial\nplanetesimal swarm. Here we test whether planetary bodies in compact binaries,\nin particular gamma-Cephei, could have originated from a close encounter with a\npassing star, assuming initial configurations for the stellar system suitable\nfor planetary formation. In other words, we analyze whether the orbital\nconfiguration of the current binary system might have been generated after the\nformation of the planet, and as a consequence of a close encounter with a third\nstar in hyperbolic orbit. We performed a series of time-reverse N-body\nsimulations of stellar scattering events in which the present-day configuration\nof gamma-Cephei was used as the initial condition plus a hypothetical third\nstar as an impactor. We analyzed which configurations and system parameters\ncould have given birth to the current system.

Thus, although not\nhighly probable, it is plausible that stellar encounters may have played a\nsignificant role in shaping these types of exoplanetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 13:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

Two main formation\nmechanisms each involving two radical-radical reactions are the source of N2 in\nsuch environments.

On the\nother hand, it was known that testing for a path on t vertices as a minor\nadmits a polynomial kernel, but we show that testing for containment of an\ninduced path on t vertices is unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 15:19:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2013 11:53:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 12:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}

The magnetic interactions between the Co2+ moments in this structure\nlead to a complex magnetic phase diagram at low temperature, wherein it\nexhibits a series of five transitions below 11 K that ultimately culminate in a\nsimple ferromagnetic ground state below T~6.2 K. Here we report magnetization\nmeasurements on single and polycrystalline samples of (Co(1-x)Mg(x))3V2O8 for\nx<0.23, as well as elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements on\nsingle crystals of magnetically dilute (Co(1-x)Mg(x))3V2O8 for x=0.029 and\nx=0.194, in which non-magnetic Mg2+ ions substitute for magnetic Co2+. We find\nthat a dilution of 2.9% leads to a suppression of the ferromagnetic transition\ntemperature by ~15% while a dilution level of 19.4% is sufficient to destroy\nferromagnetic long-range order in this material down to a temperature of at\nleast 1.5 K. The magnetic excitation spectrum is characterized by two spin-wave\nbranches in the ordered phase for (Co(1-x)Mg(x))3V2O8 (x=0.029), similar to\nthat of the pure x=0 material, and by broad diffuse scattering at temperatures\nbelow 10 K in (Co(1-x)Mg(x))3V2O8 (x=0.194). Such a strong dependence of the\ntransition temperatures to long range order in the presence of quenched\nnon-magnetic impurities is consistent with two-dimensional physics driving the\ntransitions. We further provide a simple percolation model that\nsemi-quantitatively explains the inability of this system to establish\nlong-range magnetic order at the unusually-low dilution levels which we observe\nin our experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 15:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We performed\ntemporal and spectral analysis for all events and found that their temporal\ncharacteristics are very similar to the ones of other SGR bursts, as well the\nones reported for the bursts of the main episode (average burst durations \\sim\n170 ms). In addition, we used our sample of bursts to quantify the systematic\nuncertainties of the GBM location algorithm for soft gamma-ray transients to <\n8 deg. Our spectral analysis indicates significant spectral evolution between\nthe first and last set of events. Although the 2008 October events are best fit\nwith a single blackbody function, for the 2009 bursts an Optically Thin Thermal\nBremsstrahlung (OTTB) is clearly preferred. We attribute this evolution to\nchanges in the magnetic field topology of the source, possibly due to effects\nfollowing the very energetic main bursting episode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 15:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-08"}

In the cosmological context, the de\nSitter universe obeys the same holographic equipartition. I argue that the\ndifference between the surface degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of\nfreedom in a region of space (which has already emerged) drives the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe through a simple equation dV/dt = (N_{sur} -\nN_{bulk}) where V is the Hubble volume in Planck units and t is the cosmic time\nin Planck units.

Here, it is rigorously proven that the cat is not in a\nsuperposition. This is central to the measurement problem. Nonlocal two-photon\ninterferometry experiments throw further light on the measurement state by\nprobing the effect of a variable phase factor inserted between its superposed\nterms. These experiments demonstrate that both subsystems really are in locally\nmixed states rather than superpositions, and they tell us what the measurement\nstate superposition actually superposes. They show that measurement transfers\nthe coherence in Schroedinger's nuclear superposition neither to the cat nor to\nthe nucleus, but only to the correlations between them.
