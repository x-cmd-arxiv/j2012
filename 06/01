However, for\ngeneral domains of practical interest (such as Lipschitz polyhedra), the\nexistence of such solutions is not evident.\n  This paper considers a finite-element approximation of Maxwell's equations in\nthe exterior of a polyhedron, whose boundary approximates the sphere. Standard\nNedelec-Raviart-Thomas elements are used with a Crank-Nicholson scheme to\napproximate the electric and magnetic fields. Discrete initial conditions\ninterpolating the ones chosen in [7] are modified so that they are (weakly)\ndivergence-free. We prove that with such initial conditions, the approximation\nto the electric field is weakly divergence-free for all time. Finally, we show\nnumerically that the finite-element approximations of the ADS also decay\nexponentially with time when the mesh size and the time step become small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 17:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2012 20:18:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2012 12:40:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2013 14:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 17:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

Both inhomogeneous distribution of coupling strength to\nthe field and interactions between individual atoms reduce the visibility of\nthe oscillation and may even suppress it completely.

It is the objective of this work to\nshow a path of obtaining gauge invariant theories from non-invariant ones. Both\nare named also as first- and second-class theories respectively, obeying\nDirac's formalism. Namely, it is very important to understand why it is always\ndesirable to have a bridge between gauge invariant and non-invariant theories.\nOnce established, this kind of mapping between first-class (gauge invariant)\nand second-class systems, in Dirac's formalism can be considered as a sort of\nequivalence. This work describe this kind of equivalence obtaining a gauge\ninvariant theory starting with a non-invariant one using the symplectic\nembedding formalism developed by some of us some years back. To illustrate the\nprocedure it was analyzed both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. It was\ndemonstrated that this method is more convenient than others.

We illustrate the features of\nthis SASI-dominated regime using an explosion model of a 27 solar mass\nprogenitor, which is contrasted with a convectively-dominated model of an 8.1\nsolar mass progenitor with subsolar metallicity, whose early post-bounce\nbehavior is more in line with previous 11.2 and 15 solar mass explosion models.\nWe analyze the conditions discriminating between the two different regimes,\nshowing that a high mass-accretion rate and a short advection time-scale are\nconducive for strong SASI activity. We also briefly discuss some important\nfactors for capturing the SASI-driven regime, such as general relativity, the\nprogenitor structure, a nuclear equation of state leading to a compact\nproto-neutron star, and the neutrino treatment. Finally, we evaluate possible\nimplications of our findings for 2D and 3D supernova simulations. Our results\nshow that a better understanding of the SASI and convection in the non-linear\nregime is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 19:20:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 10:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\nmodel includes ongoing spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). We show that\ncertain classes of STDP rules can lead to the stabilization of memory patterns\nstored in the network. The stabilization results from rehearsals induced by\nnoise. We show that unstructured neural noise, after passing through the\nrecurrent network weights, carries the imprint of all memory patterns in\ntemporal correlations. Under certain conditions, STDP combined with these\ncorrelations, can lead to reinforcement of all existing patterns, even those\nthat are never explicitly visited. Thus, unstructured neural noise can\nstabilize the existing structure of synaptic connectivity.

We find that unlensed population\nIII stars are beyond the reach of JWST, and that even lensed population III\nstars will be extremely difficult to detect. However, the main problem with the\nlatter approach is not necessarily that the lensed stars are too faint, but\nthat their surface number densities are too low. To detect even one population\nIII star of 60 solar masses when pointing JWST through the galaxy cluster MACS\nJ0717.5+3745, the lensing cluster with the largest Einstein radius detected so\nfar, the cosmic star formation rate of population III stars would need to be\napproximately an order of magnitude higher than predicted by the most\noptimistic current models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 16:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-02"}

Observations have revealed that half of their progenitors, six\nbillion years ago, had peculiar morphologies and/or kinematics, which exclude\nthem from the Hubble sequence. Major mergers, i.e., fusions between galaxies of\nsimilar mass, are found to be the likeliest driver for such strong\npeculiarities. However, thin disks are fragile and easily destroyed by such\nviolent collisions, which creates a critical tension between the observed\nfraction of thin disks and their survival within the L-CDM paradigm. Here we\nshow that the observed high occurrence of mergers amongst their progenitors is\nonly apparent and is resolved when using morpho-kinematic observations which\nare sensitive to all the phases of the merging process. This provides an\noriginal way of narrowing down observational estimates of the galaxy merger\nrate and leads to a perfect match with predictions by state-of-the-art L-CDM\nsemi-empirical models with no particular fine-tuning needed. These results\nimply that half of local thin disks do not survive but are actually rebuilt\nafter a gas-rich major merger occurring in the past nine billion years, i.e.,\ntwo-thirds of the lifetime of the Universe. This emphasizes the need to study\nhow thin disks can form in halos with a more active merger history than\npreviously considered, and to investigate what is the origin of the gas\nreservoir from which local disks would reform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 May 2012 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 12:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

These high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation and\ndestruction of individual GMCs and star clusters. The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this\nrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR\nphotons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the\nmost extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives\nsuper-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind\nmaterial falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher\npost-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback.

Design/methodology/approach: The\nkey metric in this system is a \"VPU\", which simultaneously optimizes multiple\naspects of clinical care. The resulting mathematical value of clinical\nproductivity was hypothesized to tightly link the organization's performance to\nits expectations and, through transparency and decision support tools at the\nclinician level, affect significant changes in productivity, quality, and\nconsistency relative to traditional models of clinical productivity. Findings:\nIn only 3 months, every single variable integrated into the VPU system showed\nsignificant improvement, including a 30% rise in revenue, 10% rise in clinical\npercentage, a 25% rise in treatment plan completion, a 20% rise in case rate\neligibility, along with similar improvements in compliance/audit issues,\noutcomes collection, access, etc. Practical implications: A data-driven\nclinical productivity system employing decision support functionality is\neffective because of the impact on clinician behavior relative to traditional\nclinical productivity systems. Critically, the model is also extensible to\nintegration with outcomes-based productivity. Originality/Value: EHR's are only\na first step - the problem is turning that data into useful information.\nTechnology can leverage the data in order to produce actionable information\nthat can inform clinical practice and decision-making.

Our catalog allows the selection of volume-limited subsamples\ncontaining all low-power radio galaxies, similar to the prototypical low-power\nradio galaxies Cen A or M87, within some hundred Mpc. It is constructed by\nmatching radio emission from the NVSS and SUMSS surveys to galaxies of the\n2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) using an image-level algorithm that properly\ntreats the extended structure of radio sources. The sample contains 575\nradio-emitting galaxies with a flux greater than 213 mJy at 1.4 GHz. Over 30%\nof the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in existing large-area\nextra-galactic radio samples.

We find that the galaxy density around radio galaxies is\nsignificantly higher than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity and\nmorphology.

Since\nmodular boundaries are efficient filters of information, in the \"learning\ncompetent\" state information filtering may be much smaller, than after memory\nformation. This mechanism restricts high information transfer to the \"learning\ncompetent\" state. After memory formation, modular boundary-induced segregation\nand information filtering protect the stored information.

In this paper, we\ndevelop a model-based approach for designing oscillations that suppress\nturbulence in a channel flow. We utilize eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearization\nof the turbulent flow with control in conjunction with turbulence modeling to\ndetermine skin-friction drag in a simulation-free manner. The Boussinesq eddy\nviscosity hypothesis is used to quantify the effect of fluctuations on the mean\nvelocity in the flow subject to control. In contrast to the traditional\napproach that relies on numerical simulations, we determine the turbulent\nviscosity from the second order statistics of the linearized model driven by\nwhite-in-time stochastic forcing. The spatial power spectrum of the forcing is\nselected to ensure that the linearized model for the uncontrolled flow\nreproduces the turbulent energy spectrum. The resulting correction to the\nturbulent mean velocity induced by small amplitude wall movements is then used\nto identify the optimal frequency of drag reducing oscillations. In addition,\nthe control net efficiency and the turbulent flow structures that we obtain\nagree well with the results of numerical simulations and experiments. This\ndemonstrates the predictive power of our model-based approach to controlling\nturbulent flows and is expected to pave the way for successful flow control at\nhigher Reynolds numbers than currently possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 07:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

The model\nconsists of an anonymous broadcast network in which nodes have no knowledge\nabout the topology of the network or even an upper bound on its size.\nFurthermore, it is assumed that an adversary chooses at which time slot each\nnode wakes up. At each time slot a node can either beep, that is, emit a\nsignal, or be silent. At a particular time slot, beeping nodes receive no\nfeedback, while silent nodes can only differentiate between none of its\nneighbors beeping, or at least one of its neighbors beeping.\n  We start by proving a lower bound that shows that in this model, it is not\npossible to locally converge to an MIS in sub-polynomial time.

Mechanisms from the field of statistical physics have long been\nsuggesting that this homeostasis of brain activity could occur even without a\ncentral regulator, via self-organization on the level of neurons and their\ninteractions, alone. Such physical mechanisms from the class of self-organized\ncriticality exhibit characteristic dynamical signatures, similar to seismic\nactivity related to earthquakes. Measurements of cortex rest activity showed\nfirst signs of dynamical signatures potentially pointing to self-organized\ncritical dynamics in the brain. Indeed, recent more accurate measurements\nallowed for a detailed comparison with scaling theory of non-equilibrium\ncritical phenomena, proving the existence of criticality in cortex dynamics. We\nhere compare this new evaluation of cortex activity data to the predictions of\nthe earliest physics spin model of self-organized critical neural networks.

The spin\nmodel is a candidate for a minimal model of a self-organized critical adaptive\nnetwork for the universality class of neural criticality.

Using this QPO we\nmeasured, for the first time, the rate at which the QPO frequency changes as a\nfunction of QPO frequency. For this we used the spread of the QPO frequency\nover groups of 10 consecutive measurements, sampling timescales between 320 and\n1600 s, and the time derivative of the QPO frequency over timescales of 32 to\n160 s. We found that: (i) Both the QPO-frequency spread and the QPO time\nderivative decrease by a factor ~ 3 as the QPO frequency increases. (ii) The\naverage value of the QPO time derivative decreases by a factor of ~ 2 as the\ntimescale over which the derivative is measured increases from less than 64 s\nto 160 s. (iii) The relation between the absolute value of the QPO time\nderivative and the QPO frequency is consistent with being the same both for the\npositive and negative QPO-frequency derivative. We show that, if either the\nlower or the upper kHz QPO reflects the Keplerian frequency at the inner edge\nof the accretion disc, these results support a scenario in which the inner part\nof the accretion disc is truncated at a radius that is set by the combined\neffect of viscosity and radiation drag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 13:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In the eighties, three physicists, Knizhnik, Polyakov et\nZamolodchikov (KPZ) came up in \\cite{\\KPZ} with a novel and far-reaching\napproach in order to understand the critical behavior of these models. Among\nthese, one finds for example random walks, percolation as well as the Ising\nmodel. The main underlying idea of their approach is to study these models\nalong a two-step procedure as follows: a/ First of all, instead of considering\nthe model on some regular lattice of the plane (such as $\\Z^2$ for example),\none defines it instead on a well-chosen \"random planar lattice\". Doing so\ncorresponds to studying the model in its {\\it quantum gravity} form. In the\ncase of percolation, the appropriate choice of random lattice matches with the\nso-called planar maps. b/ Then it remains to get back to the actual {\\it\nEuclidean} setup. This is done thanks to the celebrated {\\bf KPZ formula} which\ngives a very precise correspondence between the geometric properties of models\nin their quantum gravity formulation and their analogs in the Euclidean case.\n  The nature and the origin of such a powerful correspondence remained rather\nmysterious for a long time. In fact, the KPZ formula is still not rigorously\nestablished and remains a conjectural correspondence. The purpose of this\nsurvey is to explain how the recent work of Duplantier and Sheffield enables to\nexplain some of the mystery hidden behind this KPZ formula. To summarize their\ncontribution in one sentence, their work implies a beautiful interpretation of\nthe KPZ correpondence through a uniformization of the random lattice, seen as a\nRiemann surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 14:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-04"}

We also show that the inclusion of FeI has substantial\nline-blanketing effects on the optical spectra. Our model spectra and synthetic\nlight curves are compared to the observations of SN 1987A. The spectral\nevolution shows broad agreement with the observations, especially H\\alpha. The\nuncertainties of the non-thermal solver are studied, and are expected to be\nsmall. With this new addition of non-thermal effects in CMFGEN, we now treat\nall known important processes controlling the radiative transfer of a supernova\nejecta, whatever the type and the epoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 15:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

First, we present a\ngrid-based clustering algorithm that has several advantages and comparable\nperformance to the well known efficient clustering algorithm. The algorithm has\nseveral advantages. The algorithm does not require many input parameters. It\nrequires only three parameters, the number of the points in the data space, the\nnumber of the cells in the grid and a percentage. The number of the cells in\nthe grid reflects the accuracy that should be achieved by the algorithm. The\nalgorithm is capable of discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes. The\ncomputational complexity of the algorithm is comparable to the complexity of\nthe most efficient clustering algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented and\ntested against different ranges of database sizes. The performance results show\nthat the running time of the algorithm is superior to the most well known\nalgorithms (CLARANS [23]). The results show also that the performance of the\nalgorithm do not degrade as the number of the data points increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 15:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-04"}
