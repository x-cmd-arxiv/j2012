Changes in its\nradio morphology suggested in the past the hypothesis of a precessing\nmicroquasar. In 2006, a set of VLBA observations performed all around the orbit\nwere not used to study the precession because the souce was explained in the\ncontext of the pulsar model, the alternative model for this system. However, a\nsuccessive radio spectral index analysis has confirmed the predictions of the\nmicroquasar scenario in LSI+61303. At the light of these results we reanalysed\nthe set of VLBA observations that constitutes a unique tool to determine the\nprecession period and render a better understanding of the physical mechanism\nbehind the precession. We improved the dynamic range of the images by a factor\nof four using self-calibration, and the self-calibrated maps reveal, in six out\nof ten images, a double-sided structure. The double-sided structure has\nvariable position angle and switches at some epochs to a one-sided structure.\nThese variations indicate a scenario where the precessing jet, inducing\nvariable Doppler boosting, points close to our line of sight - a microblazar,\nthe galactic version of the extra-galactic blazars. High energy observations of\nLSI+61303 are consistent with the microblazar nature of this object. Moreover,\nwe suggest in LSI+61303 the first case of core shift effect observed in a\nmicroquasar. Because of this effect, well known in AGN, the cm-core of the jet\nis rather displaced from the system center. In LSI+61303, the cm-core of the\njet traces a large ellipse, 7 times larger than the orbit, in a period of about\n28 d. Our hypothesis is that this ellipse is the cross-section of the\nprecession cone of the jet at the distance of the 3.6 cm-core, and its period\nis the precession period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jun 2012 17:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-19"}

Here deuteron\nstripping processes off a target nucleus consisting of ${A}$ nucleons are\ntreated within the framework of the few-body integral equations theory. The\ngeneralized Faddeev equations in the AGS form, which take into account the\ntarget excitations, with realistic optical potentials provide the most advanced\nand complete description of the deuteron stripping. The main problem in\npractical application of such equations is the screening of the Coulomb\npotential, which works only for light nuclei. In this paper we present a new\nformulation of the Faddeev equations in the AGS form taking into account the\ntarget excitations with explicit inclusion of the Coulomb interaction. By\nprojecting the $(A+2)$-body operators onto target states, matrix three-body\nintegral equations are derived which allow for the incorporation of the excited\nstates of the target nucleons. Using the explicit equations for the partial\nCoulomb scattering wave functions in the momentum space we present the AGS\nequations in the Coulomb distorted wave representation without screening\nprocedure. We also use the explicit expression for the off-shell two-body\nCoulomb scattering $T$-matrix which is needed to calculate the effective\npotentials in the AGS equations. The integrals containing the off-shell Coulomb\nT-matrix are regularized to make the obtained equations suitable for\ncalculations.

Not only does stellar mass trace\nout the underlying distribution of matter, it also minimises the effects of\nstar formation and dust on the appearance and structure of a galaxy. We present\nin this paper a study of the stellar mass distributions and structures of\ngalaxies at z<1 as found within the GOODS fields. We use pixel by pixel\nK-corrections to construct stellar mass and mass-to-light ratio maps of 560\ngalaxies of known morphology at magnitudes z_{850}<24. We measure structural\nand size parameters using these stellar mass maps, as well as on ACS BViz band\nimaging. This includes investigating the structural CAS-Gini-M_{20} parameters\nand half-light radius for each galaxy. We compare structural parameters and\nhalf-light radii in the ACS z_{850}-band and stellar mass maps, finding no\nsystematic bias introduced by measuring galaxy sizes in z_{850}. We furthermore\ninvestigate relations between structural parameters in the ACS BViz bands and\nstellar mass maps, and compare our result to previous morphological studies.\nCombinations of various parameters in stellar mass generally reveal clear\nseparations between early and late type morphologies, but cannot easily\ndistinguish between star formation and dynamically disturbed systems. We also\nshow that while ellipticals and early-type spirals have fairly constant CAS\nvalues at z<1 we find a tendency for late-type spiral and peculiar\nmorphological types to have a higher A(M_{*}) at higher redshift.

In particular, the\nantiferromagnetic interaction is assumed to have a range much larger than the\nferromagnetic one. The competition between these two effects is expected to\nlead to the spontaneous emergence of a regular alternation of long intervals on\nwhich the spin profile is magnetized either up or down, with an oscillation\nscale intermediate between the range of the ferromagnetic and that of the\nantiferromagnetic interaction. In this sense, the optimal or quasi-optimal\nprofiles are \"froth-like\": if seen on the scale of the antiferromagnetic\npotential they look neutral, but if seen at the microscope they actually\nconsist of big bubbles of two different phases alternating among each other. In\nthis paper we prove the validity of this picture, we compute the oscillation\nscale of the quasi-optimal profiles and we quantify their distance in norm from\na reference periodic profile. The proof consists of two main steps: we first\ncoarse grain the system on a scale intermediate between the range of the\nferromagnetic potential and the expected optimal oscillation scale; in this way\nwe reduce the original functional to an effective \"sharp interface\" one.

Motivated by the recent work of Barbieri et al, we compare\nthe CMFV correlations with the ones present in a special class of models with\nan approximate global U(2)^3 flavour symmetry, constrained by a minimal set of\nspurions governing the breakdown of this symmetry and the assumption that only\nSM operators are relevant in flavour physics. This analog of CMFV to be called\nMU(2)^3 allows to avoid the Delta M_{s,d}-epsilon_K tension in question because\nof reduced flavour symmetry and implied non-MFV contributions to Delta M_{s,d}.\nWhile the patterns of flavour violation in K meson system is the same as in\nCMFV models, the CP-violation in B_{s,d} meson systems can deviate from the one\nin the SM and CMFV models. We point out a stringent triple S_{psi K_S}-S_{psi\nphi}-|V_ub| correlation in this class of models that could in the future\nprovide a transparent distinction between different MU(2)^3 models and in the\ncontext of these models determine |V_ub| by means of precise measurements of\nS_{psi K_S} and S_{psi phi} with only small hadronic uncertainties. For fixed\nS_{psi K_S} the correlation between B(B^+ -> tau^+nu_tau) and S_{psi phi}\nfollows.

This is motivated by the fact that the observed luminous\nparts of the dSphs are actually non-spherical and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models\npredict non-spherical virialized dark halos. Our models consider velocity\nanisotropy of stars $\\bar{v^2_R} / \\bar{v^2_{\\phi}}$, which can vary with the\nadopted cylindrical coordinates under the assumption $\\bar{v^2_z}=\\bar{v^2_R}$\nfor simplicity, and also include an inclination of the system as a fitting\nparameter to explain the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile.\nApplying these models to six of the bright dSphs in the Milky Way, we find that\nthe best-fitting cases for most of the dSphs yield oblate and flattened dark\nhalos, irrespective of assumed density profiles in their central parts. We also\nfind that the total mass of the dSphs enclosed within a spheroid with\nmajor-axis length of 300 pc varies from $10^6M_{\\odot}$ to $10^7M_{\\odot}$,\ncontrary to the conclusion from spherical models. This suggests the importance\nof considering shapes of dark halos in mass models of the dSphs.

We\nfind that cosmic ray acceleration in the lobes of Centaurus A is not favored,\nwhile acceleration in the stellar winds that are rich in intermediate-mass\nnuclei, could meet the requirement. This suggests that the observed excess may\noriginate from cosmic ray accelerators induced by stellar explosions in the\nstar-forming regions of Centaurus A and/or the Centaurus cluster located behind\nCentaurus A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 12:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper, we give a more\nthorough presentation of our approach, and introduce many new results. We\npresent the probabilistic approach to reconstruction and discuss its optimality\nand robustness. We detail the derivation of the message passing algorithm for\nreconstruction and expectation max- imization learning of signal-model\nparameters. We further develop the asymptotic analysis of the corresponding\nphase diagrams with and without measurement noise, for different distribution\nof signals, and discuss the best possible reconstruction performances\nregardless of the algorithm. We also present new efficient seeding matrices,\ntest them on synthetic data and analyze their performance asymptotically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 14:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-20"}

In this paper we aim at searching the exponentially\nlarge space of all possible groups of tasks that may share a feature space. The\nmain contribution is a convex formulation that employs a graph-based\nregularizer and simultaneously discovers few groups of related tasks, having\nclose-by task parameters, as well as the feature space shared within each\ngroup.

Its solution via\nvariational principles leads to an Euler-Lagrange PDE. However, the PDE is\nalways high-dimensional and cannot be directly solved by common methods.\nInstead, radial basis functions are utilized to approximate the target\nfunction, reducing the problem to finding the linear coefficients of basis\nfunctions. We apply the proposed methods to supervised learning tasks\n(including binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression)\non benchmark data sets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated promising\nresults of the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}

We represent\nan input datapoint as a mixture of probabilities over the corresponding set of\nfeature vectors where each probability indicates how likely each vector is to\nbelong to an unknown prototype pattern. We propose a probabilistic model that\nparameterizes these prototype patterns in terms of hidden variables and\ntherefore it can be trained with conventional approaches based on likelihood\nmaximization. More importantly, both the model parameters and the prototype\npatterns can be learned from data in a discriminative way. We show that our\nmodel can be seen as a probabilistic generalization of learning vector\nquantization (LVQ). We apply our method to the problems of shape\nclassification, hyperspectral imaging classification and people's work class\ncategorization, showing the superior performance of our method compared to the\nstandard prototype-based classification approach and other competitive\nbenchmark methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}
