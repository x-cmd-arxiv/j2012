Likewise, there is an increased\nemphasis on performing analytics based on multiple datasets obtained from\ndifferent data sources. While ensuring security of data and computation\noutsourced to a third party cloud is in itself challenging, supporting\nanalytics using data distributed across multiple, independent clouds is even\nfurther from trivial. In this paper we present CloudMine, a cloud-based service\nwhich allows multiple data owners to perform privacy-preserved computation over\nthe joint data using their clouds as delegates. CloudMine protects data privacy\nwith respect to semi-honest data owners and semi-honest clouds. It furthermore\nensures the privacy of the computation outputs from the curious clouds. It\nallows data owners to reliably detect if their cloud delegates have been lazy\nwhen carrying out the delegated computation. CloudMine can run as a centralized\nservice on a single cloud, or as a distributed service over multiple,\nindependent clouds. CloudMine supports a set of basic computations that can be\nused to construct a variety of highly complex, distributed privacy-preserving\ndata analytics. We demonstrate how a simple instance of CloudMine (secure sum\nservice) is used to implement three classical data mining tasks\n(classification, association rule mining and clustering) in a cloud\nenvironment. We experiment with a prototype of the service, the results of\nwhich suggest its practicality for supporting privacy-preserving data analytics\nas a (multi) cloud-based service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2012 16:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 05:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-02"}

If $\\g$\nis a Lie algebra with an involutive automorphism $\\tau$. Decompose $\\g = \\fh\n\\oplus \\fq = \\ker(\\tau - \\1) \\oplus \\ker(\\tau + \\1)$ into $\\tau$-eigenspaces\nand let $\\g^c := \\fh \\oplus i \\fq$. At the core of the notion of reflection\npositivity is the idea that this duality can sometimes be implemented on the\nlevel of unitary representations. The idea is simple on the Lie algebra level:\nLet $(\\pi,\\cH^0)$ be a representation of $\\g$ where $\\pi$ acts by\nskew-symmetric operators. Assume that there exists a unitary operator $J$ of\norder two such that $J \\pi J = \\pi\\circ \\tau$ and a $\\g$-invariant subspace\n$\\cK^0$ which is {\\it $J$-positive}. Then complex linear extension leads to a\nrepresentation of $\\g^c$ on $\\cK^0$ by operators which are skew-symmetric with\nrespect to $h_J$, so that we obtain a \"unitary\" representation of $\\g^c$ on the\npre-Hilbert space $\\cK_J^0 := \\cK_J/{v \\: \\cK^0 \\: h_J(v,v)=0}$.\n  The aim of this article is twofold. First we discuss reflection positivity in\nan abstract setting using {\\it reflection positive distributions} on the Lie\ngroup $G_\\tau =G\\rtimes {1,\\tau}$ and {\\it reflection positive distribution\nvectors} of a unitary representation of $G_\\tau$. Then we apply these ideas to\nthe conformal group $\\OO_{1,n+1}^+(\\R)$ of the sphere $\\bS^n$ as well as the\nthe half-space picture mostly used in physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jun 2012 16:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 19:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-18"}

PDQ enables flow\npreemption to approximate a range of scheduling disciplines. For example, PDQ\ncan emulate a shortest job first algorithm to give priority to the short flows\nby pausing the contending flows. PDQ borrows ideas from centralized scheduling\ndisciplines and implements them in a fully distributed manner, making it\nscalable to today's data centers.

So far,\nthe research has been focused on interdependent random networks without space\nlimitations. However, many real systems, such as power grids and the Internet,\nare not random but are spatially embedded. Here we analytically and numerically\nanalyze the stability of systems consisting of interdependent spatially\nembedded networks modeled as lattice networks. Surprisingly, we find that in\nlattice systems, in contrast to non-embedded systems, there is no CD and\n\\textit{any} small fraction of interdependent nodes leads to an abrupt\ncollapse.

In the thermodynamic\nlimit, the Lee-Yang zeros approach to real numbers at the critical temperature.\nHowever, the imaginary Lee-Yang zeros have not been regarded as experimentally\nobservable since they occur at imaginary field or temperature, which are\nunphysical. Here we show that the coherence of a probe spin weakly coupled to a\nmany-body system presents zeros as a function of time that are one-to-one\nmapped to the Lee-Yang zeros of the many-body system. In the thermodynamic\nlimit, of which the Lee-Yang zeros form a continuum, the probe spin coherence\npresents a sudden death at the edge singularities of the Lee-Yang zeros. By\nmeasuring the probe spin coherence, one can directly reconstruct the partition\nfunction of a many-body system. These discoveries establish a profound relation\nbetween two most fundamental quantities in the physical world, time and\ntemperature, and also provide a universal approach to studying interacting\nmany-body systems through measuring coherence of only one probe spin (or one\nqubit in quantum computing).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 01:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-24"}

Along with\nthe methyl / acetate or other groups bound to the modified residues the torsion\nangles of the nearby histone chain are supposed to participate in the quantum\ntransition cooperatively. The transition rate W is calculated based on the\nnon-radiative quantum transition theory in adiabatic approximation. By using\nW's the reaction equations can be written for histone modification and the\nhistone modification level can be calculable from the equations, which is\ndecided by not only the atomic group bound to the modified residue, but also\nthe nearby histone chain. The theory can explain the mechanism for the\ncorrelation between a pair of chromatin markers observed in histone\nmodification. The temperature dependence and the coherence-length dependence of\nhistone modification are deduced. Several points for checking the proposed\ntheory and the quantum nature of histone modification are suggested as follows:\n1, The relationship between lnW and 1/T is same as usual protein folding. The\nnon-Arhenius temperature dependence of the histone modification level is\npredicted. 2, The variation of histone modification level through point\nmutation of some residues on the chain is predicted since the mutation may\nchange the coherence-length of the system. 3, Multi-site modification obeys the\nquantum superposition law and the comparison between multi-site transition and\nsingle modification transition gives an additional clue to the testing of the\nquantum nature of histone modification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 02:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However, recent efforts to predict the\namplitude of the solar cycle have resulted in diverging forecasts with no\nconsensus. Yeates et al. (2008) have shown that the dynamical memory of the\nsolar dynamo mechanism governs predictability and this memory is different for\nadvection- and diffusion-dominated solar convection zones. By utilizing\nstochastically forced, kinematic dynamo simulations, we demonstrate that the\ninclusion of downward turbulent pumping of magnetic flux reduces the memory of\nboth advection- and diffusion-dominated solar dynamos to only one cycle;\nstronger pumping degrades this memory further. Thus, our results reconcile the\ndiverging dynamo-model-based forecasts for the amplitude of solar cycle 24. We\nconclude that reliable predictions for the maximum of solar activity can be\nmade only at the preceding minimum--allowing about 5 years of advance planning\nfor space weather.

Moreover, soft interactions unavoidably give an underlying\ncomponent to the rare `hard' events, from which we hope to extract new physics.\nHere, we discuss how to quantify this contamination. First we present a brief\nintroduction to diffraction. We emphasize the different treatment required for\nproton dissociation into low- and high-mass systems; the former requiring a\nmultichannel eikonal approach, and the latter the computation of triple-Pomeron\ndiagrams with multi-Pomeron corrections. Then we give an overview of the\nPomeron, and explain how the QCD (BFKL-type) Pomeron is the natural object to\ncontinue from the `hard' to the `soft' domain. In this way we can obtain a\npartonic description of soft interactions. We introduce the so-called KMR\nmodel, based on this partonic approach, which includes absorptive multi-Pomeron\ncorrections that become increasingly important as we proceed further into the\nsoft domain. This model is able to describe total, elastic and proton\ndissociation data, and to predict the survival probability of large rapidity\ngaps to soft rescattering --- in terms of a few physically-motivated\nparameters. However, more differential phenomena, such as single particle p_t\ndistributions, can only be satisfactorily described if hadronization effects\nare included. This is achieved by incorporating the KMR analytic approach into\nthe SHERPA Monte Carlo framework. It allows a description of soft physics and\ndiffraction, together with jet physics, in a coherent, self-consistent way. We\noutline the structure, and show a few results, of this Monte Carlo, which we\ncall SHRiMPS, for reasons which will become clear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 08:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

Often, the common\nthinking among researchers and implementers is that compression is always a\ngood choice, because the major source of energy consumption in a sensor node\ncomes from the transmission of the data. Lossy compression is deemed a viable\nsolution as the imperfect reconstruction of the signal is often acceptable in\nWSN. In this paper, we thoroughly review a number of lossy compression methods\nfrom the literature, and analyze their performance in terms of compression\nefficiency, computational complexity and energy consumption. We consider two\ndifferent scenarios, namely, wireless and underwater communications, and show\nthat signal compression may or may not help in the reduction of the overall\nenergy consumption, depending on factors such as the compression algorithm, the\nsignal statistics and the hardware characteristics, i.e., micro-controller and\ntransmission technology. The lesson that we have learned, is that signal\ncompression may in fact provide some energy savings. However, its usage should\nbe carefully evaluated, as in quite a few cases processing and transmission\ncosts are of the same order of magnitude, whereas, in some other cases, the\nformer may even dominate the latter. In this paper, we show quantitative\ncomparisons to assess these tradeoffs in the above mentioned scenarios.\nFinally, we provide formulas, obtained through numerical fittings, to gauge\ncomputational complexity, overall energy consumption and signal representation\naccuracy for the best performing algorithms as a function of the most relevant\nsystem parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 08:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

This paper proposes RepTFD, the\nfirst core-level transient fault detection scheme with 100% coverage. Instead\nof providing redundancy for each core separately, RepTFD provides redundancy\nfor a group of cores as a whole. To be specific, it replays the execution of\nthe checked group of cores on a redundant group of cores. Through comparing the\nexecution results between the two groups of cores, all malignant transient\nfaults can be caught. Moreover, RepTFD adopts a novel pending period based\nrecord-replay approach, which can greatly reduce the number of execution orders\nthat need to be enforced in the replay-run. Hence, RepTFD brings only 4.76%\nperformance overhead in comparison to the normal execution without\nfault-tolerance according to our experiments on the RTL design of an industrial\nCMP named Godson-3. In addition, RepTFD only consumes about 0.83% area of\nGodson-3, while needing only trivial modifications to existing components of\nGodson-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 08:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

However, high angular\nresolution data are critical not only for interpreting the spatial distribution\nof the deuteration ratio but also for understanding this complex region in\nterms of cloud evolution involving star-forming activities and stellar\nfeedbacks. We present here the first high angular resolution (1.8 arcsec \\times\n0.8 arcsec) images of deuterated methanol CH2DOH in Orion BN/KL observed with\nthe IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer from 1999 to 2007 in the 1 to 3 mm\nrange. Six CH2DOH lines were detected around 105.8, 223.5, and 225.9 GHz. In\naddition, three E-type methanol lines around 101-102 GHz were detected and were\nused to derive the corresponding CH3OH rotational temperatures and column\ndensities toward different regions across Orion BN/KL. The strongest CH2DOH and\nCH3OH emissions come from the Hot Core southwest region with an LSR velocity of\nabout 8 km/s. We derive [CH2DOH]/[CH3OH] abundance ratios of 0.8-1.3\\times10^-3\ntoward three CH2DOH emission peaks. A new transition of CH3OD was detected at\n226.2 GHz for the first time in the interstellar medium. Its distribution is\nsimilar to that of CH2DOH. Besides, we find that the [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] abundance\nratios are lower than unity in the central part of BN/KL. Furthermore, the HDO\n3(1,2)-2(2,1) line at 225.9 GHz was detected and its emission distribution\nshows a shift of a few arcseconds with respect to the deuterated methanol\nemission that likely results from different excitation effects. The deuteration\nratios derived along Orion BN/KL are not markedly different from one clump to\nanother. However, various processes such as slow heating due to ongoing star\nformation, heating by luminous infrared sources, or heating by shocks could be\ncompeting to explain some local differences observed for these ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 09:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We show that the deep absorption lines of the X-ray spectrum at\nmaximum, and nine days later, are well described by the following\nphenomenological model with emission from a central blackbody and from a\ncollisionally ionized plasma (CIE). The blackbody spectrum (BB) is absorbed by\nthree main highly-ionized expanding shells; the CIE and BB are absorbed by cold\ncircumstellar and interstellar matter that includes dust.

We show that the\nvariations on time scales of hours in the X-ray spectrum are caused by a\ncombination of variation in the central source and in the column density of the\nionized shells. Our phenomenological model gives the best description so far of\nthe supersoft X-ray spectrum of nova V2491 Cyg, but underpredicts, by a large\nfactor, the optical and ultraviolet flux. The X-ray part of the spectrum must\noriginate from a very different layer in the expanding envelope, presumably\nmuch closer to the white dwarf than the layers responsible for the\noptical/ultraviolet spectrum.

The standard ARCH or GARCH framework is recovered when the\nquadratic kernel is diagonal. The calibration of these models on US stock\nreturns reveals several unexpected features. The off-diagonal (non ARCH)\ncoefficients of the quadratic kernel are found to be highly significant both\nIn-Sample and Out-of-Sample, but all these coefficients turn out to be one\norder of magnitude smaller than the diagonal elements. This confirms that daily\nreturns play a special role in the volatility feedback mechanism, as postulated\nby ARCH models. The feedback kernel exhibits a surprisingly complex structure,\nincompatible with models proposed so far in the literature. Its spectral\nproperties suggest the existence of volatility-neutral patterns of past\nreturns. The diagonal part of the quadratic kernel is found to decay as a\npower-law of the lag, in line with the long-memory of volatility.

These two components support the possibility of a dual AGN system.\nThe weaker component remained undetected at 5 GHz, due to its steep radio\nspectrum.

A\nrange of frequencies higher than this equilibrium rotation frequency can\nnaturally arise if the accretion flow is channeled by higher multipoles of the\nstar's magnetic field. The higher multipole components of the magnetic field\nwill balance the material stresses of the accretion flow at radii closer to the\nstar. The Kepler frequencies associated with these generalized Alfven radii\nincrease with the order of the multipole. Other frequency bands, like the\nepicyclic frequencies associated with the accretion flow, may in turn be higher\nthan the Kepler frequencies. We present expressions for the spectrum of higher\nfrequencies arising due to these effects.

The very\nhigh QPO frequencies observed from the soft gamma repeaters SGR 1806-20 (P =\n5.2 s) and SGR 1900+14 (P = 7.5 s) may also correspond to these characteristic\nfrequencies if SGRs accrete from fallback disks around them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 12:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We find that the relative Gini entropy\nproduction introduced in the paper is not affected by the non-detailed balance\npart of the process. This property do not holds for other entropy definition in\ngeneral discrete case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 12:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

The most significant (at\nthe 4-sigma level) finding is that the average fitted AV from MLCS2k2 and c\nfrom SALT2 decrease with the projected distance for SNe Ia in spiral galaxies.\nWe also find indications that SNe in elliptical galaxies tend to have narrower\nlight-curves if they explode at larger distances, although this may be due to\nselection effects in our sample. We do not find strong correlations between the\nresiduals of the distance moduli with respect to the Hubble flow and the\ngalactocentric distances, which indicates a limited correlation between SN\nmagnitudes after standardization and local host metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 14:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}

Strictly speaking,\nthis contribution is not known theoretically, since it is beyond perturbative\nQCD. For DGLAP evolution all the infrared contributions are collected in the\nphenomenological input parton distribution functions (PDFs), at some relatively\nlow scale Q_0; functions which are obtained from a fit to the `global' data.\nHowever dimensional regularization sometimes produces a non-zero result coming\nfrom the infrared region. Instead of this conventional regularization\ntreatment, we argue that the proper procedure is to first subtract from the NLO\nmatrix element the contribution already generated at the same order in \\alpha_s\nby the LO DGLAP splitting function convoluted with the LO matrix element. This\nprescription eliminates the logarithmic infrared divergence, giving a\nwell-defined result which is consistent with the original idea that everything\nbelow Q_0 is collected in the PDF input.

For the non-thermal radio emission, subpulse\ndrifting phenomena suggest the existence of Ruderman-Sutherland-like\ngap-sparking and strong binding of particles on pulsar polar caps. While\nconventional neutron star models can hardly provide such a high binding energy,\nthe strong self-bound surface of quark-cluster stars can naturally solve this\nproblem. As for the thermal one, the featureless X-ray spectra of pulsars may\nindicate a bare surface without atmosphere, and the ultrarelativistic fireball\nof gamma-ray bursts and supernovae would also require strong self-bound\nsurfaces. Recent achievements in measuring pulsar mass and mass-radius relation\nfurther indicate a stiff equation of state and a self-bound surface. Therefore,\nwe conjecture that matters inside pulsar-like compact stars could be in a\nquark-cluster phase. The surface of quark-cluster stars is chromatically\nconfined and could initially be bare. Such a surface can not only explain above\nfeatures, but may also promote a successful core-collapse supernova, and the\nhydro-cyclotron oscillation of the electron sea above the surface could be\nresponsible for those absorption features detected in the X-ray spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 14:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

However, the intrinsic line asymmetry caused by\nconvective flows in the photospheres of cool stars is almost indistinguishable\nfrom the asymmetry produced by a weak 6Li blend on a (presumed) symmetric 7Li\nprofile. Previous determinations of the 6Li/ 7Li isotopic ratio based on 1D\nmodel atmospheres, ignoring the convection-induced line asymmetry, must\ntherefore be considered as upper limits. By comparing synthetic 1D LTE and 3D\nnon-LTE line profiles of the Li 670.8 nm feature, we quantify the differential\neffect of the convective line asymmetry on the derived 6Li abundance as a\nfunction of effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity. As expected, we\nfind that the asymmetry effect systematically reduces the resulting 6Li/7Li\nratios. Depending on the stellar parameters, the 3D-1D offset in 6Li/7Li ranges\nbetween -0.005 and -0.020. When this purely theoretical correction is taken\ninto account for the Asplund 2006 sample of stars, the number of significant\n6Li detections decreases from 9 to 5 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3\nsigma criterion).\n  We also present preliminary results of a re-analysis of high-resolution, high\nS/N spectra of individual metal-poor turn-off stars, to see whether the \"second\nLithium problem\" actually disappears when accounting properly for convection\nand non-LTE line formation in 3D stellar atmospheres. Out of 8 stars, HD84937\nseems to be the only significant (2 sigma) detection of 6Li. In view of our\nresults, the existence of a 6Li plateau appears questionable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 14:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}

In principle, effective field theories with their\nsystematic expansion and power counting could provide a tool to assess the\nvalidity of VMD and more generally to describe the interactions of vector\nmesons at low energies. Though the systematic development is still in an infant\nstage we present here a Lagrangian for light pseudoscalar and vector mesons\nwhich is inspired by ideas from effective field theories. The Lagrangian is\nused to calculate electromagnetic meson form factors. It turns out that one can\nreproduce both the successes of VMD concerning the pion form factors and the\ndeviations from VMD concerning the omega transition form factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 15:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-12"}
