As a result of ROR, one gets necessary and possible\npreference relations in the set of alternatives, which hold for all compatible\nsets of parameters or for at least one compatible set of parameters,\nrespectively. In this paper, we extend the MCDA methods based on ROR, by\nconsidering one important aspect of decision problems: imprecise evaluations.\nTo deal with imprecise evaluations of some alternatives on particular criteria,\nwe extend the set of considered variables to define necessary and possible\npreference relations taking into account this imprecision. In consequence, the\nconcepts of necessary and possible preference represent not only all compatible\nsets of parameters, but also all possible values of the imprecise evaluations\nof alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-28"}

Recent measurements of both of these effects on light\nnuclei have shown a clear deviation from simple density-dependent models.\nPurpose: A better understanding of the nuclear quark distributions and\nshort-range correlations requires a careful examination of the experimental\ndata on these effects to constrain models that attempt to describe these\nphenomena.\n  Methods: We present a detailed analysis of the nuclear dependence of the EMC\neffect and the contribution of SRCs in nuclei, comparing to predictions and\nsimple scaling models based on different pictures of the underlying physics. We\nalso make a direct, quantitative comparison of the two effects to further\nexamine the connection between these two observables related to nuclear\nstructure.\n  Results: We find that, with the inclusion of the new data on light nuclei,\nneither of these observables can be well explained by common assumptions for\nthe nuclear dependence. The anomalous behavior of both effects in light nuclei\nis consistent with the idea the the EMC effect is driven by either the presence\nof high-density configurations in nuclei or the large virtuality of the\nhighmomentum nucleons associated with these configurations.\n  Conclusions: The unexpected nuclear dependence in the measurements of the EMC\neffect and SRC contributions appear to suggest that the local environment of\nthe struck nucleon is the most relevant quantity for explaining these results.\nThe common behavior suggests a connection between the two seemingly disparate\nphenomena, but the data do not yet allow for a clear preference between models\nwhich aim to explain this connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 17:27:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 07:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 22:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 20:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The commonly cited\nage for the system (200+-100 Myr) from Barrado y Navascues et al. (1997) relied\non a combination of isochronal age plus youth indicators for the K4V common\nproper motion system TW PsA. TW PsA is 1.96 deg away from Fomalhaut, and was\nfirst proposed as a companion by Luyten (1938), but the physicality of the\nbinarity is worth testing with modern data. I demonstrate that TW PsA is\nunequivocally a physical stellar companion to Fomalhaut, with true separation\n0.280+0.019-0.012 pc (57.4+3.9-2.5 kAU) and sharing velocities within 0.1+-0.5\nkm/s -- consistent with being a bound system. Hence, TW PsA should be\nconsidered \"Fomalhaut B\". Combining modern HR diagram constraints with four\nsets of evolutionary tracks, and assuming the star was born with protosolar\ncomposition, I estimate a new isochronal age for Fomalhaut of 450+-40 Myr and\nmass of 1.92+-0.02 Msun. Various stellar youth diagnostics are re-examined for\nTW PsA. The star's rotation, X-ray emission, and Li abundances are consistent\nwith approximate ages of 410, 380, and 360 Myr, respectively, yielding a\nweighted mean age of 400+-70 Myr. Combining the independent ages, I estimate a\nmean age for the Fomalhaut-TW PsA binary of 440+-40 Myr. The older age implies\nthat substellar companions of a given mass are approximately one magnitude\nfainter at IR wavelengths than previously assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 18:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 20:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Just as the classical result provides a tradeoff between signal\nlocalization in time and frequency, this result provides a fundamental tradeoff\nbetween a signal's localization on a graph and in its spectral domain. Using\nthe eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian as a surrogate Fourier basis,\nquantitative definitions of graph and spectral \"spreads\" are given, and a\ncomplete characterization of the feasibility region of these two quantities is\ndeveloped. In particular, the lower boundary of the region, referred to as the\nuncertainty curve, is shown to be achieved by eigenvectors associated with the\nsmallest eigenvalues of an affine family of matrices. The convexity of the\nuncertainty curve allows it to be found to within $\\varepsilon$ by a fast\napproximation algorithm requiring $O(\\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ typically sparse\neigenvalue evaluations. Closed-form expressions for the uncertainty curves for\nsome special classes of graphs are derived, and an accurate analytical\napproximation for the expected uncertainty curve of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random\ngraphs is developed.

One field is centered about 2 arcmin\nfrom M32 while the other is located 15 arcmin to the southeast of M31. We\nidentify a total of 1139 RR Lyrae variables of which 821 are ab-type and 318\nare c-type. In the field near M32, we find a radial gradient in the density of\nRR Lyraes relative to the center of M32. This gradient is consistent with the\nsurface brightness profile of M32 suggesting that a significant number of the\nRR Lyraes in this region belong to M32. This provides further confirmation that\nM32 contains an ancient stellar population formed around the same time as the\noldest population in M31 and the Milky Way. The RR Lyrae stars in M32 exhibit a\nmean metal abundance of [Fe/H] ~ -1.42 +/- 0.02, which is ~15 times lower than\nthe metal abundance of the overall M32 stellar population. Moreover, the\nabundance of RR Lyrae stars normalized to the luminosity of M32 in the field\nanalyzed further indicates that the ancient metal-poor population in M32\nrepresents only a very minor component of this galaxy, consistent with the 1%\nto 4.5% in mass inferred from the CMD analysis of Monachesi et al. In the other\nfield, we find unprecedented evidence for two populations of RR Lyraes in M31\nas shown by two distinct sequences among the ab-type variables in the Bailey\nDiagram. When interpreted in terms of metal abundance, one population exhibits\na peak at [Fe/H] ~ -1.3 and the other is at [Fe/H] ~ -1.9. One possible\ninterpretation of this result is that the more metal-rich population represents\nthe dominant M31 halo, while the metal-poorer group could be a disrupted dwarf\nsatellite galaxy orbiting M31. If true, this represents a further indication\nthat the formation of the M31 spheroid has been significantly influenced by the\nmerger and accretion of dwarf galaxy satellites.

One possible method to alleviate this problem is to use a proxy,\nsuch as a Gaussian Process regressor, in place of the true scoring function,\ntraining it on a selection of sampled networks. We prove here that the use of\nsuch a proxy is well-founded, as we can bound the smoothness of a commonly-used\nscoring function for Bayesian network structure learning. We show here that,\ncompared to an identical search strategy using the network?s exact scores, our\nproxy-based search is able to get equivalent or better scores on a number of\ndata sets in a fraction of the time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

This motivates us to study batch active learning, which\niteratively selects batches of $k>1$ examples to be labeled. We propose a novel\nbatch active learning method that leverages the availability of high-quality\nand efficient sequential active-learning policies by attempting to approximate\ntheir behavior when applied for $k$ steps.

For low D<=2.2, the initial cloud is dominated by\nlarge-scale structures, so the neutral gas tends to be swept up into a few\nextended coherent shells, and the ionised gas blows out through a few large\nholes between these shells; we term these HII regions \"shell-dominated\".\nConversely, for high D>=2.6, the initial cloud is dominated by small-scale\nstructures, and these are quickly overrun by the advancing IF, thereby\nproducing neutral pillars whilst the ionised gas blows out through a large\nnumber of small holes between the pillars; we term these HII regions\n\"pillar-dominated\". (iii) As regards the injection of bulk kinetic energy, by\n~1Myr, the expansion of the HII region has delivered a rms velocity of ~6km/s;\nthis represents less than 0.1% of the total energy radiated by the O7 star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We consider several effects which determine the apparent value of U in\nHII regions and galaxies. An upper limit is set by the compression of gas by\nradiation pressure. The pressure from stellar winds and the presence of neutral\nclumps both reduce U for a given radiation intensity. The most intensely\nirradiated regions are selectively dimmed by internal dust absorption of\nionizing photons, inducing observational bias on galactic scales.

Unresolved starbursts display a maximum value of ~ -2.3.\nWhile lower, this is also consistent with a large portion of their HII regions\nbeing radiation dominated, given the different technique used to interpret\nunresolved regions, and given the bias caused by dust absorption.

In\nthis paper we present the results of computer modelling of light scattering by\naggregates that contain more than 1000 monomers of submicron size and study how\ntheir light scattering characteristics, specifically polarization, change with\nphase angle and wavelength. Such a modeling became possible due to development\nof a new version of MSTM (Multi Sphere T-Matrix) code for parallel computing.\nThe results of the modeling are applied to the results of comet polarimetric\nobservations to check if large aggregates dominate in formation of light\nscattering by comet dust. We compare aggregates of different structure and\nporosity. We show that large aggregates of more than 98% porosity (e.g.\nballistic cluster-cluster aggregates) have angular dependence of polarization\nalmost identical to the Rayleigh one. Large compact aggregates (less than 80%\nporosity) demonstrate the curves typical for solid particles. This rules out\ntoo porous and too compact aggregates as typical comet dust particles. We show\nthat large aggregates not only can explain phase angle dependence of comet\npolarization in the near infrared but also may be responsible for the\nwavelength dependence of polarization, which can be related to their porosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 20:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-11"}

The new formula for n particles in the k R-charge sector is an\nintegral over the Grassmannian G(2,n) and uses the Veronese map into G(k,n).\nThe image of a point in G(2,n) is required to be in the \"complement\" of a\n2|8-plane thus making the SU(8) R-symmetry manifest. The integrand is the ratio\nof two determinants. The numerator is an analog of Hodges' recent determinant\nformula for MHV amplitudes. The denominator is a 2(n+k-2) x 2(n+k-2) minor of a\n2(n+k) x 2(n+k) matrix of rank 2(n+k-2). Just as Hodges' formula does for MHV\namplitudes, our integrand makes the complete invariance under Sn manifest for\nall sectors.\n  The validity of the new formula follows from two surprising facts. One is the\nequivalence of Hodges' MHV formula and the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) formula\nwhen kinematic invariants are allowed to be off-shell in a novel way. We give a\nproof of this for any number of particles. The second fact is an orthogonality\nproperty of the solutions to the polynomial equations defining the Veronese\nembedding. Explicit proof of the orthogonality is given for all amplitudes in\nall R-charge sectors with eight or less particles thus providing non-trivial\nevidence for our proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 20:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-29"}

To track these\ninteractions we have conducted a suite of high-resolution (1500^3 effective) 3D\nsimulations that follow the evolution of individual clumps as they move into\nmolecular gas. Even at these high resolutions, our simulations do not quite\nachieve numerical convergence, due to the challenge of properly resolving the\nsmall-scale mixing of ejecta and molecular gas, although they do allow some\nrobust conclusions to be drawn. Isotropically exploding ejecta do not penetrate\ninto the molecular cloud, but, if cooling is properly accounted for, clumpy\nejecta penetrate to distances ~10^18 cm and mix effectively with star-forming\nmolecular gas. The ~2 M_\\odot high-metallicity ejecta from a core-collapse SN\nis likely to mix with ~2 \\times 10^4 M_\\odot of molecular gas. Thus all stars\nforming late (~5 Myr) in the evolution of an HII region may be contaminated by\nSN ejecta at a level ~10^-4. This level of contamination is consistent with the\nabundances of short-lived radionuclides and possibly some stable isotopic\nshifts in the early solar system, and is potentially consistent with the\nobserved variability in stellar elemental abundances. SN contamination of\nforming planetary systems may be a common, universal process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 20:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Since no physical process propagating at or below\nlightspeed could have brought them into thermal equilibrium, it appears that\nthe universe in its infancy required highly improbable initial conditions. In\nthis paper, we examine this well-known problem by considering photon\npropagation through a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime at a more\nfundamental level than has been attempted before, demonstrating that the\nhorizon problem only emerges for a subset of FRW cosmologies, such as LCDM,\nthat include an early phase of rapid deceleration.

This transition can be induced by tuning the bandwidth of the Landau\nlevel relative to the interaction energy, for instance through an externally\napplied periodic potential. We find a transition to the Landau Fermi liquid\nthrough a gapless Mott insulator with a Fermi surface of neutral fermionic\nexcitations. In the presence of spatial symmetries, we also find a direct\ncontinuous transition between the CFL and the Landau Fermi liquid.

In the present paper the Burgers-Hopf dynamics truncated to n\nFourier modes is treated by a new statistical model reduction technique, and a\nclosed system of evolution equations for the mean values of the m lowest modes\nis derived for m << n. In the reduced model the m-mode macrostates are\nassociated with trial probability densities on the phase space of the n-mode\nmicrostates, and a cost functional is introduced to quantify the lack of fit of\npaths of these densities to the Liouville equation.

The\nresulting reduced equations have a fractional diffusion and modified nonlinear\ninteractions, and the explicit form of both are determined up to a single\nclosure parameter.

Next the self\nsimilarity of the collapse of cold dynamical systems is investigated\nnumerically. The fold system in phase space is consistent with analytic self\nsimilar solutions, the solutions present all the proper self-similar scalings.\nAn additional point is the appearance of an $x^{-(1/2)}$ law at the center of\nthe system for initial conditions with power law index larger than $-(1/2)$. It\nis found that the first appearance of the $x^{-(1/2)}$ law corresponds to the\nformation of a singularity very close to the center. Finally the general\nproperties of self similar multi dimensional solutions near equilibrium are\ninvestigated. Smooth and continuous self similar solutions have power law\nbehavior at equilibrium. However cold initial conditions result in\ndiscontinuous phase space solutions, and the smoothed phase space density\nlooses its auto similar properties. This problem is easily solved by observing\nthat the probability distribution of the phase space density $P$ is identical\nexcept for scaling parameters to the probability distribution of the smoothed\nphase space density $P_S$. As a consequence $P_S$ inherit the self similar\nproperties of $P$. This particular property is at the origin of the universal\npower law observed in numerical simulation for ${\\rho}/{\\sigma^3}$. The self\nsimilar properties of $P_S$ implies that other quantities should have also an\nuniversal power law behavior with predictable exponents.

The continuous dynamics leads to a hierarchy of Fokker-Planck\nequations, indexed by channel occupancy. From these the mean escape times and\nsplitting probabilities (denoting from which side an ion has escaped) can be\ncalculated. By equating these with the corresponding expressions from the\nMarkov model the Markovian transition rates can be determined. The theory is\nillustrated with a two-ion one-well channel.

The kinetic counterparts of the three familiar linear\nMHD wave modes---the fast, Alfven, and slow waves---are identified and the\nproperties of the density-parallel magnetic field correlation for these kinetic\nwave modes is presented. The construction of synthetic spacecraft data, based\non the quasi-linear premise---that some characteristics of magnetized plasma\nturbulence can be usefully modeled as a collection of randomly phased, linear\nwave modes---is described in detail. Theoretical predictions of the\ndensity-parallel magnetic field correlation based on MHD and Vlasov-Maxwell\nlinear eigenfunctions are presented and compared to the observational\ndetermination of this correlation based on 10 years of Wind spacecraft data. It\nis demonstrated that MHD theory is inadequate to describe the compressible\nturbulent fluctuations and that the observed density-parallel magnetic field\ncorrelation is consistent with a statistically negligible kinetic fast wave\nenergy contribution for the large sample used in this study. A model of the\nsolar wind inertial range fluctuations is proposed comprised of a mixture of a\ncritically balanced distribution of incompressible Alfvenic fluctuations and a\ncritically balanced or more anisotropic than critical balance distribution of\ncompressible slow wave fluctuations.

We find the entire source sample\nto have a median spectral index of 0.74, in good agreement with both the\ncanonical value of 0.7 for optically thin synchrotron radiation and other\nspectral index studies conducted by various groups. Regarding the radio\nspectral index as indicator for source type, we find only marginal correlations\nso that flat or inverted spectrum sources are usually powered by AGN and hence\nconclude that at least for the faint population the spectral index is not a\nstrong discriminator. We investigate relation between spectral index and\nredshift for our source sample and find no such correlation at all.

One of the consequences of this remote\ncoupling is a phenomenon called Coulomb drag, in which an electric current\npassed through one of the layers causes frictional charge flow in the other\nlayer. Previously, only the regime of weak (d>>l) to intermediate (d ~ l)\ncoupling could be studied experimentally. Here we use graphene-BN\nheterostructures with d down to 1 nm to probe interlayer interactions and\nCoulomb drag in the limit d<<l where the two Dirac liquids effectively nest\nwithin the same plane, but still can be tuned and measured independently. The\nstrongly interacting regime reveals many unpredicted features that are\nqualitatively different from those observed previously. In particular, although\ndrag vanishes because of electron-hole symmetry when either layer is neutral,\nwe find that drag is at its strongest when /both/ layers are neutral. Under\nthis circumstance, drag is positive in zero magnetic field but changes its sign\nand rapidly grows in strength with field. The drag remains strong at room\ntemperature. The broken electron-hole symmetry is attributed to mutual\npolarization of closely-spaced interacting layers. The two-fluid Dirac system\noffers a large parameter space for further investigation of strong interlayer\ninteraction phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 10:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-05"}

We argue that the\nnecessity of such an improvement arises naturally in astrophysically relevant\nregimes where the optical thickness is high as the equations become stiff. By\nperforming several 1D tests we verify the codes' new ability to deal with this\nstiffness and show consistency. Then, still in 1D, we compute a luminosity\nversus accretion rate diagram for the setup of spherical accretion onto a\nSchwarzschild black hole and find good agreement with previous work. Lastly, we\nrevisit the supersonic Bondi Hoyle Lyttleton (BHL) accretion in 2D where we can\nnow present simulations of realistic temperatures, down to T~10^6 K. Here we\nfind that radiation pressure plays an important role, but also that these\nhighly dynamical set-ups push our approximate treatment towards the limit of\nphysical applicability. The main features of radiation hydrodynamics BHL flows\nmanifest as (i) an effective adiabatic index approaching gamma_effective ~ 4/3;\n(ii) accretion rates two orders of magnitude lower than without radiation\npressure; (iii) luminosity estimates around the Eddington limit, hence with an\noverall radiative efficiency as small as eta ~ 10^{-2}; (iv) strong departures\nfrom thermal equilibrium in shocked regions; (v) no appearance of the flip-flop\ninstability. We conclude that the current optically thick approximation to the\nradiation transfer does give physically substantial improvements over the pure\nhydro also in set-ups departing from equilibrium, and, once accompanied by an\noptically thin treatment, is likely to provide a fundamental tool for\ninvestigating accretion flows in a large variety of astrophysical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 12:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 12:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Most studies on the Raman effect in optical\nfibers assume a scalar model, which is only valid for high-PMD fibers (here,\nPMD stands for the polarization-mode dispersion). Modern technology enables\nmanufacturing of low-PMD fibers, the description of which requires a full\nvectorial model. Within this model we gain full control over the SOP of the\nsignal beam. In particular we show how the signal SOP is pulled towards and\ntrapped by the pump SOP. The isotropic symmetry of the fiber is broken by the\npresence of the polarized pump. This trapping effect is used in experiments for\nthe design of new nonlinear optical devices named Raman polarizers. Along with\nthe property of improved signal amplification, these devices transform an\narbitrary input SOP of the signal beam into one and the same SOP towards the\noutput end. This output SOP is fully controlled by the SOP of the pump beam.

Likelihood-based methods then require the optimization\nof a profile likelihood that takes all possible missingness mechanisms into\naccount. Optimzing this profile likelihood poses two main difficulties:\nmultiple (local) maxima, and its very high-dimensional parameter space. In this\npaper a new method is presented for optimizing the profile likelihood that\naddresses the second difficulty: in the proposed AI&M (adjusting imputation and\nmazimization) procedure the optimization is performed by operations in the\nspace of data completions, rather than directly in the parameter space of the\nprofile likelihood.

The mathematical framework of Continuous Time Markov\nProcesses provides the basic foundations for modeling such systems. Recently,\nNodelman et al introduced continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs), which\nallow a compact representation of continuous-time processes over a factored\nstate space. In this paper, we introduce continuous time Markov networks\n(CTMNs), an alternative representation language that represents a different\ntype of continuous-time dynamics. In many real life processes, such as\nbiological and chemical systems, the dynamics of the process can be naturally\ndescribed as an interplay between two forces - the tendency of each entity to\nchange its state, and the overall fitness or energy function of the entire\nsystem. In our model, the first force is described by a continuous-time\nproposal process that suggests possible local changes to the state of the\nsystem at different rates. The second force is represented by a Markov network\nthat encodes the fitness, or desirability, of different states; a proposed\nlocal change is then accepted with a probability that is a function of the\nchange in the fitness distribution. We show that the fitness distribution is\nalso the stationary distribution of the Markov process, so that this\nrepresentation provides a characterization of a temporal process whose\nstationary distribution has a compact graphical representation. This allows us\nto naturally capture a different type of structure in complex dynamical\nprocesses, such as evolving biological sequences.

Knowing the second derivative allows a vehicle to slow down in\nadvance of rough terrain. Estimating the second derivative is challenging due\nto uncertainty. For example, at range, laser readings may be so sparse that\nsignificant information about the surface is missing. Also, a high degree of\nprecision is required in projecting laser readings. This precision may be\nunavailable due to latency or error in the pose estimation. We model these\nsources of error as a multivariate polynomial.

The resulting classifier operates on individual laser readings from\na road surface described by a 3D point cloud. The classifier identifies\nsections of road where the second derivative is likely to be large. Thus, the\nvehicle can slow down in advance, reducing the shock it experiences.
