We\nbase our relations on a large set of low-mass stars in the field with Halpha\nactivity measurements, and on a set of low-mass eclipsing binaries with X-ray\nactivity measurements from which we indirectly infer the Halpha activity. Both\nsamples yield consistent relations linking the amount by which an active\nobject's temperature is suppressed, and its radius inflated, to the strength of\nits Halpha emission. These relations are found to approximately preserve\nbolometric luminosity. We apply these relations to the peculiar brown-dwarf\neclipsing binary 2M0535-05, in which the active, higher-mass brown dwarf has a\ncooler temperature than its inactive, lower-mass companion. The relations\ncorrectly reproduce the observed temperatures and radii of 2M0535-05 after\naccounting for the Halpha emission; 2M0535-05 would be in precise agreement\nwith theoretical isochrones were it inactive.

For example,\ngeneral relativity provides an effective description of the Universe at large\nlength scales, and has been tested from the cosmic scale down to distances as\nsmall as 10 meters. In contrast, quantum theory provides an effective\ndescription of physics at small length scales. Direct tests of quantum theory\nhave been performed at the smallest probeable scales at the Large Hadron\nCollider, ${\\sim} 10^{-20}$ meters, up to that of hundreds of kilometers. Yet,\nsuch tests fall short of the scales required to investigate potentially\nsignificant physics that arises at the intersection of quantum and relativistic\nregimes. We propose to push direct tests of quantum theory to larger and larger\nlength scales, approaching that of the radius of curvature of spacetime, where\nwe begin to probe the interaction between gravity and quantum phenomena. In\nparticular, we review a wide variety of potential tests of fundamental physics\nthat are conceivable with artificial satellites in Earth orbit and elsewhere in\nthe solar system, and attempt to sketch the magnitudes of potentially\nobservable effects. The tests have the potential to determine the applicability\nof quantum theory at larger length scales, eliminate various alternative\nphysical theories, and place bounds on phenomenological models motivated by\nideas about spacetime microstructure from quantum gravity.

In addition to the standard power-law contribution, which\ncorresponds to the excitation of multiple particle-hole pairs near the Fermi\nsurface, we identify a novel contribution to OC that comes from exciting one\nextra particle from the bottom of the itinerant band. This gives rise to a\nnon-analytic feature in the RF absorption spectra, which evolves into a true\npower-law singularity with universal exponent 1/4 at the unitarity.\nFurthermore, we discuss the manifestations of OC in spin-echo experiments, as\nwell as in the energy counting statistic of the Fermi gas following a sudden\nquench of the impurity state. Finally, systems in which the itinerant fermions\nhave two or more hyperfine states provide an even richer playground for\nstudying non-equilibrium impurity physics, allowing one to explore\nnon-equilibrium OC and to simulate quantum transport through nano-structures.\nThis provides a useful connection between cold atomic systems and mesoscopic\nquantum transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 18:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

Given a parametrized family of\nprobability distributions on the search space, the IGO turns an arbitrary\noptimization problem on the search space into an optimization problem on the\nparameter space of the probability distribution family and defines a natural\ngradient ascent on this space. From the natural gradients defined over the\nentire parameter space we obtain continuous time trajectories which are the\nsolutions of an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Via discretization, the\nIGO naturally defines an iterated gradient ascent algorithm. Depending on the\nchosen distribution family, the IGO recovers several known algorithms such as\nthe pure rank-\\mu update CMA-ES. Consequently, the continuous time\nIGO-trajectory can be viewed as an idealization of the original algorithm. In\nthis paper we study the continuous time trajectories of the IGO given the\nfamily of isotropic Gaussian distributions.

We first develop general results for what\nwe call CFTP times with ambiguities. These are analogous to classical coupling\n(from the past) times, except that the coupling property holds only provided\nthat some ambiguities concerning the stochastic evolution of the system are\nresolved. If these ambiguities are rare enough on average, CFTP times with\nambiguities can be used to build actual CFTP times, whose properties can be\ncontrolled in terms of those of the original CFTP time with ambiguities. We\nthen prove a general perturbation result, which can be stated informally as\nfollows. Start with an interacting particle system possessing a CFTP time whose\ndefinition involves the exploration of an exponentially integrable number of\npoints in the graphical construction, and which satisfies the positive rates\nproperty. Then consider a perturbation obtained by adding new transitions to\nthe original dynamics. Our result states that, provided that the perturbation\nis small enough (in the sense of small enough rates), the perturbed interacting\nparticle system too possesses a CFTP time (with nice properties such as an\nexponentially decaying tail). The proof consists in defining a CFTP time with\nambiguities for the perturbed dynamics, from the CFTP time for the unperturbed\ndynamics. Finally, we discuss examples of particle systems to which this result\ncan be applied. Concrete examples include a class of neighbor-dependent\nnucleotide substitution model, and variations of the classical voter model,\nillustrating the ability of our approach to go beyond the case of weakly\ninteracting particle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 19:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}

For the overall [alpha/Fe] ratio, we obtain an\noverabundance of 0.36dex, which is in very good agreement with results from\nmetal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo as well as from the metal-poor tail in\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies. Comparing the abundances with those of the stars in\nthe Milky Way halo we find that the abundance ratios of stars of both\npopulations are consistent with another. Therefore we conclude that from a\nchemical point of view early contributions from Magellanic-type galaxies to the\nformation of the Galactic halo as claimed in cosmological models are plausible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Four types of methods are investigated,\nnamely classical and Bayesian hypothesis testing, a reliability-based method,\nand an area metric-based method. Traditional Bayesian hypothesis testing is\nextended based on interval hypotheses on distribution parameters and equality\nhypotheses on probability distributions, in order to validate models with\ndeterministic/stochastic output for given inputs. Two types of validation\nexperiments are considered - fully characterized (all the model/experimental\ninputs are measured and reported as point values) and partially characterized\n(some of the model/experimental inputs are not measured or are reported as\nintervals). Bayesian hypothesis testing can minimize the risk in model\nselection by properly choosing the model acceptance threshold, and its results\ncan be used in model averaging to avoid Type I/II errors. It is shown that\nBayesian interval hypothesis testing, the reliability-based method, and the\narea metric-based method can account for the existence of directional bias,\nwhere the mean predictions of a numerical model may be consistently below or\nabove the corresponding experimental observations. It is also found that under\nsome specific conditions, the Bayes factor metric in Bayesian equality\nhypothesis testing and the reliability-based metric can both be mathematically\nrelated to the p-value metric in classical hypothesis testing.

As the projected radial coordinate is\nincreased, a radius appears beyond which, the measured velocity dispersion\nceases to drop and settles at a fixed value, $\\sigma_{\\infty}$. Under Newtonian\ngravity, this is explained by invoking tidal heating from the overall Milky Way\npotential on the outer, more loosely bound stars, of the globular clusters in\nquestion. From the point of view of modified gravity theories, such an outer\nflattening is expected on crossing the critical acceleration threshold $a_{0}$,\nbeyond which, a transition to MONDian dynamics is expected, were equilibrium\nvelocities cease to be a function of distance. In this paper we attempt to sort\nout between the above competing explanations, by looking at their plausibility\nin terms of an strictly empirical approach. We determine Newtonian tidal radii\nusing masses accurately calculated through stellar population modelling, and\nhence independent of any dynamical assumptions, distances, size and orbital\ndeterminations for a sample of 16 globular clusters. We show that their\nNewtonian tidal radii at perigalacticon are generally larger that the radii at\nwhich the flattening in the velocity dispersion profiles occurs, by large\nfactors of 4, on average. While this point makes the Newtonian tidal\nexplanation suspect, it is found that the radii at which the flattening is\nobserved on average correlate with the radii where the $a_{0}$ threshold is\ncrossed, and that $\\sigma_{\\infty}$ values scale with the fourth root of the\ntotal masses, all features predicted under modified gravity theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2012 21:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 16:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Thus far, discussions on this topic have mostly assumed that in a\nconsistent theory of gravity and quantum mechanics, quantum theory will be\nunmodified. Here, we examine the black hole information problem in the context\nof generalisations of quantum theory. In particular, we examine black holes in\nthe setting of generalised probabilistic theories, in which quantum theory and\nclassical probability theory are special cases. We compute the time it takes\ninformation to escape a black hole, assuming that information is preserved. We\nfind that under some very general assumptions, the arguments of Page (that\ninformation should escape the black hole after half the Hawking photons have\nbeen emitted), and the black-hole mirror result of Hayden and Preskill (that\ninformation can escape quickly) need to be modified.

Finally, we perform\nmean field calculations for the uniform and confined systems and show the\nresults to be in good agreement with QMC. This leads to a simple picture of the\ndifferent pairing mechanisms, depending on the filling and confining potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 04:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This can be attributed to an increase in the angular sizes\nof the \\muas-scale cores or a decrease in the flux densities of the compact\n\\muas cores relative to that of the mas-scale components with increasing\nredshift, possibly arising from (1) the space-time curvature of an expanding\nUniverse, (2) AGN evolution, (3) source selection biases, (4) scatter\nbroadening in the ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening galaxies,\nor (5) gravitational lensing. We examine the frequency scaling of this redshift\ndependence of ISS to determine its origin, using data from a dual-frequency\nsurvey of ISS of 128 sources at 0 < z < 4. We present a novel method of\nanalysis which accounts for selection effects in the source sample. We\ndetermine that the redshift dependence of ISS is partially linked to the\nsteepening of source spectral indices ({\\alpha}^8.4_4.9) with redshift, caused\neither by selection biases or AGN evolution, coupled with weaker ISS in the\n{\\alpha}^8.4_4.9 < -0.4 sources.

We find no significant evidence for scatter\nbroadening in the IGM, ruling it out as the main cause of the redshift\ndependence of ISS.

Recent studies on\nMAC scheduling have shown that carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) can be\ncontrolled to be achieve optimality in terms of throughput or utility. These\nresults imply that just a simple MAC algorithm without message passing is\npossible to achieve high performance guarantee. However, such studies are\nconducted only on the assumption that channel conditions are static. Noting\nthat the main drive for achieving optimality in optimal CSMA is to let it run a\ngood schedule for some time, formally referred to as the mixing time, it is\nunder-explored how such optimal CSMA performs for time-varying channel\nconditions. In this paper, under the practical constraint of restricted\nback-off rates (i.e., limited sensing speed), we consider two versions of\nCSMAs: (i) channel-unaware CSMA (U-CSMA) and (ii) channel-aware CSMA (A-CSMA),\neach of which is characterized as its ability of tracking channel conditions.\nWe first show that for fast channel variations, A-CSMA achieves almost zero\nthroughput, implying that incomplete tracking of channel conditions may\nseriously degrade performance, whereas U-CSMA, accessing the media without\nexplicit consideration of channel conditions, has positive worst-case guarantee\nin throughput, where the ratio of guarantee depends on network topology. On the\nother hand, for slow channel variations, we prove that A-CSMA is\nthroughput-optimal for any network topology. Our results provide the precise\ntrade-off between sensing costs and performances of CSMA algorithms, which\nguides a robust design on MAC scheduling under highly time-varying scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 05:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 08:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 06:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

This second-generation formalism\nincorporates \"recursive nonlinearities\": the process by which\nalready-established metric perturbations will then act to slow down all future\nflows of inhomogeneity information. Here, the long-range effects of causal\nbackreaction are now damped, weakening its impact for models that were\npreviously best-fit cosmologies. Nevertheless, we find that causal backreaction\ncan be recovered as a replacement for Dark Energy via the adoption of larger\nvalues for the dimensionless `strength' of the clustering evolution functions\nbeing modeled -- a change justified by the hierarchical nature of clustering\nand virialization in the universe, occurring on multiple cosmic length scales\nsimultaneously. With this, and with one new model parameter representing the\nslowdown of clustering due to astrophysical feedback processes, an alternative\ncosmic concordance can once again be achieved for a matter-only universe in\nwhich the apparent acceleration is generated entirely by causal backreaction\neffects. One drawback is a new degeneracy which broadens our predicted range\nfor the observed jerk parameter $j_{0}^{\\mathrm{Obs}}$, thus removing what had\nappeared to be a clear signature for distinguishing causal backreaction from\nCosmological Constant $\\Lambda$CDM. As for the long-term fate of the universe,\nincorporating recursive nonlinearities appears to make the possibility of an\n`eternal' acceleration due to causal backreaction far less likely; though this\ndoes not take into account gravitational nonlinearities or the large-scale\nbreakdown of cosmological isotropy, effects not easily modeled within this\nformalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 05:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-23"}

The conditionality principle, the\nsufficiency principle and the likelihood principle are generalized, and a\ntentative rule for when one should not condition on an ancillary is motivated\nby examples. The theory is illustrated by the case where a nuisance parameter\nis a part of the context, and for this case, model reduction is motivated.\nModel reduction is discussed in general from the point of view that there\nexists a mathematical group acting upon the parameter space.

Using a Boltzmann equation approach we study a variety\nof limits ranging from the non-degenerate interaction dominated limit close to\ncharge neutrality all the way to the Fermi liquid regime. In the non-degenerate\nlimit we find that the presence of the passive layer can largely influence the\nconductivity of the active layer despite the absence of drag. This induces a\nnon-trivial temperature behavior of the single layer conductivity and\nfurthermore suggests a promising strategy towards increasing the role of\ninelastic scattering in future experiments. For small but finite chemical\npotential we find that the drag resistivity varies substantially as a function\nof the ratio of inelastic and elastic scattering.

This\ntransition has recently been observed experimentally in a variety of physical\nsystems. Until now, theoretical studies of the PT phase transition have\ngenerally been limited to one-dimensional models. Here, four nontrivial coupled\nPT-symmetric Hamiltonians, $H=p^2/2+x^2/2+q^2/2+y^2/2+igx^2y$,\n$H=p^2/2+x^2/2+q^2/2+y^2+igx^2y$,\n$H=p^2/2+x^2/2+q^2/2+y^2/2+r^2/2+z^2/2+igxyz$, and\n$H=p^2/2+x^2/2+q^2/2+y^2+r^2/2+3z^2/2+igxyz$ are examined.

Using Bogoliubov-de\nGennes linearization as well as direct numerical simulations of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, we observe dark solitary waves, which can become\nunstable through oscillatory or exponential instabilities. We find a critical\nwavelength of the nonlinear lattice that is comparable to the healing length.\nNear this value, the fundamental eigenmode responsible for the stability of the\ndark solitary wave changes its direction of movement as a function of the\nstrength of the nonlinearity. When it increases, it collides with other\neigenmodes, leading to oscillatory instabilities; when it decreases, it\ncollides with the origin and becomes imaginary, illustrating that the\ninstability mechanism is fundamentally different in wide-well versus\nnarrow-well lattices. When starting from a collisionally homogeneous setup and\nswitching on inhomogeneities, we find that dark solitary waves are preserved\ngenerically for aligned lattices. We briefly examine the time scales for the\nonset of solitary-wave oscillations in this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 13:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 00:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

The beginning of the story dates\nback to a pioneering work by Hilbert, who first formalized the concept of\nlinearization of the collision operator and pointed out the importance of its\neigenvalues with respect to a certain asymptotic behavior of the Boltzmann\nequation. Under really mild conditions on initial data - close to being\nnecessary - and a weak, physically consistent, angular cutoff hypothesis, our\nmain result (Theorem 1.1) contains the first precise statement that the total\nvariation distance between the solution and the limiting Maxwellian\ndistribution admits an upper bound of the form C e^{Lambda_b t}, Lambda_b being\nthe least negative of the aforesaid eigenvalues and C a constant which depends\nonly on a few simple numerical characteristics (e.g. moments) of the initial\ndatum. The validity of this quantification was conjectured, about fifty years\nago, in a paper by Henry P. McKean but, in spite of several attempts, the best\nanswer known up to now consists in a bound with a rate which can be made\narbitrarily close to Lambda_b, to the cost of the \"explosion\" of the constant\nC. Moreover, its deduction is subject to restrictive hypotheses on the initial\ndatum, besides the Grad angular cutoff condition. As to the proof of our\nresults, we have taken as point of reference an analogy between the problem of\nconvergence to equilibrium and the central limit theorem of probability theory,\nhighlighted by McKean. Our work represents in fact a confirmation of this\nanalogy, since the techniques we develop here crucially rely on certain\nformulations of the central limit theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2012 13:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-25"}

The proposed method relies on the concept of the \"universality\" or\n\"local nuclear character\" of the SRC. We quantify the SRC by computing the\nnumber of independent-particle model (IPM) nucleon pairs and triples which\nreveal beyond-mean-field behavior. It is argued that those can be identified by\ncounting the number of nucleon pairs and triples in a zero relative orbital\nmomentum state. A method to determine the quantum numbers of pairs and triples\nin an arbitrary mean-field basis is outlined. The mass dependence of the 2N and\n3N SRC is studied.

Predicted theoretically\nin the early sixties, the spin-charge separation has attracted renewed\nattention since the first evidences of experimental observation, with usual\nmentions as a possible explanation for high-temperature superconductivity. In\none-dimensional (1D) model systems, the spin-charge separation leads the\nfrequencies of Friedel oscillations to suffer a 2k_F -- 4k_F crossover, mainly\nwhen dealing with strong correlations, where they are referred to as Wigner\ncrystal oscillations.

We used turn-based stochastic parity games to define acceptance of\nMarkov chains by a subclass of p-automata. Definition of acceptance required a\ncumbersome and complicated reduction to a series of turn-based stochastic\nparity games. The reduction could not support acceptance by general p-automata,\nwhich was left undefined as there was no notion of games that supported it.\n  Here we generalize two-player games by adding a structural acceptance\ncondition called obligations. Obligations are orthogonal to the linear winning\nconditions that define winning. Obligations are a declaration that player 0 can\nachieve a certain value from a configuration. If the obligation is met, the\nvalue of that configuration for player 0 is 1.\n  One cannot define value in obligation games by the standard mechanism of\nconsidering the measure of winning paths on a Markov chain and taking the\nsupremum of the infimum of all strategies. Mainly because obligations need\ndefinition even for Markov chains and the nature of obligations has the flavor\nof an infinite nesting of supremum and infimum operators. We define value via a\nreduction to turn-based games similar to Martin's proof of determinacy of\nBlackwell games with Borel objectives. Based on this definition, we show that\ngames are determined. We show that for Markov chains with Borel objectives and\nobligations, and finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations\nthere exists an alternative and simpler characterization of the value function.\nBased on this simpler definition we give an exponential time algorithm to\nanalyze finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations.

The atoms are confined\nby an external optical lattice, whose period is incommensurate with the cavity\nmode wave length, and are driven by a transverse laser, which is resonant with\nthe cavity mode. While for pointlike atoms photon scattering into the cavity is\nsuppressed, for sufficiently strong lasers quantum fluctuations can support the\nbuild-up of an intracavity field, which in turn amplifies quantum fluctuations.\nThe dynamics is described by a Bose-Hubbard model where the coefficients due to\nthe cavity field depend on the atomic density at all lattice sites. Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations and mean-field calculations show that for large\nparameter regions cavity backaction forces the atoms into clusters with a\ncheckerboard density distribution.
