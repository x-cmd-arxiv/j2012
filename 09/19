When masses are equal the physical situation is known to be quite\nsimple. We show that, when the mass ratio is increased, the situation becomes\nmuch more complex. For the s-wave contribution we obtain an analytical solution\nin the asymptotic limit of very large mass ratio. In this regime the s-wave\nscattering amplitude displays a large number of zeros, essentially linked to\nthe known large value of the fermion-dimer scattering length in this regime. We\nfind by an exact numerical calculation that a zero is still present for a mass\nratio of 15. For the p-wave contribution we make our study below the mass ratio\nof 8.17, where a fermion-dimer bound state appears. We find that a strong\np-wave resonance is present at low energy, due to a virtual bound state, in the\nfermion-dimer system, which is a forerunner of the real bound state. This\nresonance becomes prominent in the mass ratio range around the one\ncorresponding to the $^{40}$K - $^6$Li mixtures, much studied experimentally.\nThis resonance should affect a number of physical properties. These include the\nequation of state of unbalanced mixtures at very low temperature but also the\nequation of state of balanced mixtures at moderate or high temperature. The\nfrequency and the damping of collective modes should also provide a convenient\nway to evidence this resonance. Finally it should be possible to modify the\neffective mass of one of the fermionic species by making use of an optical\nlattice. This would allow to study the strong dependence of the resonance as a\nfunction of the mass ratio of the two fermionic elements. In particular one\ncould check if the virtual bound state is relevant for the instabilities of\nthese mixtures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 16:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Mok's\ntheorem) in Sasaki geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 16:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-19"}

However, the use of particle flow calorimetry at the\nproposed multi-TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) poses a number of significant\nnew challenges. At higher jet energies, detector occupancies increase, and it\nbecomes increasingly difficult to resolve energy deposits from individual\nparticles. The experimental conditions at CLIC are also significantly more\nchallenging than those at previous electron-positron colliders, with increased\nlevels of beam-induced backgrounds combined with a bunch spacing of only 0.5\nns. This paper describes the modifications made to the PandoraPFA particle flow\nalgorithm to improve the jet energy reconstruction for jet energies above 250\nGeV. It then introduces a combination of timing and p_T cuts that can be\napplied to reconstructed particles in order to significantly reduce the\nbackground. A systematic study is performed to understand the dependence of the\njet energy resolution on the jet energy and angle, and the physics performance\nis assessed via a study of the energy and mass resolution of W and Z particles\nin the presence of background at CLIC. Finally, the missing transverse momentum\nresolution is presented, and the fake missing momentum is quantified. The\nresults presented in this paper demonstrate that high granularity particle flow\ncalorimetry leads to a robust and high resolution reconstruction of jet\nenergies and di-jet masses at CLIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 17:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Using several hydrodynamical simulations we have investigated the most\nprominent tidal tail formed during the first passage, which is gas-rich and\ncontains old and metal poor stars. We discovered several striking coincidences\nafter comparing its location and motion to those of the Milky Way (MW) and of\nthe Magellanic Clouds (MCs). First, the tidal tail is sweeping a relatively\nsmall volume in which the MW precisely lies. Because the geometry of the merger\nis somehow fixed by the anisotropic properties of the Giant Stream (GS), we\nevaluate the chance of the MW to be at such a rendez-vous with this gigantic\ntidal tail to be 5 %. Second, the velocity of the tidal tail matches the LMC\nproper motion, and reproduce quite well the geometrical and angular momentum\nproperties of the MW dwarfs, i.e. the so-called disk of satellites, better\ncalled Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). Third, the simulation of the tidal tail\nreveals one of the formed TDG with mass and location almost comparable to those\nof the LMC. Our present modeling is however too limited to study the detailed\ninteraction of gas-rich TDGs with the potential of the MW, and a complementary\nstudy is required to test whether the dwarf intrinsic properties can be\naccounted for by our scenario.

Methods: To that end, we utilize the results of the\nstate-of-the-art calculations by Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012) comprising direct\nN-body computations of realistic, binary-rich, mass-segregated models of R136.\nIn particular, these calculations provide the ejection fraction of stars as a\nfunction of stellar mass. Results: We find that if the measured IMF of R136 is\ngranted to be canonical, as observations indicate, then the \"true\" high-mass\nIMF of R136 at its birth must be at least moderately top-heavy when corrected\nfor the dynamical escape of massive stars. Conclusions: The top-heaviness of\nthe true high-mass IMF over the observationally determined one is a general\nfeature of massive, young clusters where the dynamical ejection of massive\nstars is efficient. We discuss its implications and possible improvements over\nour current estimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Here, we use a large suite of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations to study measurement biases of f_gas. We employ\ndifferent variants of simulated physics, including radiative gas physics, star\nformation, and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. Computing the mass\nprofiles in 48 angular cones, whose footprints partition the sphere, we find\nanisotropic gas and total mass distributions that imply an angular variance of\nf_gas at the level of 30%. This anisotropic distribution originates from the\nrecent formation epoch of clusters and from the strong internal\nbaryon-to-dark-matter density bias. In the most extreme cones, f_gas can be\nbiased high by a factor of two at R_200 in massive clusters, thereby providing\na potential explanation for high f_gas measurements by Suzaku. While projection\nlowers this factor, there are other measurement biases that may (partially)\ncompensate. We find that at R_200, f_gas is biased high by 20% when assuming\nhydrostatic equilibrium masses, i.e., neglecting the kinetic pressure, and by\nanother ~10-20% due to the presence of density clumping. At larger radii, both\nmeasurement biases increase dramatically. While the cluster sample variance of\nthe true f_gas decreases to a level of 5% at R_200, the sample variance that\nincludes both measurement biases remains fairly constant at the level of\n10-20%.

As a result, the effect of a\nselective advantage is amplified relative to genetic drift, increasing the\nsurvival probability of advantageous mutants.

Unlike previous studies, the effects of the object on off-diagonal\nelements of the OAM correlation matrix are examined. Due to the presence of the\nobject, terms appear in which the signal and idler OAM do not add up to that of\nthe pump. Using these off-diagonal correlations, the potential for\nhigh-efficiency object identification by means of correlated OAM states is\nexperimentally demonstrated for the first time. The higher-dimensional OAM\nHilbert space enhances the information capacity of this approach, while the\npresence of the off-diagonal correlations allows for recognition of specific\nspatial signatures present in the object. In particular, this allows the\ndetection of discrete rotational symmetries and the efficient evaluation of\nmultiple azimuthal Fourier coefficients using fewer resources than in\nconventional pixel-by-pixel imaging.

In low mass galaxies with M<10^9Msun, a large amount\nof gas is evacuated by photo-evaporation as previous studies have shown, which\nresults in the suppression of star formation. Surprisingly, star formation in\nmassive halos is also strongly suppressed despite the fact that these halos\nhardly lose any gas by photo-evaporation. The suppression of star formation in\nmassive halos is mainly caused by following two factors; (i) small scale clumpy\nstructures in the galaxies are smoothened by the internal feedback, (ii)\nalthough the dense gas in the galaxies is mostly neutral, the H_2 formation and\ncooling processes are disturbed by mild photo-heating.

We start by\ndefining non-Euclidean analogues of the Euclidean Funk weak metric and we give\nthree distinct representations of it in each of the non-Euclidean cases, which\nparallel the known situation for the Euclidean case. As a consequence, all of\nthese metrics are shown to be Finslerian, and the associated norms of the\nFinsler metrics are described. The theory is developed by using a set of\nclassical trigonometric identities on the sphere $S^n$ and the hyperbolic space\n$\\mathbb{H}^n$ and the definition of a cross ratio on the non-Euclidean spaces\nof constant curvature. This in turn leads to the concept of projectivity\ninvariance in these spaces. We then study the geodesics of the Funk and Hilbert\nmetrics.

We\nselected in the Bologna Complete Sample a sub sample of Compact sources, naming\nit the C BCS sample. We collected new and literature sub-arcsecond resolution\nmulti-frequency VLA images and optical data. We compared total and nuclear\nradio power with optical emission line measurements. The [OIII] luminosity -\n408 MHz total power relation found in High and Low excitation galaxies, as well\nas in young (CSS) sources, holds also for the C BCSs. However, C BCSs present\nhigher [OIII] luminosity than expected at a given total radio power, and they\nshow the same correlation of Core Radio Galaxies, but with a higher radio\npower. C BCSs appear to be the high power tail of Core Radio Galaxies. For most\nof the C BCSs, the morphology seems to be strongly dependent to the presence of\ndense environments (e.g. cluster or HI-rich galaxies) and to a low age or\nrestarted radio activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 10:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We show\nthat a maximally entangled state and its orthogonal complement, no matter how\nmany copies are supplied, can not be distinguished by PPT POVMs, even\nunambiguously. This result is much stronger than the previous known ones\n\\cite{DUAN06,BAN11}. (3). We study the entanglement cost of distinguishing\nquantum states. It is proved that $\\sqrt{2/3}\\ket{00}+\\sqrt{1/3}\\ket{11}$ is\nsufficient and necessary for distinguishing three Bell states by PPT POVMs. An\nupper bound of entanglement cost of distinguishing a $d\\otimes d$ pure state\nand its orthogonal complement is obtained for separable operations. Based on\nthis bound, we are able to construct two orthogonal quantum states which cannot\nbe distinguished unambiguously by separable POVMs, but finite copies would make\nthem perfectly distinguishable by LOCC. We further observe that a two-qubit\nmaximally entangled state is always enough for distinguishing a $d\\otimes d$\npure state and its orthogonal complement by PPT POVMs, no matter the value of\n$d$. In sharp contrast, an entangled state with Schmidt number at least $d$ is\nalways needed for distinguishing such two states by separable POVMs. As an\napplication, we show that the entanglement cost of distinguishing a $d\\otimes\nd$ maximally entangled state and its orthogonal complement must be a maximally\nentangled state for $d=2$,which implies that teleportation is optimal; and in\ngeneral, it could be chosen as $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\log d}{d})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 12:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 16:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-02"}

We propose a method of edge bundling drawing each edge\nof a bundle separately as in metro-maps and call our method ordered bundles. To\nproduce aesthetically looking edge routes it minimizes a cost function on the\nedges. The cost function depends on the ink, required to draw the edges, the\nedge lengths, widths and separations. The cost also penalizes for too many\nedges passing through narrow channels by using the constrained Delaunay\ntriangulation. The method avoids unnecessary edge-node and edge-edge crossings.\nTo draw edges with the minimal number of crossings and separately within the\nsame bundle we develop an efficient algorithm solving a variant of the\nmetro-line crossing minimization problem. In general, the method creates clear\nand smooth edge routes giving an overview of the global graph structure, while\nstill drawing each edge separately and thus enabling local analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 12:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-20"}

Increased allelic variation\nand modification of the transcriptional network are the two recognized forces\ncurrently deemed to be responsible for the phenotypic properties seen in\nhybrids. However, since the majority of the biological functions in a cell are\ncarried out by protein complexes, inter-specific protein assemblies therefore\nrepresent another important source of natural variation upon which evolutionary\nforces can act. Here we studied the composition of six protein complexes in two\ndifferent Saccharomyces \"sensu strictu\" hybrids, to understand whether chimeric\ninteractions can be freely formed in the cell in spite of species-specific\nco-evolutionary forces, and whether the different types of complexes cause a\nchange in hybrid fitness. The protein assemblies were isolated from the hybrids\nvia affinity chromatography and identified via mass spectrometry. We found\nevidence of spontaneous chimericity for four of the six protein assemblies\ntested and we showed that different types of complexes can cause a variety of\nphenotypes in selected environments. In the case of TRP2/TRP3 complex, the\neffect of such chimeric formation resulted in the fitness advantage of the\nhybrid in an environment lacking tryptophan, while only one type of parental\ncombination of the MBF complex could confer viability to the hybrid under\nrespiratory conditions. This study provides empirical evidence that chimeric\nprotein complexes can freely assemble in cells and reveals a new mechanism to\ngenerate phenotypic novelty and plasticity in hybrids to complement the genomic\ninnovation resulting from gene duplication. The ability to exchange orthologous\nmembers has also important implications for the adaptation and subsequent\ngenome evolution of the hybrids in terms of pattern of gene loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 14:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-24"}

This mechanism might apply to many charge ordered\nsystems, in particular, we study the case of BaBiO3(001). In bulk, this\nmaterial is a prototype of a \"forbidden valence\" compound in which the formal\n\"metallic\" Bi4+ state is skipped exhibiting a charge disproportionated Bi3+ -\nBi5+ ordered structure. At room temperature, this charge disproportionation\ntogether with the breathing distortions gives rise to a Peierls semiconductor\nwith monoclinic crystal structure.

Spectral analysis\nof the flows demonstrates the formation of dual cascade with energy and\nenstrophy intervals although the corresponding spectral fluxes of energy and\nenstrophy are not uniform in these intervals.

Methods for finding physical\nparameterization schemes that preserve conservation laws of systems of\ndifferential equations are introduced. These methods rest on the possibility to\nregard the problem of finding conservative parameterization schemes as a\nconservation law classification problem for classes of differential equations.\nThe relevant classification problems can be solved using the direct or inverse\nclassification procedures. In the direct approach, one starts with a general\nfunctional form of the parameterization scheme. Specific forms are then found\nso that corresponding closed equations admit conservation laws. In the inverse\napproach, one seeks parameterization schemes that preserve one or more\npre-selected conservation laws of the initial model. The physical\ninterpretation of both classification approaches is discussed. Special\nattention is paid to the problem of finding parameterization schemes that\npreserve both conservation laws and symmetries. All methods are illustrated by\nfinding conservative and conservative invariant parameterization schemes for\nsystems of one-dimensional shallow-water equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 15:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Assuming that the stalled shock wave is relaunched by neutrino\nheating and employing the so-called light bulb approximation, we induce shock\nrevival by raising the neutrino luminosity by hand up to the critical value,\nwhich is also de- termined by dynamical simulations. A 15M_{sun} progenitor\nmodel is employed. We incorporate nuclear network calculations with a\nconsistent equation of state in the simulations to account for the energy\nrelease by nuclear reactions and their feedback to hydrodynamics. Varying the\nshock-relaunch time rather arbitrarily, we investigate the ensuing long-term\nevolutions systematically, paying particular attention to the explosion energy\nand nucleosynthetic yields as a function of this relaunch time, or equivalently\nthe accretion rate at shock revival. We study in detail how the diagnostic\nexplosion energy approaches the asymptotic value and which physical processes\ncontribute to the explosion energy in what proportions as well as their\ndependence on the relaunch time and the dimension of dynamics. We find that the\ncontribution of nuclear reactions to the explosion energy is comparable to or\ngreater than that of neutrino heating. In particular, recombinations are\ndominant over burnings in the contributions of nuclear reactions. Interestingly\n1D models studied in this paper cannot produce the appropriate explosion energy\nand nickel mass simultaneously, overproducing nickels, whereas this problem is\nresolved in 2D models if the shock is relaunched at 300-400ms after bounce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 03:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 05:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The\nprobability that an object is associated with a source from the other catalog,\nor that it has no counterpart, is derived under two exclusive assumptions:\nfirst, the classical case of several-to-one associations, and then the more\nrealistic but more difficult problem of one-to-one associations.\n  In either case, the likelihood of observing the objects in the two catalogs\nat their effective positions is computed and a maximum likelihood estimator of\nthe fraction of sources with a counterpart -- a quantity needed to compute the\nprobabilities of association -- is built. When the positional uncertainty in\none or both catalogs is unknown, this method may be used to estimate its\ntypical value and even to study its dependence on the size of objects. It may\nalso be applied when the true centers of a source and of its counterpart at\nanother wavelength do not coincide.\n  To compute the likelihood and association probabilities under the different\nassumptions, we developed a Fortran 95 code called \"Aspects\" ([asp{\\epsilon}],\n\"ASsociation PositionnellE/ProbabilistE de CaTalogues de Sources\" in French);\nits source files are made freely available. To test Aspects, all-sky mock\ncatalogs containing up to 10^5 objects were created, forcing either\nseveral-to-one or one-to-one associations. The analysis of these simulations\nconfirms that, in both cases, the assumption with the highest likelihood is the\nright one and that estimators of unknown parameters built for the appropriate\nassociation model are reliable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 08:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 16:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 16:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-23"}
