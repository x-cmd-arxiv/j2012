The finite-time dynamics of this system\ndepends on the relative frequencies of (chaotic) particle-particle collisions\nversus (integrable) particle-boundary collisions, and investigating these\ndynamics is computationally intensive because of the long time scales involved.\nTo help improve understanding of such two-particle dynamics, we compare the\nresults of diagnostics used to measure chaotic dynamics for a two-particle\ncircular billiard with those computed for two types of one-particle circular\nbilliards in which a confined particle undergoes random perturbations.\nImportantly, such one-particle approximations are much less computationally\ndemanding than the original two-particle system, and we expect them to yield\nreasonable estimates of the extent of chaotic behavior in the two-particle\nsystem when the sizes of confined particles are small.

Most treatments and analyses of post-photospheric\noptical spectra of supernovae assume that forbidden-line emission comprises\nmost if not all spectral features. However, evidence exists which suggests that\nsome spectra exhibit line profiles formed via optically thick\nresonance-scattering even months or years after the supernova explosion. To\nexplore this possibility we present a geometrical approach to supernova\nspectrum formation based on the \"Elementary Supernova\" model, wherein we\ninvestigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically thick\nlines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emitting\nnon-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided by\ndecaying 56Co formed during the explosion. We develop the mathematical\nframework necessary for solving the radiative transfer equation under these\nconditions, and calculate spectra for both isolated and blended lines. Our\ncomparisons with analogous results from the Elementary Supernova code SYNOW\nreveal several marked differences in line formation. Most notably, resonance\nlines in these conditions form P Cygni-like profiles, but the emission peaks\nand absorption troughs shift redward and blueward, respectively, from the\nline's rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite the spherically\nsymmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta.

As with previous observations, the blob has a chaotic velocity structure,\nmuch of which breaks up into multiple components. Our spectroscopy shows,\nhowever, that some of these multiple components are extremely narrow: they have\nvelocity widths of less than 100 km/s.\n  Combining these new data with previous observations, we argue that this\nLyman-alpha blob resides in a dark-matter halo of around 10^13 solar masses. At\nthe centre of this halo are two compact red massive galaxies. They are\nsurrounded by hot gas, probably a super-wind from merger-induced nuclear\nstarbursts. This hot gas has shut down star formation in the non-nuclear region\nof these galaxies, leading to their red-and-dead colours.\n  A filament or lump of infalling cold gas is colliding with the hot gas phase\nand being shocked to high temperatures, while still around 30kpc from the red\ngalaxies. The shock region is self-absorbed in Lyman-alpha but produces C IV\nemission.\n  Further out still, the cold gas in a number of sub-halos is being lit up,\nmost likely by a combination of tidally triggered star formation, bow-shocks as\nthey plough through the hot halo medium, resonant scattering of Lyman-alpha\nfrom the filament collision, and tidal stripping of gas which enhances the\nLyman-alpha escape fraction. The observed Lyman-alpha emission from the Blob is\ndominated by the sum of the emission from these sub-halos.\n  On statistical grounds, we argue that Lyman-alpha blobs are not greatly\nelongated in shape, and that most are not powered by ionisation or scattering\nfrom a central active galactic nucleus or starburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 01:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

From the peculiar temperature-dependence of the\ncarrier dynamics in the intermediate temperature region between the\nsuperconducting and spin density wave phase transitions, we infer a temperature\nscale where the charge gap associated with the spin ordered phase is maximum\nand closes on either side while approaching the two phase transition\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 04:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 13:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

We derive this formula for\nthese black holes and also demonstrate that such a formula can be expressed in\nthe form of a dimension independent identity $K_{\\chi^{\\mu}}=2ST$ (where the\nl.h.s is the Komar conserved charge corresponding to the null Killing vector\n$\\chi^{\\mu}$ and in the r.h.s $S, T$ are the semi-classical entropy and\ntemperature of a black hole) defined at the black hole event horizon. We\nhighlight the role of exact differentials in computations involving black hole\nthermodynamics. Some results like the first law of black hole thermodynamics\nand semi-classical entropy are obtained without using the laws of black hole\nmechanics as usually done. The blackbody (Hawking) radiation spectrum for\nhigher dimensional black holes is computed by using a density matrix technique\nof tunneling mechanism by considering both event and cosmological horizons. We\nalso provide the modifications to the semi-classical Hawking temperature and\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy due to various effects.

Though the mean sea ice area has decreased\nsteadily in the period of satellite observations, a dramatic transition in the\ndynamics was initiated with the record low September ice area in 2007. The\nchange is much more pronounced in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle than in\nthe annual mean ice area. The shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly\nconstant for the whole observational record despite the general decline.

Thus the dramatic climate change in\narctic ice area is seen in the amplitude of the cycle and to a lesser extend\nthe annual mean and the summer ice extend. The reason why the climate change is\nmost pronounced in the amplitude is related to the rapid reduction in perennial\nice and thus a thinning of the ice.

We prove\nthat there are no embedded examples in the family when H<0 and we also prove\nthat for every integer m>2 there is a properly immersed example in this family\nthat contains a great circle and is invariant under the ciclic group Z_m. We\nwill say that these examples contain the axis of symmetry. Finally we show that\nevery non-isoparametric surface \\Sigma_{H,C} is either properly immersed\ninvariant under the ciclic group Z_m for some integer m>1 or it is dense in the\nregion bounded by two isoparametric tori if the surface \\Sigma_{H,C} does not\ncontain the axis of symmetry or it is dense in the region bounded by a totally\numbilical surface if the surface \\Sigma_{H,C} contains the axis of symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 13:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

Instead of observing a subset of the real-valued\nentries of a matrix M, we obtain a small number of binary (1-bit) measurements\ngenerated according to a probability distribution determined by the real-valued\nentries of M. The central question we ask is whether or not it is possible to\nobtain an accurate estimate of M from this data. In general this would seem\nimpossible, but we show that the maximum likelihood estimate under a suitable\nconstraint returns an accurate estimate of M when ||M||_{\\infty} <= \\alpha, and\nrank(M) <= r. If the log-likelihood is a concave function (e.g., the logistic\nor probit observation models), then we can obtain this maximum likelihood\nestimate by optimizing a convex program.

However, relying\nsolely on the crowd is often impractical even for data sets with thousands of\nitems, due to time and cost constraints of acquiring human input (which cost\npennies and minutes per label). In this paper, we propose algorithms for\nintegrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases, with the goal of\nallowing crowd-sourcing applications to scale, i.e., to handle larger datasets\nat lower costs. The key observation is that, in many of the above tasks, humans\nand machine learning algorithms can be complementary, as humans are often more\naccurate but slow and expensive, while algorithms are usually less accurate,\nbut faster and cheaper.\n  Based on this observation, we present two new active learning algorithms to\ncombine humans and algorithms together in a crowd-sourced database. Our\nalgorithms are based on the theory of non-parametric bootstrap, which makes our\nresults applicable to a broad class of machine learning models. Our results, on\nthree real-life datasets collected with Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and on 15\nwell-known UCI data sets, show that our methods on average ask humans to label\none to two orders of magnitude fewer items to achieve the same accuracy as a\nbaseline that labels random images, and two to eight times fewer questions than\nprevious active learning schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 15:21:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 15:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 18:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2014 08:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

We are trying an effort to find an equation of state of\ncondensed quark-cluster matter in a phenomenological way.

We present two accelerating dark energy (DE)\nmodels with an anisotropic fluid in Bianchi type-$VI_{0}$ space-time. To\nprevail the deterministic solution we choose the scale factor $a(t) =\n\\sqrt{t^{n}e^{t}}$, which yields a time-dependent deceleration parameter (DP),\nrepresenting a class of models which generate a transition of the universe from\nthe early decelerating phase to the recent accelerating phase. Under the\nsuitable condition, the anisotropic models approach to isotropic scenario. The\nEoS for dark energy $\\omega$ is found to be time-dependent and its existing\nrange for derived models is in good agreement with the recent observations of\nSNe Ia data (Knop et al. 2003), SNe Ia data with CMBR anisotropy and galaxy\nclustering statistics (Tegmark et al. 2004) and latest combination of\ncosmological datasets coming from CMB anisotropies, luminosity distances of\nhigh redshift type Ia supernovae and galaxy clustering (Hinshaw et al. 2009;\nKomatsu et al. 2009). For different values of $n$, we can generate a class of\nphysically viable DE models.The cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is found to be\na positive decreasing function of time and it approaches to a small positive\nvalue at late time (i.e. the present epoch) which is corroborated by results\nfrom recent type Ia supernovae observations. We also observe that our solutions\nare stable. The physical and geometric aspects of both the models are also\ndiscussed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 04:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
