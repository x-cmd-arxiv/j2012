We compare space observations of\nLyman lines with ground-based observations of Balmer lines for quiescent solar\nprominences of comparable brightness defined by their H-beta emission. The\neffective number densities of hydrogen atoms emitting from the same upper level\nu deduced from the corresponding emerging Lyman and Balmer line emissions show\nlarge differences that diminish with increasing level number and converge at\nthe highest level numbers. Hydrogen atoms excited in u=5 contribute 250 times\nless, and those in u=8 still contribute 65 times less to the Lyman than to the\ncorresponding Balmer emission, supporting the idea of distinct spatial origin\nof the emissions of both series. This is also indicated by the line widths. The\nhigh optical thickness of all Lyman members allows the brightness temperature\nT_b to be estimated from the spectral radiance at line center, where T_b is\nfound to be largely independent of the upper level number, in contrast to the\n(known) behavior of the Balmer lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 16:07:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 09:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

We show that the consideration of one-particle\nreducible six-point (as well as higher order) vertices is crucially important\nfor the diagrammatic consistency of this approach. In particular, the relation\nbetween the dual and lattice self-energy, derived in the dual fermion approach,\nimplicitly accounts for the effect of the diagrams, containing 6-point and\nhigher order local one-particle reducible vertices, and should be applied with\ncaution, if these vertices are neglected.

This seemingly simple problem is made challenging by the\nhigh dimensionality and high degree of correlation in the parameter spaces that\ndescribe the signals, and by the complexity of the astrophysical models, which\ncan also depend on a large number of parameters, some of which might not be\ndirectly constrained by the observations.

We present a method for including gas extinction of\ncosmic-ray-generated UV photons in chemical models of the midplane of\nprotoplanetary disks, focusing on its implications on ice formation and\nchemical evolution. Aims. Our goal is to improve on chemical models by treating\ncosmic rays, the main source of ionization in the midplane of the disk, in a\nway that is consistent with current knowledge of the gas and grain environment\npresent in those regions. We trace the effects of cosmic rays by identifying\nthe main chemical reaction channels and also the main contributors to the gas\nopacity to cosmic-ray-induced UV photons. This information is crucial in\nimplementing gas opacities for cosmic-ray-induced reactions in full 2D\nprotoplanetary disk models. Methods. We considered time-dependent chemical\nmodels within the range 1-10 AU in the midplane of a T Tauri disk. The\nextinction of cosmic-ray-induced UV photons by gaseous species was included in\nthe calculation of photorates at each timestep. We integrated the ionization\nand dissociation cross sections of all atoms/molecules over the\ncosmic-ray-induced UV emission spectrum of H_2. By analyzing the relative\ncontribution of each gas phase species over time, we were able to identify the\nmain contributors to the gas opacity in the midplane of protoplanetary disks.\nResults. At 1 AU the gas opacity contributes up to 28.2% of the total opacity,\nincluding the dust contribution. At 3-5 AU the gas contribution is 14.5% of the\ntotal opacity, and at 7-8 AU it reaches a value of 12.2%. As expected, at 10-15\nAU freeze-out of species causes the gas contribution to the total opacity to be\nvery low (6%). The main contributors to the gas opacity are CO, CO_2, S, SiO,\nand O_2. OH also contributes to the gas opacity, but only at 10-15 AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 17:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Smith (1994, 2007) showed that an\nassociation scheme X=(Q,\\Gamma) of order d:=|Q| is Schurian iff X is extensible\nto height (d-2). In this work, we formalize the maximal height t_max(X) of an\nassociation scheme X as the largest positive integer such that X is extensible\nto height t (we also include the possibility t_max(X)=\\infty, which is\nequivalent to t_max(X)\\ge (d-2)).

One such case was SN 2009ip, which was recognized to\nbe a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption. This source had a massive hot\nprogenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence of\npre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2nd\noutburst in 2010. This same source rebrightened again in 2012, and early\nspectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting another\nLBV-like eruption. We present new photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2009ip,\nindicating that it has transitioned into a true SN. The most striking discovery\nin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer\nlines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and\nLBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are\ntypical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a\nnonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed\nfainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the\nsource quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days. The broad\nlines mostly disappeared, and the spectrum began to resemble the early\noptically thick phases of SNe IIn. Two weeks later the source leveled off near\n-18 mag, after which broad emission lines again developed in the spectrum as\nthe source faded. We conclude that the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip was the\nresult of a true core-collapse SN IIn that occured when the progenitor star was\nin an LBV-like outburst phase, and where the SN was initially faint and then\nrapidly brightened due to interaction with circumstellar material (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 18:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 19:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 19:39:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 02:56:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 19:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

One possibility is that primordial magnetic\nfields generated in the early Universe provide seeds that grow through\ncompression and turbulence during structure formation. A cosmological magnetic\nfield present prior to recombination would produce substantial matter\nclustering at intermediate/small scales, on top of the standard inflationary\npower spectrum. In this work we study the effect of this alteration on one\nparticular cosmological observable, cosmic shear. We adopt the semi-analytic\nhalo model in order to describe the non-linear clustering of matter, and feed\nit with the altered mass variance induced by primordial magnetic fields. We\nfind that the convergence power spectrum is, as expected, substantially\nenhanced at intermediate/small angular scales, with the exact amplitude of the\nenhancement depending on the magnitude and power-law index of the magnetic\nfield power spectrum. We use the predicted statistical errors for a future\nwide-field cosmic shear survey, on the model of the ESA Cosmic Vision mission\n\\emph{Euclid}, in order to forecast constraints on the amplitude of primordial\nmagnetic fields as a function of the spectral index. We find that the amplitude\nwill be constrained at the level of $\\sim 0.1$ nG for $n_B\\sim -3$, and at the\nlevel of $\\sim 10^{-7}$ nG for $n_B\\sim 3$.

This paper aims at illustrating some of the\nnew challenges that arise in the design of communication networks in which the\nsignals exchanged by the nodes carry both information and energy. To this end,\na baseline two-way communication system is considered in which two nodes\ncommunicate in an interactive fashion. In the system, a node can either send an\n\"on\" symbol (or \"1\"), which costs one unit of energy, or an \"off\" signal (or\n\"0\"), which does not require any energy expenditure. Upon reception of a \"1\"\nsignal, the recipient node \"harvests\", with some probability, the energy\ncontained in the signal and stores it for future communication tasks. Inner and\nouter bounds on the achievable rates are derived. Numerical results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed strategies and illustrate some key design\ninsights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 20:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In response to the crisis, drastic actions have been\ntaken, including the halving of Greek debt. Policy makers acted because\ninterest rates for sovereign debt increased dramatically. High interest rates\nimply that default is likely due to economic conditions. High interest rates\nalso increase the cost of borrowing and thus cause default to be likely. If\nthere is a departure from equilibrium, increasing interest rates may contribute\nto---rather than be caused by---default risk. Here we build a quantitative\nequilibrium model of sovereign default risk that, for the first time, is able\nto determine if markets are consistently set by economic conditions. We show\nthat over the period 2001-2012, the annually-averaged long-term interest rates\nof Greek debt are quantitatively related to the ratio of debt to GDP. The\nrelationship shows that the market consistently expects default to occur if the\nGreek debt reaches twice the GDP. Our analysis does not preclude\nnon-equilibrium increases in interest rates over shorter timeframes. We find\nevidence of such non-equilibrium fluctuations in a separate analysis. According\nto the equilibrium model, the date by which a half-default must occur is March\n2013, almost one year after the actual debt write-down. Any acceleration of\ndefault by non-equilibrium fluctuations is significant for national and\ninternational interventions. The need for austerity or bailout costs would be\nreduced if market regulations were implemented to increase market stability to\nprevent short term interest rate increases. We similarly evaluate the timing of\nprojected defaults without interventions for Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy\nto be March 2013, April 2014, May 2014, and July 2016, respectively. All\ndefaults are mitigated by planned interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 20:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-01"}

In this work we examine topological\ninsulators with bulk s-wave superconductivity in the presence of a\nvortex-lattice generated by a perpendicular magnetic field.

Further, we\ndemonstrate that the previously predicted vortex phase transition survives\nbeyond the semi-classical limit. At chemical potential values smaller than the\ncritical chemical potential, the vortex lattice modes hybridize within the top\nand bottom surfaces giving rise to a dispersive low-energy mid-gap band. As the\nchemical potential is increased, the Majorana states become more localized\nwithin a single surface but spread into the bulk toward the opposite surface.\nEventually, when the chemical potential is sufficiently high in the bulk bands,\nthe Majorana modes can tunnel between surfaces and eventually a critical point\nis reached at which modes on opposite surfaces can freely tunnel and annihilate\nleading to the topological phase transition previously studied in the work of\nHosur et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 20:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Here we show\nthe effect of speculators on food prices using a validated quantitative model\nthat accurately describes historical food prices. During the last six years,\nhigh and fluctuating food prices have lead to widespread hunger and social\nunrest. While a relative dip in food prices occurred during the spring of 2012,\na massive drought in the American Midwest in June and July threatens to trigger\nanother crisis. In a previous paper, we constructed a model that quantitatively\nagreed with food prices and demonstrated that, while the behavior could not be\nexplained by supply and demand economics, it could be parsimoniously and\naccurately described by a model which included both the conversion of corn into\nethanol and speculator trend following.

Here we provide a second\nupdate, evaluating the effects of the current drought on global food prices. We\nfind that the drought may trigger the expected third food price bubble to occur\nsooner, before new limits to speculation are scheduled to take effect.

The (ordered) random polyhedron is the Fraisse limit of the class\nof finite ordered polyhedra; we prove that its group of automorphisms is\nextremely amenable. Finally, we present a countably infinite family of\ntopological Ramsey subspaces; each one determines a class of finite ordered\nstructures which turns out to be a Ramsey class. One of these subspaces is\nEllentuck's space; another one is associated to the class of finite ordered\ngraphs whose Fraisse limit is the random graph. The Fraisse limits of these\nclasses are not pairwise isomorphic as countable structures and none of them is\nisomorphic to the random polyhedron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 04:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 00:26:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 22:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 22:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

In RRF the features are evaluated on a\npart of the training data at each tree node. We derive an upper bound for the\nnumber of distinct Gini information gain values in a node, and show that many\nfeatures can share the same information gain at a node with a small number of\ninstances and a large number of features. Therefore, in a node with a small\nnumber of instances, RRF is likely to select a feature not strongly relevant.\nHere an enhanced RRF, referred to as the guided RRF (GRRF), is proposed. In\nGRRF, the importance scores from an ordinary random forest (RF) are used to\nguide the feature selection process in RRF. Experiments on 10 gene data sets\nshow that the accuracy performance of GRRF is, in general, more robust than RRF\nwhen their parameters change. GRRF is computationally efficient, can select\ncompact feature subsets, and has competitive accuracy performance, compared to\nRRF, varSelRF and LASSO logistic regression (with evaluations from an RF\nclassifier). Also, RF applied to the features selected by RRF with the minimal\nregularization outperforms RF applied to all the features for most of the data\nsets considered here. Therefore, if accuracy is considered more important than\nthe size of the feature subset, RRF with the minimal regularization may be\nconsidered. We use the accuracy performance of RF, a strong classifier, to\nevaluate feature selection methods, and illustrate that weak classifiers are\nless capable of capturing the information contained in a feature subset.

I tried many things, and more failed than succeeded, but\nin the end I found two approaches that appear to work based on tests done using\nthe open data sets. One approach works directly with the time domain data, and\nthe other works with a specially constructed Fourier transform of the data. The\nraw data was run through TEMPO2 to produce reduced timing residuals for the\nanalysis. Standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques were used to produce\nsamples from the posterior distribution function for the model parameters. The\nmodel parameters include the gravitational wave amplitude and spectral slope,\nand the white noise amplitude for each pulsar in the array. While red timing\nnoise was only included in Dataset 3, I found that it was necessary to include\neffective red noise in all the analyses to account for some of the spurious\neffects introduced by the TEMPO2 timing fit. This added an additional amplitude\nand slope parameter for each pulsar, so my overall model for the 36 pulsars\nresiduals has 110 parameters. As an alternative to using an effective red noise\nmodel, I also tried to simultaneously re-fit the timing model model while\nlooking for the gravitational wave signal, but for reasons that are not yet\nclear, this approach was not very successful. I comment briefly on ways in\nwhich the algorithms could be improved.

Each\nobservation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model for\nthe continuum emission. Prompted by the correlation between the UV and soft\nX-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft X-ray\nexcess. The UV to X-rays/gamma-rays emission of Mrk 509 can be well fitted by\nthese components. The presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum points\nto the existence of a hot (kT~100 keV), optically-thin (tau~0.5) corona\nproducing the primary continuum. On the contrary, the soft X-ray component\nrequires a warm (kT~1 keV), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. Estimates of the\namplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the\n\"theoretical\" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. An\ninteresting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, a\npossible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft X-ray\nexcess seen in AGNs. The temperature (~ 3 eV) and flux of the soft-photon field\nentering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion disk\ndown to a transition radius $R_{tr}$ of 10-20 $R_g$. This plasma could be the\nwarm upper layer of the accretion disk. On the contrary the hot corona has a\nmore photon-starved geometry. The high temperature ($\\sim$ 100 eV) of the\nsoft-photon field entering and cooling it favors a localization of the hot\ncorona in the inner flow. This soft-photon field could be part of the\ncomptonised emission produced by the warm plasma. In this framework, the change\nin the geometry (i.e. $R_{tr}$) could explain most of the observed flux and\nspectral variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 07:39:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 14:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In addition, it displays an odd\nbehaviour due to the scale invariance property, which does not seem desirable\nin this context. Such weaknesses definitely prove that the (best) gain-loss is\na poor performance measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 07:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 11:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Moreover, we derive and\nuse a truncated version of this fractal tube formula in order to show that Lp\nis not Minkowski measurable and obtain an explicit expression for its average\nMinkowski content. The general theory is illustrated by two simple examples,\nthe 3-adic Cantor string and the 2-adic Fibonacci strings, which are\nnonarchimedean analogs (introduced in [17, 18]) of the real Cantor and\nFibonacci strings studied in [28].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 07:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 09:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

Starting point is the Smoluchowski\nequation for $N$ bath and a single probe particle. The probe performs Brownian\nmotion under the influence of a strong constant and uniform external force\n$\\Fex$. It is immersed in a dense homogeneous bath of (different) particles\nalso performing Brownian motion. Fluid and glass states are considered; solvent\nflow effects are neglected. Based on a formally exact generalized Green-Kubo\nrelation, mode coupling approximations are performed and an integration through\ntransients approach applied. A first-principles theory for the nonlinear\nvelocity-force relations of the probe particle in a dense fluid and for the\n(de-) localized probe in a glass is obtained.\n  It extends the mode coupling theory of the glass transition to strongly\nforced tracer motion and describes active microrheology experiments. A force\nthreshold is identified which needs to be overcome to pull the probe particle\nfree in a glass. For the model of hard sphere particles, the microscopic\nequations for the threshold force and the probability density of the localized\nprobe are solved numerically.

Many of these models, including those used in Kendziorski's et\nal. [Stat. Med.

A large body of currently adopted\nmethods, either parametrically or nonparametrically, predominantly focus on\npairwise single marker interaction analysis.

The gravitational influence of this massive hot\nJupiter (M=6 M_jup) has locked the star-planet system, making the star rotate\nin P~3.3 days, similar to the orbital period of the planet. From the well\nestablished correlation between stellar rotation and radio luminosity, it is\nconceivable that the tau Bootis system emits strong radio emission at\nsignificantly higher frequencies than currently probed, which we aimed to\ninvestigate with this work.\n  Methods: We observed tau Bootis with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope\n(WSRT) at a frequency of 1.7 GHz. for 12 hours in spectral line mode, reaching\na noise level of 42 microJy/beam at the position of the target.\n  Results: No 18cm radio emission is detected from tau Bootis, resulting in a 3\nsigma upper limit of 0.13 mJy, corresponding to a 18cm radio luminosity of\n<3.7e13 erg/s/Hz. We observe tau Bootis to be two orders of magnitude fainter\nthan expected from the stellar relation between radio luminosity and rotation\nvelocity.\n  Conclusions: This implies that either the tau Bootis system is underluminous\nin the radio compared to similar fast-rotating stars, or that we happened to\nobserve the target during a low state of radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 13:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Custom texturing enhances the quality of lubrication,\nreduces friction, and allows the use of lubricants of lower viscosity. To date,\na standardized procedure to generate deterministic texture constructs is\nvirtually non-existent. Many engineers, therefore, study natural species to\nexplore surface construction and to probe the role surface topography assumes\nin friction control. Snakes offer rich examples of surfaces where topological\nfeatures allow the optimization and control of frictional behavior. In this\npaper, we investigate the frictional behavior of a constrictor type reptile,\nPython regius. The study employed a specially designed tribo-acoustic probe\ncapable of measuring the coefficient of friction and detecting the acoustical\nbehavior of the skin in vivo. The results confirm the anisotropy of the\nfrictional response of snakeskin. The coefficient of friction depends on the\ndirection of sliding: the value in forward motion is lower than that in the\nconverse direction. Detailed analysis of the surface metrological feature\nreveal that tuning frictional response in snakes originates from the\nhierarchical nature of surface topology combined to the profile asymmetry of\nsurface micro-features, and the variation of the curvature of the contacting\nscales at different body regions. Such a combination affords the reptile the\nability to optimize the frictional response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 14:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-01"}

We\nemployed the dispersion relations of kink waves derived from the linearised\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations. We assumed real wave numbers and complex angular\nwave frequencies, namely complex wave phase velocities. The dispersion\nrelations were solved numerically at fixed input parameters and several mass\nflow velocities. We show that the stability of the waves depends upon four\nparameters, the density contrast between the flux tube and its environment, the\nratio of the background magnetic fields in the two media, the twist of the\nmagnetic field lines inside the tube, and the value of the Alfven-Mach number\n(the ratio of the jet velocity to Alfv\\'en speed inside the flux tube). At\ncertain densities and magnetic field twists, an instability of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz type of kink (m = 1) mode can arise if the Alfven-Mach number\nexceeds a critical value.

Network coding over a large finite field\nsize has been shown to be a theoretically efficient solution to the index\ncoding problem. However the high computational complexity of packet encoding\nand decoding over a large finite field size, and its subsequent penalty on\nencoding and decoding throughput and higher energy cost makes it unsuitable for\npractical implementation in processor and energy constraint devices like mobile\nphones and wireless sensors. While network coding over GF(2) can alleviate\nthese concerns, it comes at a tradeoff cost of degrading throughput\nperformance. To address this tradeoff, we propose a throughput optimal\ntriangular network coding scheme over GF(2). We show that such a coding scheme\ncan supply unlimited number of innovative packets and the decoding involves the\nsimple back substitution. Such a coding scheme provides an efficient solution\nto the index coding problem and its lower computation and energy cost makes it\nsuitable for practical implementation on devices with limited processing and\nenergy capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 14:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-01"}

This new technique is based on the practical variants of the two\nconstructive versions of the Regularity Lemma, a very useful tool in graph\ntheory. The lemma claims that every graph can be partitioned into pseudo-random\ngraphs. While the Regularity Lemma has become very important in proving\ntheoretical results, it has no direct practical applications so far. An\nimportant reason for this lack of practical applications is that the graph\nunder consideration has to be astronomically large. This requirement makes its\napplication restrictive in practice where graphs typically are much smaller. In\nthis paper we propose modifications of the constructive versions of the\nRegularity Lemma that work for smaller graphs as well. We call this the\nPractical Regularity partitioning algorithm. The partition obtained by this is\nused to build the reduced graph which can be viewed as a compressed\nrepresentation of the original graph. Then we apply a pairwise clustering\nmethod such as spectral clustering on this reduced graph to get a clustering of\nthe original graph that we call Regularity Clustering. We present results of\nusing Regularity Clustering on a number of benchmark datasets and compare them\nwith standard clustering techniques, such as $k$-means and spectral clustering.\nThese empirical results are very encouraging. Thus in this paper we report an\nattempt to harness the power of the Regularity Lemma for real-world\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 15:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-01"}

The\ninteraction between the cold dark matter (dust) and the dark energy has been\nassumed to be non-gravitational in nature. Exact analytic cosmological\nsolutions are obtained both for constant and variable equation of state for\ndark energy. It is found that, for very small value of the coupling parameter\n(in the interaction term), the model asymptotically extends up to $\\Lambda$CDM,\nwhile the model can enter into the phantom domain asymptotically, if the\ncoupling parameter is not so small. Both the solutions are then analyzed with\n194 Supernovae Type Ia data. The best fit parameters are shown with 1$\\sigma$\nand 2$\\sigma$ confidence intervals. Finally, we have discussed the cosmographic\nparameters for both the cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 05:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 13:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 12:14:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 06:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 13:34:04 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 07:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-31"}

Since the Standard Model does not\ninvolve massive neutrinos, baryon or lepton number violations and the cold dark\nmatter particle, there are great expectations in search for physics beyond the\nStandard Model. The LHC experiments reported no new physics, except for the\nappearance of the 125 GeV heavy resonance. If this resonance turns out to be a\nHiggs boson, we shall be faced with the paradox that the Standard Model, as a\ntheoretically and experimentally incomplete and defective theory, is confirmed.\nIf, on the other hand, this resonance is a scalar or pseudoscalar meson - a\nmixture of a (pseudo)scalar glueball and toponium, one has to study alternative\nsymmetry-breaking mechanisms. This paper is devoted to the evaluations of the\ngauge invariant electroweak functions that are relevant for the suppressed\nelectroweak processes within the SM or the UV finite theory in which the\nnoncontractible space breaks the gauge symmetry. Deviations from the SM\namplitudes range from 10% to 30%, thus being measurable at the LHCb and future\nsuperB factories. The most recent result of the LHCb, measuring certain B meson\nbranching fraction, appears to be lower than the SM prediction, thus favouring\nour theory of noncontractible space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 13:37:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 15:36:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 10:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}
