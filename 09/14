Present days models of\nradially pulsating stars assume radial symmetry and have the\npulsation-convection interaction included via model equations containing ad hoc\nclosures and moreover parameters whose values are barely known. We intend to\nconstruct ever more realistic multidimensional models of Cepheids. In the\npresent paper, the first of a series, we describe the basic numerical approach\nand how it is motivated by physical properties of these objects which are\nsometimes more, sometimes less obvious. - For the construction of appropriate\nmodels a polar grid co-moving with the mean radial velocity has been introduced\nto optimize radial resolution throughout the different pulsation phases. The\ngrid is radially stretched to account for the change of spatial scales due to\nvertical stratification and a new grid refinement scheme is introduced to\nresolve the upper, hydrogen ionisation zone where the gradient of temperature\nis steepest. We demonstrate that the simulations are not conservative when the\noriginal weighted essentially non-oscillatory method implemented in ANTARES is\nused and derive a new scheme which allows a conservative time evolution. The\nnumerical approximation of diffusion follows the same principles. Moreover, the\nradiative transfer solver has been modified to improve the efficiency of\ncalculations on parallel computers. We show that with these improvements the\nANTARES code can be used for realistic simulations of the convection-pulsation\ninteraction in Cepheids.

However,\nthe dependence of synchrony on patterns of among-patch movement across\nheterogeneous landscapes has been largely ignored. Here we consider the\nduration of movement between two predator-prey communities connected by weak\ndispersal, and its effect on population synchrony. More specifically, we\nintroduce time delayed dispersal to incorporate the finite transmission time\nbetween discrete populations across a continuous landscape. Reducing the system\nto a phase model using weakly connected network theory, it is found that the\ntime delay is an important factor determining the nature and stability of\nphase-locked states. Our analysis predicts enhanced convergence to stable\nsynchronous fluctuations in general, and a decreased ability of systems to\nproduce in-phase synchronization dynamics in the presence of delayed dispersal.\nThese results introduce delayed dispersal as a tool for understanding the\nimportance of dispersal time across a landscape matrix in affecting\nmetacommunity dynamics.

UM 448 exhibits complex emission line\nprofiles, with lines consisting of a narrow, central component, an underlying\nbroad component and a third, narrow blue-shifted component. Radial velocity\nmaps show signs of solid body rotation across UM 448, with a projected rotation\naxis that correlates with the continuum morphology of the galaxy. A\nspatially-resolved, chemodynamical analysis is presented. Whilst the eastern\ntail of UM 448 has electron temperatures (Te) that are typical of BCGs, we find\na region within the main body of the galaxy where the narrow and broad [O III]\n4363 line components trace temperatures differing by 5000K and oxygen\nabundances differing by 0.4 dex. We measure spatially resolved and integrated\nionic and elemental abundances for O, N, S and Ne throughout UM 448, and find\nthey do not agree, possibly due the flux-weighting of Te from the integrated\nspectrum. This has significant implications for abundances derived from\nlong-slit and integrated spectra of star-forming galaxies in the nearby and\ndistant universe.

For NFW or Einasto profiles (again, normalized to the minimum\nallowed density), the Galactic Center constraints are typically stronger than\nthose from dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 15:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 21:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Here we develop a set of\nmethods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns, and\ncorrelations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while\naccounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously\nimplemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of\n`standardized allele frequencies' that allows investigators to apply tests of\ntheir choice to multiple populations, while accounting for sampling and\ncovariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that\nthese standardized frequencies can be used to calculate powerful tests to\ndetect non-parametric correlations with environmental variables, which are also\nless prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate\nhow these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to\ndetect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure.

We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of\npopulation pools, which is a cost-efficient way to estimate population allele\nfrequencies, but it implies an additional level of sampling noise.

However if\nMajorana couplings are absent either in the Lepton or the dark sector, P\nsymmetry can be redefined to remove relative non-real intrinsic phases. It is\ntherefore predicted that neutrinos and dark matter fermions must have Majorana\nmasses if dark matter is stable due to parity.

Reliability is of particular interest in neuroscience, where large,\ncomplex networks of excitatory and inhibitory cells are ubiquitous. These\nnetworks are known to autonomously produce strongly chaotic dynamics - an\nobvious threat to reliability. Here, we show that such chaos persists in the\npresence of weak and strong stimuli, but that even in the presence of chaos,\nintermittent periods of highly reliable spiking often coexist with unreliable\nactivity. We elucidate the local dynamical mechanisms involved in this\nintermittent reliability, and investigate the relationship between this\nphenomenon and certain time-dependent attractors arising from the dynamics. A\nconclusion is that chaotic dynamics do not have to be an obstacle to precise\nspike responses, a fact with implications for signal coding in large networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 22:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2012 04:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 18:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

While a formal cohomology based\nclassification of such states was recently discovered, their physical\nproperties remain mysterious. Here we develop a field theoretic description of\nseveral of these states and show that they possess unusual surface states,\nwhich if gapped, must either break the underlying symmetry, or develop\ntopological order. In the latter case, symmetries are implemented in a way that\nis forbidden in a strictly two dimensional theory. While this is the usual fate\nof the surface states, exotic gapless states can also be realized. For example,\ntuning parameters can naturally lead to a deconfined quantum critical point or,\nin other situations, a fully symmetric vortex metal phase. We discuss cases\nwhere the topological phases are characterized by quantized magnetoelectric\nresponse \\theta, which, somewhat surprisingly, is an odd multiple of 2\\pi.

Explicit\nexpressions are presented for the matrix elements of the scattering Hamiltonian\nfor spin-1/2 and spin-1 polyatomic molecular radicals interacting with\nstructureless targets. The theory is applied to calculate the cross sections\nand thermal rate constants for spin relaxation in low-temperature collisions of\nthe prototypical organic molecule methylene [CH2(X)] with He atoms. To this\nend, two highly accurate three-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) of\nthe He-CH2(X) complex are developed using the state-of-the-art CCSD(T) method\nand large basis sets. Both PESs exhibit shallow minima and are weakly\nanisotropic. Our calculations show that spin relaxation in collisions of CH2,\nCHD, and CD2 molecules with He atoms occurs at a much slower rate than elastic\nscattering over a large range of temperatures (1 uK -- 1 K) and magnetic fields\n(0.01 - 1 T), suggesting excellent prospects for cryogenic helium buffer-gas\ncooling of ground-state ortho-CH2(X) molecules in a magnetic trap. Furthermore,\nwe find that ortho-CH2 undergoes collision-induced spin relaxation much more\nslowly than para-CH2, which indicates that magnetic trapping can be used to\nseparate nuclear spin isomers of open-shell polyatomic molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 01:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-17"}

We prove that at steady state, under inversion of velocities, the\ncondition of time-reversibility over the phase space is equivalent to the\nantisymmetry of spatial flux and the symmetry of velocity flux. Then we show\nthat the condition of time-reversibility alone could not always guarantee the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Comparing the two conditions together, we found\nthat the frictional force naturally emerges as the unique odd term of the total\nforce at thermodynamic equilibrium, and is followed by the Einstein relation.\nThe two conditions respectively correspond to two previously reported different\nentropy production rates. In case that the external force is only\nposition-dependent, the two entropy production rates become one. We prove that\nsuch an entropy production rate can be decomposed into two nonnegative terms,\nexpressed respectively by the conditional mean and variance of the\nthermodynamic force associated with the irreversible velocity flux at any given\nspatial coordinate. In the small inertia limit, the former term becomes the\nentropy production rate of the overdamped dynamics; while the anomalous entropy\nproduction rate originated from the latter term. Furthermore, regarding the\nconnection between the First Law and Second Law, we found that in the steady\nstate of such a limit, the anomalous entropy production rate is also the\nleading order of the Boltzmann-factor weighted difference between the spatial\nheat dissipation densities of the underdamped and overdamped dynamics, while\ntheir unweighted difference always tends to vanish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 03:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 08:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 06:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

In the present work, we utilize large scale\nmolecular dynamics simulations to report a novel beat phenomenon in [110]\noriented Ag nanowires. The beat phenomenon is found to arise from the asymmetry\nof the lattice spacing in the orthogonal elementary directions of the [110]\nnanowire,i.e., [-110] and [001] directions, which results in two different\nprincipal moments of inertia. Because of this, actuations imposed along any\nother direction are found to decompose into two orthogonal vibrational\ncomponents based on the actuation angle relative to these two elementary\ndirections, with this phenomenon being generalizable to <110> FCC nanowires of\ndifferent materials (Cu, Au, Ni, Pd and Pt).The beat phenomenon is explained\nusing a discrete moment of inertia model based on the hard sphere assumption,\nthe model is utilized to show that surface effects enhance the beat phenomenon,\nwhile the effect is reduced with increasing nanowires cross-sectional size or\naspect ratio.Most importantly, due to the existence of the beat phenomena, we\ndemonstrate that in resonance experiments only a single frequency component is\nexpected to be observed, particularly when the damping ratio is relatively\nlarge or very small.Furthermore, for a large range of actuation angles, the\nlower frequency is more likely to be detected than the higher one,which implies\nthe experimental predictions of Young's modulus obtained from resonance may in\nfact be under predictions.

A comprehensive analysis of the quality\n(Q)-factor, natural frequency, beat vibration, as well as high vibration mode\nis presented. Two excitation approaches, i.e., velocity excitation and\ndisplacement excitation, have been successfully implemented to achieve the\nvibration of NWs. Upon these two kinds of excitations, consistent results are\nobtained, i.e., the increase of the initial excitation amplitude will lead to a\ndecrease to the Q-factor, and moderate plastic deformation could increase the\nfirst natural frequency. Meanwhile, the beat vibration driven by a single\nrelative large excitation or two uniform excitations in both two lateral\ndirections is observed. It is concluded that the nonlinear changing trend of\nexternal energy magnitude does not necessary mean a non-constant Q-factor. In\nparticular, the first order natural frequency of the Ag NW is observed to\ndecrease with the increase of temperature. Furthermore, comparing with the\npredictions by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the MD simulation provides a larger\nand smaller first vibration frequency for the clamped-clamped and clamped-free\nthin Ag NWs, respectively. Additionally, for thin NWs, the first order natural\nfrequency exhibits a parabolic relationship with the excitation magnitudes. The\nfrequencies of the higher vibration modes tend to be low in comparison to\nEuler-Bernoulli beam theory predictions.

The major constraint of such a\ntechnology is the limited number of possible erase operations per block which\ntend to quickly provoke memory wear out.

So far, minor bodies temporarily trapped\nin the quasi-satellite dynamical state have been identified around Venus,\nEarth, the dwarf planet (1) Ceres, the large asteroid (4) Vesta, Jupiter,\nSaturn and Neptune. Using computer simulations, Tiscareno and Malhotra have\npredicted the existence of a small but significant population of minor bodies\nmoving in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with Pluto. Here we show using N-body\ncalculations that the Plutino 15810 (1994 JR1) is currently an accidental\nquasi-satellite of Pluto and it will remain as such for nearly 350,000 yr. By\naccidental we mean that the quasi-satellite phase is triggered (or terminated)\nnot by a direct gravitational influence in the form of a discrete close\nencounter but as a result of a resonance. The relative mean longitude of the\nPlutino circulates with a superimposed libration resulting from the oscillation\nof the orbital period induced by the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Neptune.\nThese quasi-satellite episodes are recurrent with a periodicity of nearly 2\nMyr. This makes 15810 the first minor body moving in a 1:1 mean motion\nresonance with Pluto. It also makes Pluto the second dwarf planet, besides\nCeres, to host a quasi-satellite. Our finding confirms that the quasi-satellite\nresonant phase is not restricted to small bodies orbiting major planets but is\npossible for dwarf planets/asteroids too. Moreover, 15810 could be considered\nas a possible secondary target for NASA's Pluto-Kuiper Belt Mission New\nHorizons after the main Pluto flyby in 2015.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 07:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

This is predicted by the usual weak lensing\nintegral of the density contrast along the line of sight. We show that this\nstandard effect is swamped at low redshifts by a relativistic Doppler term that\nis typically neglected. Contrary to the usual expectation, objects on the far\nside of a void are brighter than they would be otherwise. Thus the local\ndynamics of matter in and near the void is crucial and is only captured by the\nfull relativistic lensing convergence. There are also significant nonlinear\ncorrections to the relativistic linear theory, which we show actually\nunder-predicts the effect. We use exact solutions to estimate that these can be\nmore than 20% for deep voids.

In this paper, we\npresent a novel technique for measuring the density of modes (DOM) in a real\ngranular material, in which we mimic thermal excitations using white noise\nacoustic waves. The resulting vibrations are detected with piezoelectric\nsensors embedded inside a subset of the particles, from which we are able to\ncompute the DOM via the spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function, a\ntechnique previously applied in thermal systems. The velocity distribution for\nindividual particles is observed to be Gaussian, but the ensemble distribution\nis non-Gaussian due to varying widths of the individual distributions. In spite\nof this deviation from a true thermal system, we find that the DOM exhibits\nseveral thermal-like features, including Debye scaling in a compressed\nhexagonally ordered packing, and an increase in low-frequency modes as the\nconfining pressure is decreased. In disordered packings, we find that a\ncharacteristic frequency $f_c$ increases with pressure, but more weakly than\nhas been observed in simulations of frictionless packings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 11:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-17"}

One might expect these two concepts to be related, but\nunfortunately examples demonstrate that there is no way in general to deduce\nthe Krein signature of an eigenvalue from the Evans function.\n  The purpose of this paper is to recall and popularize a simple graphical\ninterpretation of the Krein signature well-known in the spectral theory of\npolynomial operator pencils. This interpretation avoids altogether the need to\nview the Krein signature in terms of root subspaces and their relation to\nindefinite quadratic forms. To demonstrate the utility of this graphical\ninterpretation of the Krein signature, we use it to define a simple\ngeneralization of the Evans function -- the Evans-Krein function -- that allows\nthe calculation of Krein signatures in a way that is easy to incorporate into\nexisting Evans function evaluation codes at virtually no additional\ncomputational cost. The graphical Krein signature also enables us to give\nelegant proofs of index theorems for linearized Hamiltonians in the finite\ndimensional setting: a general result implying as a corollary the generalized\nVakhitov-Kolokolov criterion (or Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss criterion) and a\ncount of real eigenvalues for linearized Hamiltonian systems in canonical form.\nThese applications demonstrate how the simple graphical nature of the Krein\nsignature may be easily exploited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 13:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 09:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-29"}
