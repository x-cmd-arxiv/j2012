One obvious implication is that models which predict\na significant departure from Standard Model phenomenology, such as large exotic\n(e.g., invisible) Higgs decay or mixing with a hidden sector scalar, are\nalready ruled out. This observation threatens the viability of electroweak\nbaryogenesis, which favors, for example, a lighter Higgs and a Higgs coupled to\nor mixed with light scalars. To assess the broad impact of these constraints,\nwe propose a scheme for classifying models of the electroweak phase transition\nand impose constraints on a class-by-class basis. We find that models, such as\nthe MSSM, which rely on thermal loop effects are severely constrained by the\nmeasurement of a 125 GeV Higgs. Models which rely on tree-level effects from a\nlight singlet are also restricted by invisible decay and mixing constraints.\nMoreover, we find that the parametric region favored by electroweak\nbaryogenesis often coincides with an enhanced symmetry point with a distinctive\nphenomenological character. In particular, enhancements arising through an\napproximate continuous symmetry are phenomenologically disfavored, in contrast\nwith enhancements from discrete symmetries. We also comment on the excess of\ndiphoton events observed by ATLAS and CMS. We note that although Higgs portal\nmodels can accommodate both enhanced diphoton decay and a strongly first order\nelectroweak phase transition, the former favors a negative Higgs portal\ncoupling whereas the latter favors a positive one, and therefore these two\nconstraints are at tension with one another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2012 17:25:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 02:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Extending earlier numerical studies of reconnection diffusion\nin cylindrical clouds, we consider more realistic clouds with spherical\ngravitational potentials and also account for the effects of the gas\nself-gravity. We demonstrate that within our setup RD is efficient. We have\nalso identified the conditions under which RD becomes strong enough to make an\ninitially subcritical cloud clump supercritical and induce its collapse. Our\nresults indicate that the formation of a supercritical core is regulated by a\ncomplex interplay between gravity, self-gravity, the magnetic field strength\nand nearly transonic and trans-Alfv\\'enic turbulence, confirming that RD is\nable to remove magnetic flux from collapsing clumps, but only a few of them\nbecome nearly critical or supercritical, sub-Alfv\\'enic cores, which is\nconsistent with the observations.

Finally, we have\nevaluated the effective values of the turbulent reconnection diffusion\ncoefficient and found that they are much larger than the numerical diffusion,\nespecially for initially trans-Alfv\\'enic clouds, ensuring that the detected\nmagnetic flux removal is due to to the action of the RD rather than to\nnumerical diffusivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2012 22:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 17:18:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 15:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The structure and radiation spectrum of the\nemerging so-called hot spot have been calculated in the LTE approximation. The\nemission not only in continuum but also in lines has been taken into account\nfor the first time when calculating the spot spectrum. Comparison with\nobservations has shown that the strongest of these lines manifest themselves as\nnarrow components of helium and metal emission lines, while the weaker ones\ndecrease significantly the depth of photospheric absorption lines, although\nuntil now, this effect has been thought to be due to the emission continuum\nalone. The veiling by lines changes the depth of different photospheric lines\nto a very different degree even within a narrow spectral range. Therefore, the\nnonmonotonic wavelength dependence of the degree of veiling r found for some\nCTTS does not suggest a nontrivial spectral energy distribution of the veiling\ncontinuum. In general, it makes sense to specify the degree of veiling r only\nby providing the set of photospheric lines from which this quantity was\ndetermined. We show that taking into account the contribution of lines to the\nveiling of the photospheric spectrum can cause the existing estimates of the\naccretion rate onto T Tauri stars to decrease by several times, with this being\nalso true for stars with a comparatively weakly veiled spectrum. Neglecting the\ncontribution of lines to the veiling can also lead to appreciable errors in\ndetermining the effective temperature, interstellar extinction, radial\nvelocity, and vsin(i).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2012 22:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

After that we introduce a system of hierarchically interacting\n$C^\\Lambda$-processes, where the interaction comes from migration and\nreshuffling-resampling based on measures $(\\Lambda_k)_{k}$ both acting in\n$k$-blocks of the hierarchical group.

The caches could be, for example,\nwithin the computers of users downloading videos from websites (such as\nNetflix, Blockbuster etc.), DVRs (such as TiVo, or cable boxes) used as part of\nvideo on demand services or public hot-spots (e.g. Wi-Fi access points with a\ncache) deployed over a city to serve content to mobile users. Each cache serves\nuser requests locally over a medium that incurs no additional costs (i.e. WiFi,\nhome LAN); if a request is not cached, it must be fetched from another cache or\na central server. In our model, each cache has a tiered back-haul internet\nconnection, with a usage cap (and fixed per-byte costs thereafter). Redirecting\nrequests intended for the central server to other caches with unused back-haul\ncapacity can bring down the network costs. Our goal is to develop a mechanism\nto optimally 1) place data into the caches and 2) route requests to caches to\nreduce the overall cost of content delivery.\n  We develop a multi-criteria approximation based on a LP rounding procedure\nthat with a small (constant factor) blow-up in storage and upload limits of\neach cache, gives a data placement that is within constant factor of the\noptimum. Further, to speed up the solution, we propose a technique to cluster\ncaches into groups, solve the data placement problem within a group, and\ncombine the results in the rounding phase to get the global solution.Based on\nextensive simulations, we show that our schemes perform very well in practice,\ngiving costs within $5--15$% to the optimal, and reducing the network load at a\ncentral server by as much as 55% with only a marginal blow up in the limits.\nAlso we demonstrate that our approach out-performs a non-cooperative caching\nmechanism by about 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 07:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

They show a decline after the peak\nshallower than others while the spectral index is similar. We show that all\nthese properties are naturally explained if the circumstellar material (CSM)\ndensity is low and therefore the forward shock is expanding into the CSM\nwithout deceleration. Since the forward shock velocity in this situation, as\nestimated from the radio properties, still records the maximum velocity of the\nSN ejecta following the shock breakout, observing these SNe in radio\nwavelengths provides new diagnostics on natures of the breakout and progenitor\nwhich otherwise requires a quite rapid follow-up in other wavelengths.

If efficiency declines and the commons is\nstructured in small groups, the most effective strategy resides in contributing\nonly when a majority of individuals are also contributors.

The \"q-scalars\" that emerge by\napplying the q-averages to the density, Hubble expansion and spatial curvature\n(which are common to FLRW models) are directly expressible in terms of\ncurvature and kinematic invariants and identically satisfy FLRW evolution laws\nwithout the back-reaction terms that characterize Buchert's average. The local\nand non-local fluctuations and perturbations with respect to the q-average\nconvey the effects of inhomogeneity through the ratio of curvature and\nkinematic invariants and the magnitude of radial gradients. All curvature and\nkinematic proper tensors that characterize the models are expressible as\nirreducible algebraic expansions on the metric and 4-velocity, whose\ncoefficients are the q-scalars and their linear and quadratic local\nfluctuations. All invariant contractions of these tensors are quadratic\nfluctuations, whose q-averages are directly and exactly related to statistical\ncorrelation moments of the density and Hubble expansion scalar. We explore the\napplication of this formalism to a definition of a gravitational entropy\nfunctional proposed by Hosoya et al (2004 Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 141302). We show\nthat a positive entropy production follows from a negative correlation between\nfluctuations of the density and Hubble scalar, providing a brief outline on its\nfulfillment in various LTB models and regions. While the q-average formalism is\nspecially suited for LTB and Szekeres models, it may provide a valuable\ntheoretical insight on the properties of scalar averaging in inhomogeneous\nspacetimes in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 12:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 01:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 23:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

They provide means to improve the convergence speed of these\nmethods by enriching the Krylov subspace with a deflation subspace. The most\ncommon approach for the construction of deflation subspaces is to use\n(approximate) eigenvectors, but also more general subspaces are applicable.\n  In this paper we discuss two results concerning the accuracy requirements\nwithin the deflated CG method. First we show that the effective condition\nnumber which bounds the convergence rate of the deflated conjugate gradient\nmethod depends asymptotically linearly on the size of the perturbations in the\ndeflation subspace. Second, we discuss the accuracy required in calculating the\ndeflating projection. This is crucial concerning the overall convergence of the\nmethod, and also allows to save some computational work.\n  To show these results, we use the fact that as a projection approach\ndeflation has many similarities to multigrid methods. In particular, recent\nresults relate the spectra of the deflated matrix to the spectra of the error\npropagator of twogrid methods. In the spirit of these results we show that the\neffective condition number can be bounded by the constant of a weak\napproximation property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 12:41:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 15:47:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 16:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 13:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

During the LHC\nPhase 1 (~first 10 years of operation) an ultimate luminosity is expected above\nits design value of 10^34/cm^2/s at 14 TeV. To prepare the machine and also the\nexperiments for this, two long shutdown periods are scheduled for 2013-2014 and\n2018-2019. The CMS Collaboration is planning several detector upgrades during\nthese long shutdowns. In particular, the muon detection system should be able\nto maintain a low-pT threshold for an efficient Level-1 Muon Trigger at high\nparticle rates. One of the measures to ensure this, is to extend the present\nRPC system with the addition of a 4th layer in both endcap regions.

We investigate the relative change in the shock\nstandoff distance, Sd, as a fraction of the CME radial half-width, Dob (i.e.\nSd/Dob). Previous hydrodynamic studies have related the shock standoff distance\nfor Earths magnetosphere to the density compression ratio (DR,Ru/Rd) measured\nacross the bow shock (Spreiter, Summers and Alksne 1966). The DR coefficient,\nkdr, which is the proportionality constant between the relative standoff\ndistance (Sd/Dob) and the compression ratio, was semi-empirically estimated as\n1.1. For CMEs, we show that this value varies linearly as a function of\nheliocentric distance and changes significantly for different radii of\ncurvature of the CMEs leading edge. We find that a value of 0.8+-0.1 is more\nappropriate for small heliocentric distances (<30Rs) which corresponds to the\nspherical geometry of a magnetosphere presented by Seiff (1962). As the CME\npropagates its cross section becomes more oblate and the kdr value increases\nlinearly with heliocentric distance, such that kdr= 1.1 is most appropriate at\na heliocentric distance of about 80Rs. For terrestrial distances (215Rs) we\nestimate kdr= 1.8+-0.3, which also indicates that the CME cross-sectional\nstructure is generally more oblate than that of Earths magnetosphere.

We stack HI line spectra\nextracted from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey centered on galaxies with UV\nimaging from GALEX and optical imaging/spectroscopy from SDSS. We use these\nstacked spectra to evaluate the mean atomic gas mass fraction of galaxies in\nbins of stellar mass and local density. For galaxies with stellar masses less\nthan 10^10.5 M_sun, the decline in mean atomic gas mass fraction with density\nis stronger than the decline in mean global and central specific star formation\nrate.

We compare our results with the\nsemi-analytic recipes of Guo et al. (2011) implemented on the Millennium II\nsimulation.

Quantitative\nestimates for heating and quadrature thermal noise squeezing near and below the\ntransition line of the first parametric instability zone of the oscillator are\ngiven. Furthermore, we give an intuitive explanation as to why heating and\nthermal squeezing occur. For small amplitudes of the parametric pump the\nFloquet multipliers are complex conjugate of each other with a constant\nmagnitude. As the pump amplitude is increased past a threshold value in the\nstable zone near the first parametric instability, the two Floquet multipliers\nbecome real and have different magnitudes.

When the pulsations are missed\nin the radio band, their detection at other wavelengths, like X-ray or\ngamma-rays, requires orbital demodulation, since the length of the observations\nare often comparable to, or longer than the system orbital period. The detailed\nknowledge of the orbital parameters of binary systems plays a crucial role in\nthe detection of the spin period of pulsars, since any uncertainty in their\ndetermination translates into a loss in the coherence of the signal during the\ndemodulation process. In this paper, we present an analytical study aimed at\nunveiling how the uncertainties in the orbital parameters might impact on\nperiodicity searches. We find a correlation between the power of the signal in\nthe demodulated arrival time series and the uncertainty in each of the orbital\nparameters. This correlation is also a function of the pulsar frequency. We\ntest our analytical results with numerical simulations, finding good agreement\nbetween them. Finally, we apply our study to the cases of LS 5039 and LS I +61\n303 and consider the current level of uncertainties in the orbital parameters\nof these systems and their impact on a possible detection of a hosted pulsar.\nWe also discuss the possible appearance of a sideband ambiguity in real data.\nThe latter can occur when, due to the use of uncertain orbital parameters, the\npower of a putative pulsar is distributed in frequencies lying nearby the\npulsar period.

It is determined\nthat the shear flow and field can fasten the damping of standing Alfven waves.\nIn spite of propagating Alfven waves, standing Alfven waves in Solar spicules\ndissipate in a few periods. As height increases, the perturbed velocity\namplitude does increase in contrast to the behavior of perturbed magnetic\nfield.

To identify critical properties of potential\nwind-driving dust species we use detailed radiation-hydrodynamical models which\ninclude a parameterized dust description, complemented by simple analytical\nestimates to help with the physical interpretation of the numerical results.\nThe adopted dust description is constructed to mimic different chemical and\noptical dust properties in order to systematically study the effects of a\nrealistic radiation field on the second stage of the mass loss mechanism. We\nsee distinct trends in which combinations of optical and chemical dust\nproperties are needed to trigger an outflow. Dust species with a low\ncondensation temperature and a NIR absorption coefficient that decreases\nstrongly with wavelength will not condense close enough to the stellar surface\nto be considered as potential wind-drivers. Our models confirm that metallic\niron and Fe-bearing silicates are not viable as wind-drivers due to their\nnear-infrared optical properties and resulting large condensation distances.\nTiO2 is also excluded as a wind-driver due to the low abundance of Ti.
