Using the COR2 coronagraphs and the heliospheric imagers (HIs), the\ninitial direction of both CMEs is determined to be slightly west of the\nSun-Earth line. We derive the CME kinematics, including the evolution of the\nCME expansion until 0.4 AU. We find that, during the interaction, the second\nCME decelerates from a speed above 500 km/s to 380 km/s the speed of the\nleading edge of the first CME. STEREO observes a complex structure composed of\ntwo different bright tracks in HI2-A but only one bright track in HI2-B. In\nsitu measurements from Wind show an \"isolated\" ICME, with the geometry of a\nflux rope preceded by a shock. Measurements in the sheath are consistent with\ndraping around the transient. By combining remote-sensing and in situ\nmeasurements, we determine that this event shows a clear instance of deflection\nof two CMEs after their collision, and we estimate the deflection of the first\nCME to be about 10 degrees towards the Sun-Earth line. The arrival time,\narrival speed and radius at Earth of the first CME are best predicted from\nremote-sensing observations taken before the collision of the CMEs. Due to the\nover-expansion of the CME after the collision, there are few, if any, signs of\ninteraction in in situ measurements. This study illustrates that complex\ninteractions during the Sun-to-Earth propagation may not be revealed by in situ\nmeasurements alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 16:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

By changing systematically the shear rates that symbolize the\ndegree of differential rotation in nascent proto-neutron stars (PNSs), we\nderive a scaling relation between the turbulent stress sustained by the MRI and\nthe shear- vorticity ratio. Our parametric survey shows a power-law scaling\nbetween the turbulent stress ($<< w_{\\rm tot}>>$) and the shear- vorticity\nratio ($g_q$) as $<<w_{\\rm tot}>> \\propto g_q^{\\delta}$ with its index $\\delta\n\\sim 0.5$. The MRI-amplified magnetic energy has a similar scaling relative to\nthe turbulent stress, while the Maxwell stress has slightly smaller power-law\nindex ($\\sim 0.36$). By modeling the effect of viscous heating rates due to the\nMRI turbulence, we show that the stronger magnetic fields or the larger shear\nrates initially imposed lead to the higher dissipation rates.

Unfortunately, these requirements are often too restrictive for many\npractical scenarios.

In this paper, we investigate\nthe attainable error/regret in the bandit and derivative-free settings, as a\nfunction of the dimension d and the available number of queries T. We provide a\nprecise characterization of the attainable performance for strongly-convex and\nsmooth functions, which also imply a non-trivial lower bound for more general\nproblems. Moreover, we prove that in both the bandit and derivative-free\nsetting, the required number of queries must scale at least quadratically with\nthe dimension.

As our hitting set is of size exp(lg^2 S), this is analogous (in the\nterminology of boolean pseudorandomness) to a seed-length of lg^2 S, which is\nthe seed length of the pseudorandom generators of Nisan and\nImpagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson for read-once oblivious boolean branching programs.\n  Our results are stronger for branching programs of bounded width, where we\ngive a hitting set of size exp(lg^2 S/lglg S), corresponding to a seed length\nof lg^2 S/lglg S. This is in stark contrast to the known results for read-once\noblivious boolean branching programs of bounded width, where no pseudorandom\ngenerator (or hitting set) with seed length o(lg^2 S) is known.\n  In follow up work, we strengthened a result of Mulmuley, and showed that\nderandomizing a particular case of the Noether Normalization Lemma is reducible\nto black-box PIT of read-once oblivious ABPs.

With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been made to\nclassify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation. However,\nrecent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such\nclassification schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some datasets\nhave also indicated non-solar abundances. In hot hydrogen-dominated\natmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative concentrations of\nseveral spectroscopically dominant molecules. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar\nvalue) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of\nmagnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN\nand C2H2 become prominent for C/O >= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost\nunchanged. Furthermore, a C/O >= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due\nto TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally\nunder-abundant for C/O >= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new two-dimensional\nclassification scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with\nirradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions.

Historically, galaxy formation models\nhave had difficulty explaining the observed number counts of SMGs. We combine a\nsemi-empirical model with 3-D hydrodynamical simulations and 3-D dust radiative\ntransfer to predict the number counts of unlensed SMGs. Because the stellar\nmass functions, gas and dust masses, and sizes of our galaxies are constrained\nto match observations, we can isolate uncertainties related to the dynamical\nevolution of galaxy mergers and the dust radiative transfer. The number counts\nand redshift distributions predicted by our model agree well with observations.\nIsolated disc galaxies dominate the faint (S_1.1 < ~1 mJy, or S_850 < ~2 mJy)\npopulation. The brighter sources are a mix of merger-induced starbursts and\ngalaxy-pair SMGs; the latter subpopulation accounts for ~30 - 50 per cent of\nall SMGs at all S_1.1 > ~0.5 mJy (S_850 > ~1 mJy). The mean redshifts are ~3.0\n- 3.5, depending on the flux cut, and the brightest sources tend to be at\nhigher redshifts. Because the galaxy-pair SMGs will be resolved into multiple\nfainter sources by ALMA, the bright ALMA counts should be as much as 2 times\nless than those observed using single-dish telescopes. The agreement between\nour model, which uses a Kroupa IMF, and observations suggests that the IMF in\nhigh-redshifts starbursts need not be top-heavy; if the IMF were top-heavy, our\nmodel would over-predict the number counts. We conclude that the difficulty\nsome models have reproducing the observed SMG counts is likely indicative of\nmore general problems -- such as an under-prediction of the abundance of\nmassive galaxies or a star formation rate--stellar mass relation normalisation\nlower than that observed -- rather than a problem specific to the SMG\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 13:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-19"}

The combined set of young\nbinaries, however, shows a distinct difference when compared to field binaries,\nwith a significant excess of close (19-100au) systems among the younger\nbinaries. Based on both the similarities and differences between individual\nregions, and between all seven young regions and the field, especially over\nseparation ranges too close to be modified by dynamical processing, we conclude\nthat multiple star formation is not universal and, by extension, the star\nformation process is not universal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

If there is a physical association of the HI\nstructure and the nova system, the asymmetric morphology and the off-centred\nstellar system indicates past strong interaction of the mass loss in the\nasymptotic giant branch phase with the surrounding interstellar medium. So far,\nthis is the second example, after GK Per, of a large HI structure associated\nwith a classical nova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 20:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-20"}

We provide detailed outer boundary conditions appropriate\nfor computing the evolution of cool white dwarfs employing detailed non-gray\nmodel atmospheres for pure H composition. We also explore the impact on the\nwhite dwarf cooling times of different assumptions for energy transfer in the\natmosphere of cool white dwarfs. Detailed non-gray model atmospheres are\ncomputed taken into account non-ideal effects in the gas equation of state and\nchemical equilibrium, collision-induced absorption from molecules, and the\nLyman alpha quasi-molecular opacity. Our results show that the use of detailed\nouter boundary conditions becomes relevant for effective temperatures lower\nthan 5800 and 6100K for sequences with 0.60 and 0.90 M_sun, respectively.\nDetailed model atmospheres predict ages that are up to approx 10% shorter at\nlog L/L_sun=-4 when compared with the ages derived using Eddington-like\napproximations at tau_Ross=2/3. We also analyze the effects of various\nassumptions and physical processes of relevance in the calculation of outer\nboundary conditions. In particular, we find that the Ly_alpha red wing\nabsorption does not affect substantially the evolution of white dwarfs. White\ndwarf cooling timescales are sensitive to the surface boundary conditions for\nT_eff < 6000K. Interestingly enough, non-gray effects have little consequences\non these cooling times at observable luminosities. In fact, collision-induced\nabsorption processes, which significantly affect the spectra and colors of old\nwhite dwarfs with hydrogen-rich atmospheres, have not noticeable effects in\ntheir cooling rates, except throughout the Rosseland mean opacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 22:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We present measurements of the\nstellar velocity dispersion in NGC 1569, a nearby post-starburst dIm galaxy.\nThe stellar vertical velocity dispersion, $\\sigma_{\\rm z}$, coupled with the\nmaximum rotational velocity derived from \\ion{H}{1} observations, $V_{\\rm\nmax}$, gives a measure of how kinematically hot the galaxy is, and, therefore,\nindicates its structure. We conclude that the stars in NGC 1569 are in a thick\ndisk with a $V_{\\rm max} / \\sigma_{\\rm z}$ = 2.4 $\\pm$ 0.7. In addition to the\nstructure, we analyze the ionized gas kinematics from \\ion{O}{3} observations\nalong the morphological major axis. These data show evidence for outflow from\nthe inner starburst region and a potential expanding shell near supermassive\nstar cluster (SSC) A. When compared to the stellar kinematics, the velocity\ndispersion of the stars increase in the region of SSC A supporting the\nhypothesis of an expanding shell. The stellar kinematics closely follow the\nmotion of the gas. Analysis of high resolution \\ion{H}{1} data clearly reveals\nthe presence of an \\ion{H}{1} cloud that appears to be impacting the eastern\nedge of NGC 1569. Also, an ultra-dense \\ion{H}{1} cloud can be seen extending\nto the west of the impacting \\ion{H}{1} cloud. This dense cloud is likely the\nremains of a dense \\ion{H}{1} bridge that extended through what is now the\ncentral starburst area. The impacting \\ion{H}{1} cloud was the catalyst for the\nstarburst, thus turning the dense gas into stars over a short timescale, $\\sim$\n1 Gyr. We performed a careful study of the spectral energy distribution using\ninfrared, optical, and ultraviolet photometry producing a state-of-the-art mass\nmodel for the stellar disk.

Our formalism facilitates an efficient approach to computing Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) anisotropies for cosmic strings.

This correlation may indicate the larger modification of nucleons with\nhigher momentum thus making the nucleon virtuality as the most relevant\nparameter of medium modifications. To check this conjecture we study the\nimplication of several properties of high momentum component of the nuclear\nwave function on the characteristics of EMC effect. We observe two main reasons\nfor the EMC-SRC correlation: first, the decrease of the contribution from the\nnuclear mean field due to the increase, with A, the fraction of the high\nmomentum component of nuclear wave function. Second, the increase of the medium\nmodification of nucleons in SRC. Our main prediction however is the increase of\nthe proton contribution to the EMC effect for large A asymmetric nuclei. This\nprediction is based on the recent observation of the strong dominance of pn\nSRCs in the high momentum component of nuclear wave function.

One natural scenario for energy\ninjection invokes a millisecond magnetar as the central engine of GRBs, because\nthe conventional model of a pulsar predicts a nearly constant\nmagnetic-dipole-radiation luminosity within the spin-down timescale. However,\nwe note that significant brightening occurs in some early afterglows, which\napparently conflicts with the above scenario. Here we propose a new model to\nexplain this significant brightening phenomena by considering a hyperaccreting\nfallback disk around a newborn millisecond magnetar. We show that for typical\nvalues of the model parameters, sufficient angular momentum of the accreted\nmatter is transferred to the magnetar and spins it up. It is this spin-up that\nleads to a dramatic increase of the magnetic dipole radiation luminosity with\ntime and thus significant brightening of an early afterglow. Based on this\nmodel, we carry out numerical calculations and fit well early afterglows of 12\nGRBs assuming sufficiently strong fallback accretion. If the accretion is very\nweak, our model turns out to be the conventional energy-injection scenario of a\npulsar. Therefore, our model can provide a unified explanation for the shallow\ndecay phase, plateaus, and significant brightening of early afterglows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 02:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Recently, it has received a considerable attention due to\nthe detection of peculiar variability patterns known as `heartbeats', which are\nquasi-periodic mini-outbursts repeated over timescales ranging between 5 and 70\ns. So far, such variability patterns have been observed only in GRS 1915+105\nand these are classified as $\\rho$- and $\\nu$-variability classes. Here, we\npresent the results of `phase-resolved' spectroscopy of the `heartbeat'\noscillations of IGR J17091-3624 using data from simultaneous observations made\nby RXTE and XMM-Newton.

We attempt to constrain the system parameters of the source by\nsimultaneously fitting spectra during different phases of the burst profile\nwhile tying the system parameters across the phases. The results indicate that\nthe source is a high inclination binary ($i$>53$^\\circ$). Further, the observed\nlow flux from the source can be explained only if the black hole spin is very\nlow, along with constraints on the black hole mass (<5 M$_\\odot$) and the\ndistance (>20 kpc). For higher inclination angles, which is favored by the\ndata, the black hole spin is required to be negative.

Since the capabilities and\nshortages of organizations for effort estimation are not the same, the proposed\nindicators can lead to have a systematic approach in which the strengths and\nweaknesses of organizations in field of effort estimation are discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 08:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-13"}

The combination\nof both enables us to infer the relative timepoint at which a given central Hox\nprotein type arose.

It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be\nintroduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can\nexecute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires point-of-sale (POS)\nterminals or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for\neach transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered that some EMV\nimplementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to\nsupply this number. This exposes them to a \"pre-play\" attack which is\nindistinguishable from card cloning from the standpoint of the logs available\nto the card-issuing bank, and can be carried out even if it is impossible to\nclone a card physically (in the sense of extracting the key material and\nloading it into another card). Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV\nwas supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a\nsurvey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence\nfrom ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of\nproof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest\nmanufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of\nfrauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards\ncannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be\nmistaken or complicit. Pre-play attacks may also be carried out by malware in\nan ATM or POS terminal, or by a man-in-the-middle between the terminal and the\nacquirer. We explore the design and implementation mistakes that enabled the\nflaw to evade detection until now: shortcomings of the EMV specification, of\nthe EMV kernel certification process, of implementation testing, formal\nanalysis, or monitoring customer complaints. Finally we discuss\ncountermeasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 09:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-14"}

However, we do not know whether\nGR is behind the physics governing stronger gravitational field regimes, such\nas near neutron stars or massive black-holes (MBHs). Gravitational-wave (GW)\nastronomy is a promising tool to test and validate GR and/or potential\nalternative theories of gravity. The information that a GW waveform carries not\nonly will allow us to map the strong gravitational field of its source, but\nalso determine the theory of gravity ruling its dynamics. In this work, we\nexplore the extent to which we could distinguish between GR and other theories\nof gravity through the detection of low-frequency GWs from extreme-mass-ratio\ninspirals (EMRIs) and, in particular, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons\nmodified gravity (DCSMG). To that end, we develop a framework that enables us,\nfor the first time, to perform a parameter estimation analysis for EMRIs in\nDCSMG. Our model is described by a 15-dimensional parameter space, that\nincludes the Chern-Simons (CS) parameter which characterises the deviation\nbetween the two theories, and our analysis is based on Fisher information\nmatrix techniques together with a (maximum-mismatch) criterion to assess the\nvalidity of our results.

We also\ncompare the characteristics with a simple wave model. We searched for\npropagating disturbances in open-loop structures at three different locations;\na fan loop-structure off-limb, an on-disk plume-like structure and the\nplume/interplume regions in the north pole of the sun. In each of the subfield\nregions chosen to cover these structures, the time series at each pixel\nlocation was subjected to wavelet analysis to find the different periodicities.\nWe then constructed powermaps in three different period ranges. We also\nconstructed space-time maps for the on-disk plume structure to estimate the\npropagation speeds in different channels. We find propagating disturbances in\nall three structures. Powermaps indicate that the power in the long-period\nrange is significant up to comparatively longer distances along the loop than\nthat in the shorter periods. This nature is observed in all three structures. A\ndetailed analysis on the on-disk plume structure gives consistently higher\npropagation speeds in the 193 \\AA channel and also reveals spatial damping\nalong the loop. The amplitude and the damping length values are lower in hotter\nchannels, indicating their acoustic dependence. These properties can be\nexplained very well with a propagating slow-wave model.

This dynamics is entitled NVU dynamics\nin analogy to standard energy-conserving Newtonian NVE dynamics. In the first\ntwo papers [Ingebrigtsen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 135, 104101 (2011); ibid,\n104102 (2011)], a numerical algorithm for simulating geodesic motion of atomic\nsystems was developed and tested against standard algorithms. The conclusion\nwas that the NVU algorithm has the same desirable properties as the Verlet\nalgorithm for Newtonian NVE dynamics, i.e., it is time-reversible and\nsymplectic. Additionally, it was concluded that NVU dynamics becomes equivalent\nto NVE dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper, the NVU algorithm\nfor atomic systems is extended to be able to simulate geodesic motion of\nmolecules at constant potential energy. We derive an algorithm for simulating\nrigid bonds and test this algorithm on three different systems: an asymmetric\ndumbbell model, Lewis-Wahnstrom OTP, and rigid SPC/E water. The rigid bonds\nintroduce additional constraints beyond that of constant potential energy for\natomic systems. The rigid-bond NVU algorithm conserves potential energy, bond\nlengths, and step length for indefinitely long runs. The quantities probed in\nsimulations give results identical to those of Nose-Hoover NVT dynamics. Since\nNose-Hoover NVT dynamics is known to give results equivalent to those of NVE\ndynamics, the latter results show that NVU dynamics becomes equivalent to NVE\ndynamics in the thermodynamic limit also for molecular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 11:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

Uncertain knowledge can\nbe modeled by using graded probabilities rather than binary truth-values. The\nmain technical problem studied in this paper is the following: Given a set of\nsentences, each having some probability of being true, what probability should\nbe ascribed to other (query) sentences? A natural wish-list, among others, is\nthat the probability distribution (i) is consistent with the knowledge base,\n(ii) allows for a consistent inference procedure and in particular (iii)\nreduces to deductive logic in the limit of probabilities being 0 and 1, (iv)\nallows (Bayesian) inductive reasoning and (v) learning in the limit and in\nparticular (vi) allows confirmation of universally quantified\nhypotheses/sentences.

However, for clusters with velocity dispersions smaller than\na few km/s the observed radial velocity distribution tends to be dominated by\nthe orbital motions of binaries rather than the stellar motions through the\npotential well of the cluster. Our goal is to characterize the intrinsic\nvelocity distribution of a cluster from a single epoch of radial velocity data,\neven for a cluster with a velocity dispersion of a fraction of a km/s, using a\nmaximum likelihood procedure. Assuming a period, mass ratio, and eccentricity\ndistribution for the binaries in the observed cluster this procedure fits a\ndynamical model describing the velocity distribution for the single stars and\ncenter of masses of the binaries, simultaneously with the radial velocities\ncaused by binary orbital motions, using all the information available in the\nobserved velocity distribution. We find that the fits to the intrinsic velocity\ndistribution depend only weakly on the binary properties assumed, so the\nuncertainty in the fitted parameters tends to be dominated by statistical\nuncertainties. Based on Monte Carlo simulations we provide an estimate of how\nthese statistical uncertainties vary with the velocity dispersion, binary\nfraction, and the number of observed stars, which can be used to estimate the\nsample size needed to reach a specific accuracy. Finally we test the method on\nthe well-studied open cluster NGC 188, showing that it can reproduce a velocity\ndispersion of only 0.5 km/s using a single epoch of the multi-epoch radial\nvelocity data. If the binary period, mass ratio, and eccentricity distribution\nof the observed stars are roughly known, this procedure can be used to correct\nfor the effect of binary orbital motions on an observed velocity distribution.\n[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 14:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Depending on the strength and\norientation of magnetic field, the PPB effect can result in the Stokes IV\nprofiles of a spectral line that differ significantly from those predicted by\nthe Zeeman effect theory. It is important to understand the size and types of\nerrors that are introduced into magnetic spectrum synthesis by treating such\nlines with the usual Zeeman splitting theory rather than using the correct\ntheoretical treatment of line splitting. To estimate the error introduced by\nthe use of the Zeeman approximation, numerical simulations have been performed\nfor spectral lines of the element silicon, for which a number of important\nlines are actually in the PPB regime, assuming an oblique rotator model, for\nvarious silicon abundances and Vsini values.

From the samples of J/psi and Z\nevents, the efficiencies for muons with and without the inclusion of the RPC\nhits in the muon track reconstruction are measured and compared with the\nsimulation. Using RPC information in track reconstruction improves up to about\n3% of offline reconstruction efficiency for the muons in the region of pT above\n7 GeV/c, in good agreement with simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 15:39:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 08:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 20:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

We analyzed panels of genetic reference populations and\nidentified the MAs in each panel and the MA content (MAC) that each strain\ncarried. We also analyzed 21 published GWAS datasets of human diseases and\nidentified the MAC of each case or control. MAC was nearly linearly linked to\nquantitative variations in numerous traits in model organisms, including life\nspan, tumor susceptibility, learning and memory, sensitivity to alcohol and\nanti-psychotic drugs, and two correlated traits poor reproductive fitness and\nstrong immunity. Similarly, in Europeans or European Americans, enrichment of\nMAs of fast but not slow evolutionary rate was linked to autoimmune and\nnumerous other diseases, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease,\npsychiatric disorders, alcohol and cocaine addictions, cancer, and less life\nspan. Therefore, both high and low MAC correlated with extreme values in many\ntraits, indicating stabilizing selection on most MAs. The methods here are\nbroadly applicable and may help solve the missing heritability problem in\ncomplex traits and diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 06:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 02:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

Perk's recent Comment\n(arXiv:1209.0731v1). We point out that the singularities of the reduced free\nenergy {\\beta}f, the free energy per site f and the free energy F of the 3D\nIsing model differ at {\\beta} = 0. The rigorous proof presented in the Perk's\nComment is only for the analyticity of the reduced free energy {\\beta}f, which\nloses its definition at {\\beta} = 0. Therefore, all of his objections lose the\nmathematical basis, which are thoroughly disproved. This means that the series\nexpansions cannot serve as a standard for judging the correctness of the exact\nsolution of the 3D Ising model. Furthermore, we note that there have been no\ncomments on the topology-based approach developed by Zhang for the exact\nsolution of the 3D Ising model. A Rejoinder to Professor J.H.H. Perk's open\nletter in arXiv:1209.0731v2 is added. We show that the analyticity in {\\beta}\nof both the hard-core and Ising models is proved for {\\beta} > 0, not for\n{\\beta} = 0. Furthermore, the free energy per site f and the reduced free\nenergy {\\beta}f lose their definitions at {\\beta} = 0, and thus either of them\ncould have two different forms for high-temperature series expansions at/below\ninfinite temperature.

The method is based on the Ising model and the\napproximation of the random field interaction. It is shown that in this\napproximation, the magnetization of the nanocrystal depends only on the number\nof nearest neighbors of the lattice atoms and the values of exchange integrals\nbetween them. This gives a good algorithmic problem of calculating the\nmagnetization of any nano-object, whether it is ultrathin film or nanoparticle\nof any shape and structure, managing only a rule of selection of nearest\nneighbors. By setting different values of exchange integrals, it is easy to\ndescribe ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets in a unified\nformalism. Having obtained the magnetization curve of the sample it is possible\nto find the Curie temperature as a function of, for example, the thickness of\nultrathin film.
