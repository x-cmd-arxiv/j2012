The structure and properties of HA,\nwhich is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected,\nchange significantly when the virus is transmitted from avian or swine species\nto humans. Previously we identified much smaller human individual evolutionary\namino acid mutational changes in NA, which cleaves sialic acid groups and is\nrequired for influenza virus replication. We showed that these smaller changes\ncan be monitored very accurately across many Uniprot and NCBI strains using\nhydropathicity scales to quantify the roughness of water film packages, which\nincreases gradually due to migration, but decreases abruptly under large-scale\nvaccination pressures. Here we show that, while HA evolution is much more\ncomplex, it still shows abrupt punctuation changes linked to those of NA. HA\nexhibits proteinquakes, which resemble earthquakes and are related to\nhydropathic shifting of sialic acid binding regions. HA proteinquakes based on\nsialic acid interactions are required for optimal balance between the\nreceptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities of HA and NA for efficient\nvirus replication. Our comprehensive results present an historical (1945-2011)\npanorama of HA evolution over thousands of strains, and are consistent with\nmany studies of HA and NA interactions based on a few mutations of a few\nstrains.

Although straightforward,\nthis approach cannot exploit the full potential offered by the probabilistic\nmodeling, as only the posterior mode is sought.

The emergence of techniques that allow the measurement of\ntheir local flow properties (velocity and volume fraction fields) has led to\nobserve new complex behaviors. It was shown that many of these materials\nexhibit shear banding in a homogeneous shear stress field, which cannot be\naccounted for by the standard steady-state constitutive laws of simple yield\nstress fluids. In some cases, it was also observed that the velocity fields\nunder various conditions cannot be modeled with a single constitutive law and\nthat nonlocal models are needed to describe the flows.

Objects with masses comparable to globular\nclusters (GCs) are called extended clusters (ECs), while objects with masses in\nthe dwarf galaxy regime are called ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). The\npaper analyses the observational parameters luminosity, effective radius, and\nprojected distance to the host galaxy, of all known ECs and UCDs and the\ndependence of these parameters on the type and the luminosity of their host\ngalaxy. We searched the available literature to compile a catalog of star\nclusters larger than 10 pc. As there is no clear distinction between ECs and\nUCDs, both types of objects will be called extended stellar objects (EOs). In\ntotal, we found 813 EOs of which 171 are associated with late-type and 642 with\nearly-type galaxies. EOs cover a luminosity range from about MV = -4 to -14\nmag. However, the vast majority of EOs brighter than -10 mag are associated\nwith elliptical galaxies. At each magnitude EOs are found with effective radii\nbetween 10 pc and an upper size limit, which shows a clear trend: the more\nluminous the object the larger is the upper size limit. For EOs associated with\nearly-and late-type galaxies, the luminosity functions peak at -6.40 and -6.47\nmag, respectively, which is about one magnitude fainter than the peak of the GC\nluminosity function. EOs and GCs form a coherent structure in the reff vs. MV\nparameter space, while there is a clear gap between EOs and early type dwarf\ngalaxies. However, there is a small potential overlap at the high-mass end,\nwhere the most extended EOs are close to the parameters of compact elliptical\ngalaxies. We compare the EO sample with numerical models and conclude that the\nparameters of the EO sample as a whole can be very well explained by a star\ncluster origin, where EOs are the results of merged cluster complexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Several remnants present distorted radio or X-ray\nshells with jet-like structures. G290.1-0.8 (MSH 11-61A) belongs to this class.\nWe aim to investigate the nature of this supernova remnant in order to unveil\nthe origin of its particular morphology. We based our work on the study of the\nX-ray emitting plasma properties and the conditions imposed by the cold\ninterstellar medium where the remnant expanded. We use archival radio, HI line\ndata and X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories, to study\nG290.1-0.8 and its surrounding medium. Spatially resolved spectral analysis and\nmean photon energy maps are used to obtain physical and geometrical parameters\nof the source. Radio continuum and HI line maps give crucial information to\nunderstand the radio/X-ray morphology. The X-ray images show that the remnant\npresents two opposite symmetric bright spots on a symmetry axis running towards\nthe NW-SE direction. Spectral analysis and mean photon energy maps confirm that\nthe physical conditions of the emitting plasma are not homogeneous throughout\nthe remnant. In fact, both bright spots have higher temperatures than the rest\nof the plasma and its constituents have not reached ionization equilibrium yet.\nHI line data reveal low density tube-like structures aligned along the same\ndirection. This evidence supports the idea that the particular X-ray morphology\nobserved is a direct consequence of the structure of the interstellar medium\nwhere the remnant evolved. However, the possibility that an undetected\npoint-like object, as a neutron star, exists within the remnant and contributes\nto the X-ray emission cannot be discarded. Finally, we suggest that a supernova\nexplosion due to the collapse of a high-mass star with a strong bipolar wind\ncan explain the supernova remnant morphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 20:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-24"}

The buoyancy of the fields is insufficient to lift\nup the magnetic arcade as a whole. Instead, weighted by the plasma that it\ncarries, the field is pinned down to the photosphere at several places in\nbetween the main footpoints, giving life to the MDFs and enabling channels of\ndownflowing plasma. MDF poles tend to drift towards each other, merge and\ndisappear.

We introduce a new routing paradigm called\ndispersive information routing, wherein the intermediate nodes are allowed to\n`split' a packet and forward subsets of the received bits on each of the\nforward paths. This paradigm opens up a rich class of research problems which\nfocus on the interplay between encoding and routing in a network. Unlike\nconventional routing methods such as in [1], dispersive information routing\nensures that each sink receives just the information needed to reconstruct the\nsources it is required to reproduce. We demonstrate using simple examples that\nour approach offers better asymptotic performance than conventional routing\ntechniques. This paradigm leads to a new information theoretic setup, which has\nnot been studied earlier. We propose a new coding scheme, using principles from\nmultiple descriptions encoding [2] and Han and Kobayashi decoding [3]. We show\nthat this coding scheme achieves the complete rate region for certain special\ncases of the general setup and thereby achieves the minimum communication cost\nunder this routing paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 22:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-21"}

This model over-predicts\nthe thermal photospheric emission and used to contradict observations.\nLightcurves at different energy bands revealed two distinguishable phases that\nmay come from different regions. First, we have an early phase, which is not\ndetected by LAT, and is dominated by lower energies, which arises from the\nphotospheric emissions without any emissions involved in dissipation mechanisms\nand characterized by low Lorentz factor and high radiation efficiency. This is\nfollowed by a later phase, having a more complex structure that remarkably\nfollows the same track in all energy bands and is attributed to emissions from\ninternal shocks. This burst is a good candidate to study both thermal and\nnon-thermal emissions, since the two phases can be clearly separated in\nlightcurve and spectrum. The rapid variation of Lorentz factor and the values\nof photospheric radii, which are relatively far away from the central engine in\nPhase 2, are more consistent with the mechanism of collisional heating in\nbaryonic jets.

We discuss results from ongoing B and V observations of the gam Cas\nstar-disk system acquired with an APT during the observing seasons 1997-2011.\nIn an earlier study, Smith, Henry, & Vishniac showed that light variations in\ngam Cas are dominated by a series of comparatively prominent cycles with\namplitudes of 0.02-0.03 mag and lengths of 2-3 months, superimposed on a\n1.21-day periodic signal some five times smaller, which they attributed to\nrotation. The cycle lengths clustered around 70 days. Changes in both cycle\nlength and amplitude were observed from year to year. These authors also found\nthe V-band cycles to be 30-40% larger than the B-band cycles. In the present\nstudy we find continued evidence for these variability patterns and for the\nbimodal distribution of the B/V amplitude ratios in the long cycles. During the\n2010 observing season, gam Cas underwent a mass loss event (outburst), as\nevidenced by the brightening and reddening seen in our new photometry. This\nepisode coincided with a waning of the amplitude in the ongoing cycle. The Be\noutburst ended the following year, and the light-curve amplitude returned to\npre-outburst levels. This behavior reinforces the interpretation that cycles\narise from a global disk instability. Remarkably, we also find that both the\namplitude and the asymmetry of the rotational waveform changed over the years.\nWe review arguments for this modulation arising from transits of a surface\nmagnetic disturbance. Finally, to a limit of 5 mmag, we find no evidence for\nany photometric variation corresponding to the gam Cas binary period, 203.55\ndays, or to the first few harmonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 00:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Nonetheless, even more than 20 years later, the\noriginal $O(n^2 \\log n)$ algorithm by Alt and Godau for computing the Fr\\'echet\ndistance remains the state of the art (here, $n$ denotes the number of edges on\neach curve). This has led Helmut Alt to conjecture that the associated decision\nproblem is 3SUM-hard.\n  In recent work, Agarwal et al. show how to break the quadratic barrier for\nthe discrete version of the Fr\\'echet distance, where one considers sequences\nof points instead of polygonal curves. Building on their work, we give a\nrandomized algorithm to compute the Fr\\'echet distance between two polygonal\ncurves in time $O(n^2 \\sqrt{\\log n}(\\log\\log n)^{3/2})$ on a pointer machine\nand in time $O(n^2(\\log\\log n)^2)$ on a word RAM. Furthermore, we show that\nthere exists an algebraic decision tree for the decision problem of depth\n$O(n^{2-\\varepsilon})$, for some $\\varepsilon > 0$. We believe that this\nreveals an intriguing new aspect of this well-studied problem. Finally, we show\nhow to obtain the first subquadratic algorithm for computing the weak Fr\\'echet\ndistance on a word RAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 01:06:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 23:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

The amorphous version studied here differs from the one reported earlier\n[PRB 46, 10917 (1992)] in that it has a much lower carrier concentration. As a\nmeasure of the static disorder we use the dimensionless parameter kFl. Thermal\nannealing is employed as the experimental handle to tune the disorder. On the\nmetallic side of the transition, the low temperature transport exhibits\nweak-localization and electron-electron correlation effects characteristic of\ndisordered electronic systems. The MIT occurs at a kFl~0.3 for both versions of\nthe amorphous material. However, in contrast with the results obtained on the\nelectron-rich version of this system, no sign of superconductivity is seen down\nto ~0.3K even for the most metallic sample used in the current study. This\ndemonstrates that using kFl as a disorder parameter for the\nsuperconductor-insulator-transition (SIT) is an ill defined procedure. A\nmicrostructural study of the films, employing high resolution chemical\nanalysis, gives evidence for spatial fluctuations of the stoichiometry. This\nbrings to light that, while the films are amorphous and show excellent\nuniformity in transport measurements of macroscopic samples, they contain\ncompositional fluctuations that extend over mesoscopic scales. It is argued\nthat this compositional disorder may be the reason for the apparent violation\nof the Ioffe-Regel criterion in the two versions of the amorphous indium-oxide.\nHowever, more dramatic effects due to this disorder are expected when\nsuperconductivity sets in, which are in fact consistent with the prominent\ntransport anomalies observed in the electron-rich version of indium-oxide.

In this paper, we study the baryon\nloading processes of a GRB jet launched from a black hole central engine. We\nconsider a relativistic jet powered by $\\nu \\bar\\nu$-annihilation or by the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We consider baryon loading from a\nneutrino-driven wind from a neutrino-cooling-dominated accretion flow. For a\nmagnetically dominated BZ jet, we consider neutron-drifting from the magnetic\nwall surrounding the jet and subsequent positron capture and proton-neutron\ninelastic collisions. The minumim baryon loads in both types of jet are\ncalculated. We find that in both cases, a more luminous jet tends to be more\nbaryon poor. A neutrino-driven \"fireball\" is typically \"dirtier\" than a\nmagnetically dominated jet, while a magnetically dominated jet can be much\ncleaner. Both models have the right scaling to interpret the empirical\n$\\Gamma-L_{\\rm iso}$ relation discovered recently.

In the\nsingle-degenerate (SD) scenario, the interaction between the SN blast wave and\nthe outer layers of a main sequence (MS) companion star strips off H-rich\nmaterial which is then mixed into the ejecta. Strong contamination of the SN\nejecta with stripped material could lead to a conflict with observations of SNe\nIa. This constrains the SD progenitor model. In this work, our previous\nsimulations based on simplified progenitor donor stars have been updated by\nadopting more realistic progenitor-system models that result from fully\ndetailed, state-of-the-art binary evolution calculations. We use Eggleton's\nstellar evolution code including the optically thick accretion wind model and\nthe possibility of the effects of accretion disk instabilities to obtain\nrealistic models of companions for different progenitor systems. The impact of\nthe SN blast wave on these companion stars is followed in three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations employing the SPH code GADGET3. We find that the\nstripped masses range from 0.11 to 0.18 M_sun. The kick velocity is between 51\nand 105 km/s. We find that the stripped mass and kick velocity depend on the\nratio of the orbital separation to the radius of a companion. They can be\nfitted by a power law for a given companion model. However, the structure of\nthe companion star is also important for the amount of stripped material. With\nmore realistic companion star models than in previous studies, our simulations\nshow that the H masses stripped from companions are inconsistent with the best\nobservational limits (< 0.01 M_sun) derived from nebular spectra. However, a\nrigorous forward modeling based on impact simulations with radiation transfer\nis required to reliably predict observable signatures of the stripped H and to\nconclusively assess the viability of the considered SN Ia progenitor scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 08:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

In particular, the relationship between the\nmass distribution of these clumps (also known as the \"clump mass function\", or\nCMF) and the stellar initial mass function (IMF), is still poorly understood.\nIn order to discern the \"true\" shape of the CMF and to better understand how\nthe CMF may evolve toward the IMF, large samples of bona-fide pre- and\nproto-stellar clumps are required. The sensitive observations of the Herschel\nSpace Observatory (HSO) are now allowing us to look at large clump populations\nin various clouds with different physical conditions. We analyse two fields in\nthe Galactic plane mapped by HSO during its science demonstration phase, as\npart of the more complete and unbiased Herschel infrared GALactic Plane Survey\n(Hi-GAL). These fields undergo a source-extraction and flux-estimation\npipeline, which allows us to obtain a sample with thousands of clumps. Starless\nand proto-stellar clumps are separated using both color and positional criteria\nto find those coincident with MIPS 24 micron sources. We describe the\nprobability density functions of the power-law and lognormal models that are\nused to fit the CMFs, and we then find their best-fit parameters. For the\nlognormal model we apply several statistical techniques to the data and compare\ntheir results. The CMFs of the two SDP fields show very similar shapes, but\nvery different mass scales. This similarity is confirmed by the values of the\nbest-fit parameters of either the power-law or lognormal model. The power-law\nmodel leads to almost identical CMF slopes, whereas the lognormal model shows\nthat the CMFs have similar widths. The similar CMF shape but different mass\nscale represents an evidence that the overall process of star formation in the\ntwo regions is very different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 09:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The resulting phase shifts are consistent with the weak and\nstrong forms of the Levinson theorem.

Because the\ncharacteristics of these stellar winds vary over the course of the evolution of\nthe star, the circumstellar matter becomes a reflection of the stellar\nevolution and can be used to determine the characteristics of the progenitor\nstar. In particular, whenever a fast wind phase follows a slow wind phase, the\nfast wind sweeps up its predecessor in a shell, which is observed as a\ncircumstellar nebula. We make 2-D and 3-D numerical simulations of fast stellar\nwinds sweeping up their slow predecessors to investigate whether numerical\nmodels of these shells have to be 3-D, or whether 2-D models are sufficient to\nreproduce the shells correctly. We focus on those situations where a fast\nWolf-Rayet (WR) star wind sweeps up the slower wind emitted by its predecessor,\nbeing either a red supergiant or a luminous blue variable. As the fast WR wind\nexpands, it creates a dense shell of swept up material that expands outward,\ndriven by the high pressure of the shocked WR wind. These shells are subject to\na fair variety of hydrodynamic-radiative instabilities. If the WR wind is\nexpanding into the wind of a luminous blue variable phase, the instabilities\nwill tend to form a fairly small-scale, regular filamentary lattice with thin\nfilaments connecting knotty features. If the WR wind is sweeping up a red\nsupergiant wind, the instabilities will form larger interconnected structures\nwith less regularity.

The single C+ fine structure transition is a\nvery important coolant of the atomic interstellar medium and of photon\ndominated regions in which carbon is partially or completely in ionized form.\nThe [CII] line is widely used as a tracer of star formation in the Milky Way\nand other galaxies. Excitation of the [CII] fine structure transition can be\nvia collisions with hydrogen molecules, atoms, and electrons. Velocity-resolved\nobservations of [CII] have become possible with the HIFI instrument on Herschel\nand the GREAT instrument on SOFIA. Analysis of these observations is\ncomplicated by the fact that it is difficult to determine the optical depth of\nthe [CII] line due to the relative weakness and blending of the components of\nthe analogous transition of 13C$+. We discuss the excitation and radiative\ntransition of the [CII] line, deriving analytic results for several limiting\ncases and carry out numerical solutions using a large velocity gradient model\nfor a more inclusive analysis. We show that for antenna temperatures up to 1/3\nof the brightness temperature of the gas kinetic temperature, the antenna\ntemperature is linearly proportional to the column density of C+ irrespective\nof the optical depth of the transition, which can be referred to as the\neffectively optically thin (EOT) approximation.

It is well known\nthat this model exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of the\ninteraction strength parameter K, in the limit of the number N of rotators\ngoing to infinity. A Fokker-Planck PDE captures the evolution of the empirical\nmeasure of the system as N goes to infinity, at least for finite times and when\nthe empirical measure of the system at time zero satisfies a law of large\nnumbers. The phase transition is reflected in the fact that the PDE for K above\nthe critical value has a stable manifold of stationary solutions, that are\nequivalent up to rotations. These stationary solutions are actually unimodal\ndensities parametrized by the position of their maximum (the synchronization\nphase or center). We characterize the dynamics on times of order N and we show\nsubstantial deviations from the behavior of the solutions of the PDE. In fact,\nif the empirical measure at time zero converges as N goes to infinity to a\nprobability measure (which is away from a thin set that we characterize) and if\ntime is speeded up by N, the empirical measure reaches almost instantaneously a\nsmall neighborhood of the stable manifold, to which it then sticks and on which\na non-trivial random dynamics takes place. In fact the synchronization center\nperforms a Brownian motion with a diffusion coefficient that we compute. Our\napproach therefore provides, for one of the basic statistical mechanics systems\nwith continuum symmetry, a detailed characterization of the macroscopic\ndeviations from the large scale limit -- or law of large numbers -- due to\nfinite size effects. But the interest for this model goes beyond statistical\nmechanics, since it plays a central role in a variety of scientific domains in\nwhich one aims at understanding synchronization phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 14:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-21"}

These three-body states (Efimov states) are found to be\nuniversal for ultracold atomic gases and the lowest Efimov state crosses the\nthree-body break-up threshold when the s-wave two-body scattering length is $a\n\\approx -9.73 r_{\\rm vdW}$, $r_{\\rm vdW}$ being the van der Waals length. This\narticle focuses on a generalized version of this Efimov scenario, where two of\nthe atoms are about to form a two-body d-wave dimer, which leads to strong\nd-wave interactions. In a recent paper [B. Gao, Phys. Rev. A. {\\bf 62},\n050702(R) (2000)], Bo Gao has predicted that for broad resonances the d-wave\ndimer is always formed near $a \\approx 0.956 r_{\\rm vdW}$. Here we find that a\nsingle universal three-body state associated with the d-wave dimer is also\nformed near the three-body break-up threshold at $a \\approx 1.09 r_{\\rm vdW}$\nand its signature can be found through enhancement of the three-body\nrecombination. The three-body effective potential curves that are crucial for\nunderstanding the recombination dynamics are also calculated and analyzed. An\nimproved method to calculate the couplings, effective potential curves, and\nrecombination rate coefficients is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 14:52:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Nov 2012 04:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We use the theory of the Fourier transform\nto connect localized features of the two-point correlation function in real\nspace to oscillations in the power spectrum. We also illustrate analytically\nand by means of Monte Carlo simulations the angular correlation function for\ndistributions of filled disks with fixed or variable radii capable of\ngenerating oscillations in the power spectrum. While the power spectrum shows\nrepeated information in the form of multiple peaks and oscillations, the\nangular correlation function offers a more compact presentation that condenses\nall the information of the multiple peaks into a localized real space feature.\nWe have seen that oscillations in the power spectrum arise when there is a\ndiscontinuity in a given derivative of the angular correlation function at a\ngiven angular distance. These kinds of discontinuities do not need to be abrupt\nin an infinitesimal range of angular distances but may also be smooth, and can\nbe generated by simply distributing excesses of antenna temperature in filled\ndisks of fixed or variable radii on the sky, provided that there is a non-null\nminimum radius and/or the maximum radius is constrained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 18:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This can be achieved by determining\nthe moving direction of the cutting tool such that the machined stripe is the\nwidest. From a technical point of view it is recommended that the angle between\nthe tool axis and the surface normal does not change too much along the tool\npath in order to ensure even abrasion of the tool. In this paper a mathematical\nmethod for tool path generation in 3-axis milling is presented, which considers\nthese requirements by combining the features of isophotic curves and principal\ncurvatures. It calculates the proposed moving direction of the tool at each\npoint of the surface. The proposed direction depends on the measurement of the\ntool and on the curvature values of the surface. For triangulated surfaces a\nnew local offset computation method is presented, which is suitable also for\ndetecting tool collision with the target surface and self intersection in the\noffset mesh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 13:07:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 12:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-06"}
