The standard description of relaxation as\ndiffusion provides a perturbative 2nd-order solution in the weak two-body\ninteraction limit. We run N-body simulations and find that this solution fails\nto describe the non-Gaussian relaxation on short timescale, which is strongly\ninfluenced by extreme events even in the weak limit, and is thus difficult to\ncharacterize and measure. We derive a non-perturbative solution for relaxation\nas an anomalous diffusion process, and develop a robust estimation technique to\nmeasure it in simulations. These enable us to analyze and model our numerical\nresults, and validate in detail, for the first time, this model of energy\nrelaxation around an MBH on all timescales. We derive the relation between the\nenergy diffusion time, t_E, and the time for a small perturbation to return to\nsteady state, t_r, in a relaxed, single mass cusp around a MBH.

The amplitude of the\nDLA-Lyman alpha cross-correlation depends on only one free parameter, the bias\nfactor of the DLA systems, once the Lyman alpha forest bias factors are known\nfrom independent Lyman alpha forest correlation measurements.

These fundamental\nquestions are closely related to a deeply rooted paradigm in developmental\nbiology that cell differentiation is irreversible. Yet, recently a growing body\nof research suggests the possibility of cell reprogramming, which offers the\npotential for us to convert one type of cell into another. Despite the\nsignificance of quantitative understandings of cell reprogramming, theoretical\nefforts often suffer from the complexity of large circuits maintaining cell\nphenotypes coupled at many different epigenetic and gene regulation levels. To\ncapture the global architecture of cell phenotypes, we propose an \"epigenetic\nstate network\" approach that translates the classical concept of an epigenetic\nlandscape into a simple-yet-predictive mathematical model.

However, the\nrandom walk may not be appropriate for modeling social phenomena, including\nepidemics and information diffusion, in which one node may interact with many\nothers at the same time, for example, by broadcasting the virus or information\nto its neighbors. To produce meaningful results, social network analysis\nalgorithms have to take into account the nature of interactions between the\nnodes. In this paper we classify dynamical processes as conservative and\nnon-conservative and relate them to well-known measures of centrality used in\nnetwork analysis: PageRank and Alpha-Centrality. We demonstrate, by ranking\nusers in online social networks used for broadcasting information, that\nnon-conservative Alpha-Centrality generally leads to a better agreement with an\nempirical ranking scheme than the conservative PageRank.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 19:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 20:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-31"}

Recent studies have shown that the redward evolution of beta with\ncosmic time from redshift 7 to 4 can be largely explained by a build up of\ndust. However, initial claims that faint z=7 galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep\nField WFC3/IR imaging (HUDF09) were blue enough to require stellar populations\nof zero reddening, low metallicity and young ages, hitherto unseen in\nstar-forming galaxies, have since been refuted and revised. Here we revisit the\nquestion of how best to measure the UV slope of z=7 galaxies through source\nrecovery simulations, within the context of present and future ultra-deep\nimaging from HST. We consider how source detection, selection and colour\nmeasurement have each biased the measurement of beta in previous studies. After\nfinding a robust method for measuring beta in the simulations (via a power law\nfit to all the available photometry), we remeasure the UV slopes of a sample of\npreviously published low luminosity z=7 galaxy candidates. The mean UV slope of\nfaint galaxies in this sample appears consistent with an intrinsic distribution\nof normal star-forming galaxies with beta=-2, although properly decoding the\nunderlying distribution will require further imaging from the ongoing HUDF12\nprogramme. We therefore go on to consider strategies for obtaining better\nconstraints on the underlying distribution of UV slopes at z=7 from these new\ndata, which will benefit particularly from the addition of imaging in a second\nJ-band filter: F140W.

We adopt power-laws to describe\nthe intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f_P ~ (log P)^\\pi\\ (with\n0.15 < log P < 3.5) and f_q ~ q^\\kappa\\ with 0.1 < q=M_2/M_1 < 1.0. The\npower-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are \\pi = -0.45\n+/- 0.30 and \\kappa = -1.0\\pm0.4. The obtained period distribution thus favours\nshorter period systems compared to an Oepik law. The mass ratio distribution is\nslightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with a\nrandom sampling of a classical mass function. The binary fraction seems mostly\nuniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types and\nluminosity classes. The binary fraction in the outer region of the field of\nview (r > 7.8', i.e. approx117 pc) and among the O9.7 I/II objects are however\nsignificantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations.\n  Conclusions. Using simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over\n50% of the current O star population in 30 Dor will exchange mass with its\ncompanion within a binary system. This shows that binary interaction is greatly\naffecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken into\naccount to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Based on this idea, we investigate the\nradial profiles of the mini-halos. First, using numerical simulations, we\nconfirm that it is appropriate to assume that radiative cooling of the\nintracluster medium (ICM) is balanced with the heating by CR streaming. In\nthese simulations, we assume that the streaming velocity of the CRs is the\nsound velocity of the ICM, and indicate that the heating is even more stable\nthan the case where the streaming velocity is the Alfven velocity. Then,\nactually assuming the balance between cooling and heating, we estimate the\nradial profiles of CR pressure in six clusters only from X-ray observations.\nSince the CR protons interact with the ICM protons, we can predict the radial\nprofiles of the resultant synchrotron radiation. We compare the predictions\nwith the observed radial profiles of the mini-halos in the six clusters and\nfind that they are consistent if the momentum spectra of the CRs are steep.\nThese results may indicate that the cores are actually being heated by the CRs.\nWe also predict broad-band spectra of the six clusters, and show that the\nnon-thermal fluxes from the clusters are small in hard X-ray and gamma-ray\nbands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We give\ntwo necessary conditions and show that the vectors $U$ have to be free. Given a\nset $U$ of free vectors, we give several methods for checking if $P + Z(U)$ is\na parallelotope. Using this we classify such zonotopes for some highly\nsymmetric lattices.\n  In the case of the root lattice $\\mathsf{E}_6$, it is possible to give a more\ngeometric description of the admissible sets of vectors $U$. We found that the\nset of admissible vectors, called free vectors, is described by the well-known\nconfiguration of $27$ lines in a cubic. Based on a detailed study of the\ngeometry of $P_V(\\mathsf{e}_6)$, we give a simple characterization of the\nconfigurations of vectors $U$ such that $P_V(\\mathsf{E}_6) + Z(U)$ is a\nparallelotope. The enumeration yields $10$ maximal families of vectors, which\nare presented by their description as regular matroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 20:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 20:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}

Sub-arcsecond positions enabled by\nradio detections lead to robust host galaxy associations, with optical\ndetections that indicate z < 4 (110709B) and 1.8 < z < 2.7 (111215A). Using the\nradio and X-ray data for each burst we find that GRB 110709B requires A_V > 5.3\nmag and GRB 111215A requires A_V > 8.5 mag (z=2), among the largest extinction\nvalues inferred for dark bursts to-date. The two bursts also exhibit large\nneutral hydrogen column densities (N_H > 10^22/cm^2; z=2) as inferred from\ntheir X-ray spectra, in agreement with the trend for dark GRBs.

The aim here\nis to exploit EVLA imaging at 8.4 GHz to establish the QSOs as radio/sub-mm\nsources. The challenge in reducing the EVLA data was the presence of a strong\n4C source in the field. A new calibration algorithm was applied to the data to\nsubtract it. The resulting thermal noise limited radio map covers the 16'x16'\nExtended WHDF. It contains 41 sources above a 4-sigma limit, 17 of which have\nprimary beam corrected flux. The radio observations show that the absorbed AGN\nwith LABOCA detections are coincident with radio sources, confirming the\ntendency for X-ray absorbed AGN to be sub-mm bright. These sources show strong\nultraviolet excess (UVX) suggesting the nuclear sightline is gas- but not\ndust-absorbed. Of the 3 remaining LABOCA sources within the ~5' half-power beam\nwidth, 1 is identified with a faint nuclear X-ray/radio source in a nearby\ngalaxy, 1 with a faint radio source and 1 is unidentified in any other band.\n  More generally, differential radio source counts are in good agreement with\nprevious observations, showing at S<50 micro-Jy a significant excess over a\npure AGN model. In the full area, of 10 sources fainter than this limit, 6 have\noptical counterparts of which 3 are UVX (i.e. likely QSOs) including the 2\nabsorbed quasar LABOCA sources. The other faint radio counterparts are not UVX\nbut are only slightly less blue and likely to be star-forming/merging galaxies,\npredominantly at lower luminosities and redshifts. The 4 faint, optically\nunidentified radio sources may be either dust obscured QSOs or galaxies.

All energy releases from resolved and\nunresolved extragalactic sources, and the light from any truly diffuse\nbackground, excluding the cosmic microwave background (CMB), contribute to its\nintensity and spectral energy distribution. It therefore plays a crucial role\nin cosmological tests for the formation and evolution of stellar objects and\ngalaxies, and for setting limits on exotic energy releases in the universe. The\nEBL also plays an important role in the propagation of very high energy\ngamma-rays which are attenuated en route to Earth by pair producing gamma-gamma\ninteractions with the EBL and CMB. The EBL affects the spectrum of the sources,\npredominantly blazars, in the ~10 GeV to 10 TeV energy regime. Knowledge of the\nEBL intensity and spectrum will allow the determination of the intrinsic blazar\nspectrum in a crucial energy regime that can be used to test particle\nacceleration mechanisms and VHE gamma-ray production models. Conversely,\nknowledge of the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum and the detection of blazars at\nincreasingly higher redshifts will set strong limits on the EBL and its\nevolution. This paper reviews the latest developments in the determination of\nthe EBL and its impact on the current understanding of the origin and\nproduction mechanisms of gamma-rays in blazars, and on energy releases in the\nuniverse. The review concludes with a summary and future directions in\nCherenkov Telescope Array techniques and in infrared ground-based and space\nobservatories that will greatly improve our knowledge of the EBL and the origin\nand production of very high energy gamma-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 20:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 21:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For example, it is desirable to have a small duty cycle in some low\npower systems; a half-duplex radio cannot keep transmitting if it wishes to\nreceive useful signals; and a cognitive radio needs to listen and detect\nprimary users frequently. This work studies the capacity of scalar\ndiscrete-time Gaussian channels subject to duty cycle constraint as well as\naverage transmit power constraint. An idealized duty cycle constraint is first\nstudied, which can be regarded as a requirement on the minimum fraction of\nnontransmissions or zero symbols in each codeword. A unique discrete input\ndistribution is shown to achieve the channel capacity. In many situations,\nnumerically optimized on-off signaling can achieve much higher rate than\nGaussian signaling over a deterministic transmission schedule. This is in part\nbecause the positions of nontransmissions in a codeword can convey information.\nFurthermore, a more realistic duty cycle constraint is studied, where the extra\ncost of transitions between transmissions and nontransmissions due to pulse\nshaping is accounted for. The capacity-achieving input is no longer independent\nover time and is hard to compute. A lower bound of the achievable rate as a\nfunction of the input distribution is shown to be maximized by a first-order\nMarkov input process, the distribution of which is also discrete and can be\ncomputed efficiently. The results in this paper suggest that, under various\nduty cycle constraints, departing from the usual paradigm of intermittent\npacket transmissions may yield substantial gain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 01:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-24"}

We propose a new\nparadigm to explain this observed coupling between the jet and the accretion\ndisk by investigating the extraction of the rotational energy of a BH when it\nis surrounded by different types of accretion disk. At low accretion rates\n(e.g., when $\\dot{m}\\lesssim0.1$), the accretion near the event horizon is\nquasi-spherical. The accreting plasmas fall onto the event horizon in a wide\nrange of latitudes, breaking down the force-free approximation near the\nhorizon. To incorporate the plasma inertia effect, we consider the\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) extraction of the rotational energy from BHs by the\naccreting MHD fluid, as described by the MHD Penrose process. It is found that\nthe energy extraction operates, and hence a relativistic jet is launched,\npreferentially when the accretion disk consists of an outer Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk (SSD) and an inner advection-dominated accretion flow. When the entire\naccretion disk type changes into an SSD, the jet is quenched because the\nplasmas brings more rest-mass energy than what is extracted from the hole\nelectromagnetically to stop the extraction. Several other observed BH disk-jet\ncouplings, such as why the radio luminosity increases with increasing X-ray\nluminosity until the radio emission drops, are also explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 05:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

We study the combined process of\nformation of Feshbach resonances; this enables the control of Feshbach\nresonance by varying the magnetic field and intensity and frequency of laser\nradiation. We obtain the cross-sections of elastic and inelastic scattering and\nshow that quenching of resonance occurs at the energy equal to that of the\nsystems ground state. Dependence of the cross-sections on the magnetic field\nand laser intensity is examined in detail. In all considered cases, the\nscattering length is obtained depending on the magnetic and laser fields are\nstudied. In the absence of magnetic interaction if the hyperfine substates of\nthe quasibound state in the closed channel and those of individual colliding\natoms in the open channel are the same, Feshbach resonances may arise via weak\ninteraction between nuclear and electronic motions, which leads to transitions\nbetween electronic states. The obtained results can be employed in new studies\nof collisions of cold atoms, e.g., of alkali metal atoms and for interpretation\nof new experiments in BECs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 07:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-24"}

Epitaxial graphene grown by the\nthermal decomposition of silicon carbide (SiC) is an ideal candidate for this\ndue to the large scale, uniform graphene layers produced. The experimental\nspectral function of epitaxial graphene on SiC has been extensively studied.\nHowever, until now the cause of an anisotropy in the spectral width of the\nFermi surface has not been determined. In the current work we show, by\ncomparison of the spectral function to a semi-empirical model, that the\nanisotropy is due to small scale rotational disorder ($\\sim\\pm$ 0.15$^{\\circ}$)\nof graphene domains in graphene grown on SiC(0001) samples. In addition to the\ndirect benefit in the understanding of graphene's electronic structure this\nwork suggests a mechanism to explain similar variations in related ARPES data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 08:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We\npropose a spread spectrum watermarking model with image restoration based on\nBayes estimation. We therefore need to assume some prior probabilities. The\nprobability for estimating the messages is given by the uniform distribution,\nand the ones for the image are given by the infinite range model and 2D Ising\nmodel. Any attacks from unauthorized users can be represented by channel\nmodels. We can obtain the estimated messages and image by maximizing the\nposterior probability.\n  We analyzed the performance of the proposed method by the replica method in\nthe case of the infinite range model. We first calculated the theoretical\nvalues of the bit error rate from obtained saddle point equations and then\nverified them by computer simulations. For this purpose, we assumed that the\nimage is binary and is generated from a given prior probability. We also assume\nthat attacks can be represented by the Gaussian channel. The computer\nsimulation retults agreed with the theoretical values.\n  In the case of prior probability given by the 2D Ising model, in which each\npixel is statically connected with four-neighbors, we evaluated the decoding\nperformance by computer simulations, since the replica theory could not be\napplied. Results using the 2D Ising model showed that the proposed method with\nimage restoration is as effective as the infinite range model for decoding\nmessages.\n  We compared the performances in a case in which the image was blind and one\nin which it was informed. The difference between these cases was small as long\nas the embedding and attack rates were small. This demonstrates that the\nproposed method with simultaneous estimation is effective as a watermarking\ndecoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 10:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 04:50:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 06:47:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 02:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

The equilibrium distribution\nfunctions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a\nrigid body. The magnetic equillibrium is obtained from the Grad-Shafranov\nequation for a rotating plasma and the slow (resistive) evolution of the\nmagnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety factor q.\nLarge-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given\nby neoclassical theory. The fluctuations are determined by the high-flow\ngyrokinetic equation, from which we derive the governing principle for\ngyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local cascade of free\nenergy. Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature\nand flow velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the\nneoclassical corrections and the fluctuations act back upon the mean profiles\nthrough fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy conservation laws for the\nmean profiles are derived. Total energy is conserved and there is no net\nturbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of fluxes flattening\ngradients, Ohmic heating, and the equilibration of mean temperatures. Finally,\nthis framework is condensed, in the low-Mach-number limit, to a concise set of\nequations suitable for numerical implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 10:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 18:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 09:27:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2013 18:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

One of the promising\ntechnologies which can satisfy this demand on high data rate mobile\ncommunications services is the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing\n(OFDM) transmission technology which falls under the general category of\nmulticarrier modulation systems. OFDM is a spectrally efficient modulation\ntechnique that can achieve high speed data transmission over multipath fading\nchannels without the need for powerful equalization techniques. However the\nprice paid for this high spectral efficiency and less intensive equalization is\nlow power efficiency. OFDM signals are very sensitive to non-linear effects due\nto the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which leads to the power\ninefficiency in the RF section of the transmitter.

For our study we have considered\nHamming codes, cyclic codes, convolution codes, Golay and Reed-Muller codes.\nThe results show that each of the channel coding technique has a different PAPR\nreduction performance.

The CoRoT space mission has been searching for transiting\nplanets since the end of December 2006. Aims. We aim to investigate the\ncapability of CoRoT to detect small-size transiting planets in short-period\norbits, and to compare the number of CoRoT planets with 2 \\leq R_p \\leq 4\nRearth with the occurrence rate of small-size planets provided by the\ndistribution of Kepler planetary candidates (Howard et al. 2012). Methods. We\nperformed a test that simulates transits of super-Earths and Neptunes in real\nCoRoT light curves and searches for them blindly by using the LAM transit\ndetection pipeline. Results. The CoRoT detection rate of planets with radius\nbetween 2 and 4 Rearth and orbital period P \\leq 20 days is 59% (31%) around\nstars brighter than r'=14.0 (15.5). By properly taking the CoRoT detection rate\nfor Neptune-size planets and the transit probability into account, we found\nthat according to the Kepler planet occurrence rate, CoRoT should have\ndiscovered 12 \\pm 2 Neptunes orbiting G and K dwarfs with P \\leq 17 days in six\nobservational runs.

We thus found a disagreement with expectations from Kepler at\n3 \\sigma or 5 \\sigma, assuming a blend fraction of 0% (six Neptunes) and 100%\n(one Neptune) for these candidates. Conclusions. This underabundance of CoRoT\nNeptunes with respect to Kepler may be due to several reasons. Regardless of\nthe origin of the disagreement, which needs to be investigated in more detail,\nthe noticeable deficiency of CoRoT Neptunes at short orbital periods seems to\nindirectly support the general trend found in Kepler data, i.e. that the\nfrequency of small-size planets increases with increasing orbital periods and\ndecreasing planet radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 18:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Methods: Millimetre wavelength maps of\nmolecular line and continuum emission towards the low-mass star forming region\nIRS7 near R CrA from the SMA and APEX are presented. The maps show the\ndistribution of 18 lines from 7 species (H2CO, CH3OH, HC3N, c-C3H2, HCN, CN and\nSiO) on scales from 3\" to 60\" (400-8000 AU).

Results: Most of the H2CO emission from the regions\nemerges from two elongated narrow ridges dominating the emission picked up in\nboth interferometric and single-dish measurements.

This is because photon noise in Stokes $Q$ and $U$ are interpreted\nby the inversion code as valid signals, that leads to an overestimation of the\ntransverse component $B_\\perp$, thus the inclination $\\gamma$. However, our\nstudy was based on the analysis of linear polarization signals that featured\nonly uncorrelated noise. In this paper, we develop this idea further and study\nthis effect in Stokes $Q$ and $U$ profiles that also show correlated noise. In\naddition, we extend our study to the three components of the magnetic field\nvector, as well as the magnetic filling factor $\\alpha$. With this, we confirm\nthe tendency to overestimate $\\gamma$ when inverting linear polarization\nprofiles that, although non-zero, are still below the noise level. We also\nestablish that the overestimation occurs mainly for magnetic fields that are\nnearly vertical $\\gamma \\lesssim 20\\deg$. This indicates that a reliable\ninference of the inclination of the magnetic field vector cannot be achieved by\nanalyzing only Stokes $I$ and $V$. In addition, when inverting Stokes $Q$ and\n$U$ profiles below the noise, the inversion code retrieves a randomly uniform\ndistribution of the azimuth of the magnetic field vector $\\phi$. To avoid these\nproblems, we propose only inverting Stokes profiles for which the linear\npolarization signals are sufficiently above the noise level. However, this\napproach is also biased because, in spite of allowing for a very accurate\nretrieval of the magnetic field vector from the selected Stokes profiles, it\nselects only profiles arising from highly inclined magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 14:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

These four low frequencies also determine the spacing of the higher\nfrequencies in and beyond the delta Sct pressure-mode frequency domain. In\nfact, most of the higher frequencies belong to one of three families with\nspacings linked to a specific dominant low frequency.

The representation is\nobtained introducing generalized coherent states for the environment, and is\nsuch that the evolution from a fully quantum environment to a classical one can\nbe inherently followed. The method is applied to the specific case where the\nprincipal system is a central qubit and the environment is a surrounding ring\nof interacting spins, with the overall Hamiltonian being that of the $s=1/2$\nHeisenberg star with frustration. In this case the quantum character of the\nenvironment, embodied by the total spin $S$ of the ring, can be physically\nvaried by acting on the ratio between the couplings entering the Hamiltonian,\nand formally followed by increasing $S$. We find that when the star is in any\nof its eigenstates, the qubit behaves as if it were under the effect of an\nexternal magnetic field, whose direction in real space is set by the variables\ndefining the environmental coherent states, and is hence broadened according to\ntheir quantum probability distribution.

Objectives: Examine the effect of ELF-MFs on cancer cells. Methods:\nFive cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of 0.025 to 5\nmicroT, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6 days.\nResults: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a\nmostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising\nreturn to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF\nincreases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions.\nOur data suggests that the karyotype contractions are caused by MF interference\nwith mitochondria's ATP synthase (ATPS), compensated by the action of\nAMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK). The effects of MFs are similar to those of\nthe ATPS inhibitor oligomycin. They are amplified by metformin, an AMPK\nstimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK inhibitor.

First we study properties of a\ndifferentially simple commutative ring R with respect to a set D of derivations\nof R. Among the others we investigate the relation between the D-simplicity of\nR and that of the local ring RP with respect to a prime ideal P of R and we\nprove a criterion about the D- simplicity of R in case where R is a\n1-dimensional (Krull dimension) finitely generated algebra over a field of\ncharacteristic zero and D is a singleton set. The above criterion was quoted\nwithout proof in an earlier paper of the author. Second we construct a special\nclass of iterated skew polynomial rings defined with respect to finite sets of\nderivations of a ring R (not necessarily commutative) commuting to each other.\nThe important thing in this class is that, if R is a commutative ring, then its\ndifferential simplicity is the necessary and sufficient condition for the\nsimplicity of the corresponding skew polynomial ring.\n  Key-Words- Derivations, Differentially simple rings, Finitely-generated\nalgebras, Iterated skew polynomial rings, Simple rings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 10:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-05"}
