Motivated by a real-world social\nchoice problem, mechanisms with verification are considered in a setting where\n(i) agents' declarations on allocated goods can be fully verified before\npayments are performed, and where (ii) verification is not used to punish\nagents whose declarations resulted in incorrect ones. Within this setting, a\nmechanism is designed that is shown to be truthful, efficient, and\nbudget-balanced, and where agents' utilities are fairly determined by the\nShapley value of suitable coalitional games. The proposed mechanism is however\nshown to be #P-complete. Thus, to deal with applications with many agents\ninvolved, two polynomial-time randomized variants are also proposed: one that\nis still truthful and efficient, and which is approximately budget-balanced\nwith high probability, and another one that is truthful in expectation, while\nstill budget-balanced and efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 16:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

Optical spectroscopic observations are used\nto constrain the spectral type of ionizing star HD 53623 as B0V. The classical\nnature of this H II region is affirmed by the low values of electron density\nand emission measure, which are calculated to be 756 cm^-3 and 9.15 x 10^5\ncm^-6 pc using the radio continuum observations at 610 and 1280 MHz, and VLA\narchival data at 1420 MHz. To understand local star formation, we identified\nthe young stellar object (YSO) candidates in a region of area ~ 7.5' x 7.5'\ncentered on Sh2-297 using grism slitless spectroscopy (to identify the Halpha\nemission line stars), and near infrared (NIR) observations. NIR YSO candidates\nare further classified into various evolutionary stages using color-color (CC)\nand color-magnitude (CM) diagrams, giving 50 red sources (H-K > 0.6) and 26\nClass II-like sources. The mass and age range of the YSOs are estimated to be ~\n0.1 - 2 Msolar and 0.5 - 2 Myr using optical (V/V-I) and NIR (J/J-H) CM\ndiagrams. The mean age of the YSOs is found to be ~ 1 Myr, which is of the\norder of dynamical age of 1.07 Myr of the H II region. Using the estimated\nrange of visual extinction (1.1 - 25 mag) from literature and NIR data for the\nregion, spectral energy distribution (SED) models have been implemented for\nselected YSOs which show masses and ages to be consistent with estimated\nvalues. The spatial distribution of YSOs shows an evolutionary sequence,\nsuggesting triggered star formation in the region. The star formation seems to\nhave propagated from the ionizing star towards the cold dark cloud LDN1657A\nlocated west of Sh2-297.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 17:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Even though these formulations were\ndeveloped for systems of particles as part of a larger system that includes a\nmeasurement apparatus, the analysis is carried out in terms of isolated\nparticles because excited state decay measurements are performed under\nconditions that approximate isolation. It is shown that the time evolution of\nthe wave function describing each particle in a sample of well-isolated\nidentical particles in their lowest excited state must satisfy the same branch\ntopology for all strictly SEL formulations. This topology describes a countably\ninfinite sequence of random branching events that occur at a rate lambda_B for\neach particle in the sample. Two more parameters are required: lambda_A, the\nexpectation value of the excited-state decay rate determined by an observer\nstate measuring the lifetime of the particles, and epsilon, the probability\nthat an observer state that branches off an observer state associated with the\nexcited state is associated with the excited state following the branching\nevent. There does not appear to be any way to determine the value of epsilon\nwithin the framework of SEL formulations. Therefore, contrary to Everett's\ngoal, SEL interpretations do not provide a complete description of every\nsystem. However, it is possible to show that lambda_A = (1-epsilon) lambda_B,\nwhich with the agreement between theoretical and experimental lifetime\ndeterminations provides a conservative upper limit of 0.1% for epsilon at the\ncurrent state of the art. This result is very different from the example of a\nsuperposition of states originally considered by Everett wherein the\nprobability of each final state is given by the conventional Born's rule and no\nnew parameters are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 22:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

To describe TE dynamics in populations, many previous studies have\nused models of transposition-selection equilibrium that rely on the assumption\nof a constant rate of transposition. However, since TE invasions are known to\nhappen in bursts through time, this assumption may not be reasonable in natural\npopulations. Here we propose a test of neutrality for TE insertions that does\nnot rely on the assumption of a constant transposition rate. We consider the\ncase of TE insertions that have been ascertained from a single haploid\nreference genome sequence and have subsequently had their allele frequency\nestimated in a population sample. By conditioning on the age of an individual\nTE insertion (using information contained in the number of substitutions that\nhave occurred within the TE sequence since insertion), we determine the\nprobability distribution for the insertion allele frequency in a population\nsample under neutrality. Taking models of varying population size into account,\nwe then evaluate predictions of our model against allele frequency data from\n190 retrotransposon insertions sampled from North American and African\npopulations of Drosophila melanogaster. Using this non-equilibrium model, we\nare able to explain about 80% of the variance in TE insertion allele\nfrequencies based on age alone. Controlling both for nonequilibrium dynamics of\ntransposition and host demography, we provide evidence for negative selection\nacting against most TEs as well as for positive selection acting on a small\nsubset of TEs. Our work establishes a new framework for the analysis of the\nevolutionary forces governing large insertion mutations like TEs, gene\nduplications or other copy number variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2012 03:20:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 03:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2013 03:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-04"}

By\nderivation of geometric bounds rather than eigenvalue bounds, it has been\nproved that for practical values of the code rate, the random error correction\ncapability of our codes is much better than those derived for previously\nstudied graph codes, including Zemor's bound. MATLAB simulations further reveal\nthat the average case performance of this code is 10 times better than these\ngeometric bounds obtained, in almost 99% of the test cases.

While it is in general a\nrobust indicator of the ongoing star formation activity, the precise value of\nthe calibration relating the UV luminosity to the SFR ($B_{\\nu}$), is sensitive\nto various physical properties, such as the recent star formation and metal\nenrichment histories, along with the choice of stellar initial mass function.\nThe distribution of these properties for the star-forming galaxy population\nthen suggests that the adoption of a single calibration is not appropriate\nunless properly qualified with the uncertainties on the calibration.

Another connected, and not\nyet well understood question is the relationship between the glassy and the\nvarious possible crystalline forms a system may adopt. In this context, B2O3 is\na puzzling case of study since i) it is one of the best glass-forming systems\ndespite an apparent lack of low-pressure polymorphism ii) it vitrifies in a\nglassy form abnormally different from the only known crystalline phase at\nambient pressure iii) it never crystallises from the melt unless pressure is\napplied, an intriguing behaviour known as the crystallisation anomaly. Here, by\nmeans of ab-initio calculations, we discover the existence of novel B2O3\ncrystalline polymorphs with structural properties similar to the glass and\nformation energies comparable to the known ambient crystal. The resulting\nconfigurational degeneracy drives the system vitrification at ambient pressure.\nThe degeneracy is lifted under pressure, unveiling the origin of the\ncrystallisation anomaly. This work reconciles the behaviour of B2O3 with that\nfrom other glassy systems and reaffirms the role played by polymorphism in a\nsystem's ability to vitrify. Some of the predicted crystals are cage-like\nmaterials entirely made of three-fold rings, opening new perspectives for the\nsynthesis of boron-based nanoporous materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2012 12:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

This feature can be very useful to probe the superdense core\nmatter of neutron stars, and the strong gravity regime. However, although many\nmodels exist in the literature, the physical origin of kHz QPO is not known,\nand hence this feature cannot be used as a tool yet. The energy dependence of\nkHz QPO fractional rms amplitude is an important piece of the jigsaw puzzle to\nunderstand the physical origin of this timing feature. It is known that the\nfractional rms amplitude increases with energy at lower energies. At higher\nenergies, the amplitude is usually believed to saturate, although this is not\nestablished. We combine tens of lower kHz QPOs from a neutron star LMXB 4U\n1728-34 in order to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio. Consequently, we, for\nthe first time to the best of our knowledge, find a significant and systematic\ndecrease of the fractional rms amplitude with energy at higher photon energies.\nAssuming an energy spectrum model, blackbody+powerlaw, we explore if the\nsinusoidal variation of a single spectral parameter can reproduce the above\nmentioned fractional rms amplitude behavior. Our analysis suggests that the\noscillation of any single blackbody parameter is favored over the oscillation\nof any single powerlaw parameter, in order to explain the measured amplitude\nbehavior.

Does Mozart effect point to a fundamental cognitive function of music?\nWould such an effect of music be due to the hedonicity, a fundamental dimension\nof mental experience? The present paper explores a recent hypothesis that music\nhelps to tolerate cognitive dissonances and thus enabled accumulation of\nknowledge and human cultural evolution (Perlovsky, 2010, 2012). We studied\nwhether the influence of music is related to its hedonicity and whether\npleasant or unpleasant music would influence scholarly test performance and\ncognitive dissonance. Specific hypotheses evaluated here are that during a test\nstudents experience contradictory cognitions that cause cognitive dissonances.\nIf some music helps to tolerate cognitive dissonances, then first, this music\nshould increase the duration during which participants can tolerate stressful\nconditions while evaluating test choices. Second, this should result in\nimproved performance. These hypotheses are tentatively confirmed in the\nreported experiments as the agreeable music was correlated with better\nperformance above that under indifferent or unpleasant music. It follows that\nmusic likely performs a fundamental cognitive function explaining the origin\nand evolution of musical ability considered previously a mystery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 16:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-19"}
