The\nonly type of non-degenerate stars that survive the limits on the companions of\nSNIa in SNR 0509-67.5 and SN1572 are M dwarfs. M dwarfs have special properties\nthat have not been considered in most work on the progenitors of SNIa: they\nhave small but finite magnetic fields, and they flare frequently. These\nproperties are explored in the context of SNIa progenitors. White dwarf/M dwarf\npairs may be sufficiently plentiful to provide an adequate rate of explosions.\nEven modest magnetic fields on the white dwarf and M dwarf will yield adequate\ntorques to lock the two stars together, resulting in a slowly rotating white\ndwarf, with the magnetic poles pointing at one another in the orbital plane.\nThe mass loss will be channeled by a \"magnetic bottle\" connecting the two\nstars, landing on a concentrated polar area on the white dwarf. This enhances\nthe effective rate of accretion compared to spherical accretion. Luminosity\nfrom accretion and hydrogen burning on the surface of the white dwarf may\ninduce self-excited mass transfer. The combined effects of self-excited mass\nloss, polar accretion, and magnetic inhibition of mixing of accretion layers\ngive possible means to beat the \"nova limit\" and grow the white dwarf to the\nChandrasekhar mass even at rather moderate mass accretion rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 16:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 23:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The star formation history and the\nchemical environment of this galaxy makes it an ideal target to observe dust\nproduction by high-mass stars in a low-metallicity environment. The goal of\nthis study is to identify oxygen-rich stars in IC 10 and to constrain their\nnature between asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs), red supergiants (RSGs),\nand other infrared bright sources. We examine the mass-loss rate of the stars\nand compare to results obtained for the Magellanic Clouds. Our objectives are\nto (1) assess whether RSGs can be significant dust producers in IC 10, and (2),\nsolve the discrepancy between the star formation history of IC 10 and the\nrelatively low number of RSGs detected in the optical. We search for silicate\ndust in emission by using the spectral map observed with the Infrared\nSpectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The optical (UBVRI) and\ninfrared (JHK, Spitzer/IRAC and Spitzer/MIPS) photometry is used to assert the\nmembership of the stars to IC 10 and disentangle between AGBs and RSGs.\nRadiative models are used to infer mass-loss rates and stellar luminosities.\nThe luminosity and colors of at least 9 silicate emission sources are\nconsistent with stars within IC 10. Furthermore, the photometry of 2 of these\nsources is consistent with RSGs. We derive dust mass-loss rates similar to the\nvalues found in the Magellanic Clouds.

Other than sequential\nsearch, the classic solution is to sort the list of numbers and then apply\nbinary search. The binary search problem has a complexity of O(logN) for a list\nof N numbers while the sorting problem cannot be better than O(N) on any\nsequential computer following the usual assumptions. Whenever the problem of\ndeciding partial order can be done in O(1), a variation of the problem on some\nbounded list of numbers is to apply binary search without resorting to sort.\nThe overall complexity of the problem is then O(log R) for some radius R. A\nlogarithmic upper-bound for finite encodings is shown. Also, the topology of\norderings can provide efficient algorithms for search problems in combinatorial\nspaces. The main characteristic of those spaces is that they have typical\nexponential space complexities. The factorial case describes an order topology\nthat can be illustrated using the combinatorial polytope .

Using a capillary bundle model, we show that the\ndifferential change in retained water per pressure increment is directly\nrelated to the cumulative cross-sectional area distribution $f(r)$ of the\nwater-accessible pores with radii less than $r$. This is validated by\nmeasurements of water expelled from a model sandy soil composed of 2 mm\ndiameter glass beads.

The first one, very classical, is the Goldie rank of an ideal. The\nsecond one is the dimension of an irreducible module corresponding to this\nideal over an appropriate finite W-algebra. We concentrate on the integral\ncentral character case. We prove, modulo a conjecture, that in this case the\ntwo are equal.

As a pilot\nproject, we measure abundances of several elements for three globular clusters\n(GCs) in the Fornax dSph, using VLT/UVES spectra. Methods: We divide the\ncluster colour-magnitude diagrams into about 100 bins and compute synthetic\nspectra for each bin. The individual model spectra are co-added and the\nabundances are iteratively adjusted until the best match to the observed\nspectra is achieved. Results: We find [Fe/H] = -2.3, -1.4 and -2.1 for Fornax\n3, 4 and 5, with +/-0.1 dex uncertainties. Fornax 3 and 5 are thus similar in\nmetallicity to the most metal-poor Milky Way GCs and fall near the extreme\nmetal-poor end of the field star metallicity distribution in Fornax. The\n[alpha/Fe] ratios, as traced by Ca and Ti, are enhanced with respect to the\nSolar composition at the level of about +0.25 dex for Fornax 3 and 5, and\npossibly slightly less (about +0.12 dex) for Fornax 4. For all three clusters\nthe [Mg/Fe] ratio is significantly less elevated than [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe],\npossibly an effect of the abundance anomalies that are well-known in Galactic\nGCs. We thus confirm that Mg may be a poor proxy for the overall alpha-element\nabundances for GCs. The abundance patterns of heavy elements (Y, Ba and Eu)\nindicate a dominant contribution to nucleosynthesis from the r-process in all\nthree clusters, with a mean [Ba/Eu]=-0.7, suggesting rapid formation of the\nGCs. Conclusions: Combining our results with literature data for Fornax 1 and\n2, four of the five Fornax GCs fall in the range -2.5<[Fe/H]<-2, while Fornax 4\nis substantially more metal-rich than the others.

We critically\nevaluate the usage of the MgII(2798A) and CIV(1549A) lines, and adjacent\ncontinuum bands, as estimators of M_BH and L/L_Edd, by focusing on sources\nwhere one of these lines is observed together with Hbeta.

The existence of two physically distinct quasar populations,\nthe radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, is controversial and over the last\ndecade a bimodal distribution of radio loudness of quasars has been both\naffirmed and disputed. We model the quasar radio luminosity distribution with\nsimple unimodal and bimodal distribution functions. The resulting simulated\nsamples are compared to a fiducial sample of 8,300 quasars drawn from the SDSS\nDR7 Quasar Catalog and combined with radio observations from the FIRST survey.\nOur results indicate that the SDSS-FIRST sample is best described by a radio\nloudness distribution which consists of two components, with 12+/-1 % of\nsources in the radio-loud component. On the other hand, the evidence for a\nlocal minimum in the loudness distribution (bimodality) is not strong and we\nfind that previous claims for its existence were probably affected by the\nincompleteness of the FIRST survey close to its faint limit. We also\ninvestigate the redshift and luminosity dependence of the radio loudness\ndistribution and find tentative evidence that at high redshift radio-loud\nquasars were rarer, on average \"louder\", and exhibited a smaller range in radio\nloudness. In agreement with other recent work, we conclude that the SDSS-FIRST\nsample strongly suggests that the radio loudness distribution of quasars is not\na universal function, and that more complex models than presented here are\nneeded to fully explain available observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-19"}

We obtain evidence that convergence with increasing resolution occurs\nwith both SPH and FARGO and in both cases we find that the critical cooling\ntimescale is larger than previously thought. We show that SPH has a first-order\nconvergence rate while FARGO converges with a second-order rate. We show that\nthe convergence of the critical cooling timescale for fragmentation depends\nlargely on the numerical viscosity employed in both SPH and FARGO. With SPH,\nparticle velocity dispersion may also play a role. We show that reducing the\ndissipation from the numerical viscosity leads to larger values of the critical\ncooling time at a given resolution. For SPH, we find that the effect of the\ndissipation due to the numerical viscosity is somewhat larger than had\npreviously been appreciated. In particular, we show that using a quadratic term\nin the SPH artificial viscosity (beta_{SPH}) that is too low appears to lead to\nexcess dissipation in gravitationally unstable discs, which may affect any\nresults that sensitively depend on the thermodynamics, such as disc\nfragmentation.

It is easy to implement in real time and it outperforms all\nprevious approaches. Simulation results show that the new approach has as good\ntracking properties as any other scheme, and that it reduces the average\ninverter switching frequency about 95% as compared to classical direct torque\ncontrol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 20:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-07"}

Admissible controllers are LTI and\nmust comply with a pre-selected sparsity pattern. The sparsity pattern is\nassumed to be quadratically invariant (QI) with respect to the plant, which,\nfrom prior results, guarantees that there is a convex parametrization of all\nadmissible stabilizing controllers provided that an initial admissible stable\nstabilizing controller is provided. This paper addresses the previously\nunsolved problem of determining necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of an admissible stabilizing controller. The main idea is to cast the\nexistence of such a controller as the feasibility of an exact model-matching\nproblem with stability restrictions, which can be tackled using existing\nmethods. Furthermore, we show that, when it exists, the solution of the\nmodel-matching problem can be used to compute an admissible stabilizing\ncontroller. This method also leads to a convex parametrization that may be\nviewed as an extension of Youla's classical approach so as to incorporate\nsparsity constraints. Applications of this parametrization on the design of\nnorm-optimal controllers via convex methods are also explored. An illustrative\nexample is provided, and a special case is discussed for which the exact model\nmatching problem has a unique and easily computable solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 21:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-07"}

The main results are the following: (1) If the\nmagnetosphere of the star corotates approximately with the inner disc, then we\nobserve a strong one-armed bending wave (a warp). This warp corotates with the\nstar and has a maximum amplitude between corotation radius and the radius of\nthe vertical resonance. The disc's center of mass can deviate from the\nequatorial plane up to the distance of z_w\\approx 0.1 r. However, the effective\nheight of the warp can be larger, h_w \\approx 0.3 r due to the finite thickness\nof the disc. Stars with a range of misalignment angles excite warps. However,\nthe amplitude of the warps is larger for misalignment angles between 15 and 60\ndegrees. (2) If the magnetosphere rotates slower, than the inner disc, then a\nbending wave is excited at the disc-magnetosphere boundary, but does not form a\nlarge-scale warp. Instead, high-frequency oscillations become strong at the\ninner region of the disc. These are (a) trapped density waves which form inside\nthe radius where the disc angular velocity has a maximum, and (b) inner bending\nwaves which appear in the case of accretion through magnetic Raleigh-Taylor\ninstability. These two types of waves are connected with the inner disc and\ntheir frequencies will vary with accretion rate. Bending oscillations at lower\nfrequencies are also excited including global oscillations of the disc. In\ncases where the simulation region is small, slowly-precessing warp forms.\nSimulations are applicable to young stars, cataclysmic variables, and accreting\nmillisecond pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 02:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 19:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

Although the WC-to-WN ratio we find for M31\nis much lower than that found by previous studies, it is still higher than what\nthe Geneva evolutionary models predict.

We compare the model\npredictions of the K-band luminosity evolution and the J-K, V-I and I-K colour\nevolution with a series of datasets, including Collins et al. (Nature, 2009)\nwho argued that semi-analytic models based on the Millennium simulation cannot\nreproduce the red colours and high luminosity of BCGs at z>1.

An\nanalysis of the model BCGs shows an increase in mass by a factor ~2 since z~1,\nand star formation activity down to low redshifts. While the consensus\nregarding BCGs is that they are passively evolving, we argue that this\nconclusion is affected by the degeneracy between star formation history and\nstellar population models used in SED-fitting, and by the inefficacy of\ntoy-models of passive evolution to capture the complexity of real galaxies,\nexpecially those with rich merger histories like BCGs. Following this argument,\nwe also show that in the semi-analytic model the BCGs show a realistic mix of\nstellar populations, and that these stellar populations are mostly old. In\naddition, the age-redshift relation of the model BCGs follows that of the\nuniverse, meaning that given their merger history and star formation history,\nthe ageing of BCGs is always dominated by the ageing of their stellar\npopulations.

The reason for introducing an\neffective approach in the Higgs physics is that the simple supersymmetric\nextension of the Standard Model (the MSSM) is known to have a tightly\nconstrained Higgs sector, in particular with a lightest Higgs mass difficult to\nraise without introducing some fine-tuning. Many specific expansions (as the\nNMSSM for instance) allow for a richer Higgs sector. In this case however, the\neffective approach is handy since it encompasses many different specific\nultraviolet completions. We have added to the Kahler and superpotential of the\nMSSM all possible terms of dimensions 5 and 6 including only Higgs superfields.\nThe phenomenology of the resulting Higgs sector appears to be much richer, and\nwe analyse our model in view of the latest LHC results. On the other side,\nsupersymmetry is known for providing a Dark Matter candidate, so we have also\nworked to improve the accuracy of the computation of the relic density in the\nMSSM. Indeed the impressive accuracy on the experimental side (around 6%) calls\nfor a precise computation including radiative corrections. Those one-loop\ncomputations being rather long in the MSSM, thus often overlooked, we have used\nagain the effective approach by introducing new effective vertices that aim at\naccounting for the one-loop correction.

The entire LAE population in the\n53W002 field has an average number density and distributions of equivalent\nwidth and size that are similar to those of other fields at z ~ 2. We identify\na significant high density region (53W002F-HDR) that spreads over ~ 5' x 4'\nnear 53W002 where the LAE number density is nearly four times as large as the\naverage of the entire field. Using the probability distribution function of\ndensity fluctuation, we evaluate the rareness probability of the 53W002F-HDR to\nbe 0.9^{+2.4}_{-0.62}%, which corresponds to a moderately rich structure. No\nnotable environmental dependency at the comoving scale of 10 Mpc is found for\nthe distributions of the Ly\\alpha equivalent width and luminosity in the field.\nWe also detected 4 Ly\\alpha blobs (LABs), one of which is newly discovered.\nThey are all found to be located in the rims of high density regions. The\nbiased location and unique morphologies in Ly\\alpha suggest that galaxy\ninteraction play a key role in their formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 11:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Aligned\nwith the jet and 10 arcmin northeast of HH 80N, we found a radio source not\nreported before, with a negative spectral index similar to that HH 80, HH 81\nand HH 80N. The fit of a precessing jet model to the knots of the HH 80/81/80N\njet, including the new source, shows that the position of this source is close\nto the jet path resulting from the modeling. If the new source belongs to the\nHH 80/81/80N jet, its derived size and dynamical age are 18.4 pc and >9000 yr,\nrespectively. If the jet is symmetric, its southern lobe would expand beyond\nthe cloud edge resulting in an asymmetric appearance of the jet. Based on the\nupdated dynamical age, we speculate on the possibility that the HH 80/81/80N\njet triggered the star formation observed in a dense core found ahead of HH\n80N, which shows signposts of interaction with the jet. These results indicate\nthat pc scale radio jets can play a role on the stability of dense clumps and\nthe regulation of star formation in the molecular cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 11:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

It soon turned out that\nTFPLs possess a number of other nice properties. For instance, they can be seen\nas a generalized model of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We start our\narticle by introducing oriented versions of TFPLs; their main advantage in\ncomparison with ordinary TFPLs is that they involve only local constraints.\nThree main contributions are provided. Firstly, we show that the number of\nordinary TFPLs can be extracted from a weighted enumeration of oriented TFPLs\nand thus it suffices to consider the latter. Secondly, we decompose oriented\nTFPLs into two matchings and use a classical bijection to obtain two families\nof nonintersecting lattice paths (path tangles). This point of view turns out\nto be extremely useful for giving easy proofs of previously known conditions on\nthe boundary of TFPLs necessary for them to exist. One example is the\ninequality d(u)+d(v)<=d(w) where u,v,w are 01-words that encode the boundary\nconditions of ordinary TFPLs and d(u) is the number of cells in the Ferrers\ndiagram associated with u. In the third part we consider TFPLs with d(w)-\nd(u)-d(v)=0,1; in the first case their numbers are given by\nLittlewood-Richardson coefficients, but also in the second case we provide\nformulas that are in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

Inflation, an\nexponential expansion in the first 10^-36s, is a promising potential\nexplanation. A generic prediction of inflation is odd-parity (B-mode)\npolarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The Q/U Imaging\nExperimenT (QUIET) aimed to limit or detect this polarization.\n  We built a coherent pseudo-correlation microwave polarimeter. An array of\nmass-produced modules populated the focal plane of a 1.4m telescope. Each\nmodule had a sensitivity to polarization of 756muK sqrt{s} with a bandwidth of\n10.7+/-1.1 GHz centered at 94.5+/-0.8 GHz; the combined sensitivity was\n87+/-7muK sqrt{s}. We incorporated deck rotation, an absorbing ground screen, a\nnew time-stream double-demodulation technique, and optimized optics into the\ndesign to reduce instrumental polarization. We observed with this instrument at\nthe Atacama Plateau in Chile between August 2009 and December 2010.

This effect is in diametrical opposition to the\nexistence of criticality for the minimum interaction strength necessary to\nbreak chiral symmetry dynamically. The presence of virtual fermions dictates\nthe nature of phase transition. Miransky scaling laws for the electromagnetic\ninteraction strength and the four-fermion coupling, observed for quenched QED,\nare replaced by a mean-field power law behavior corresponding to a second order\nphase transition. These results are derived analytically by employing the\nbifurcation analysis, and are later confirmed numerically by solving the\noriginal non-linearized gap equation. A three dimensional critical surface is\ndrawn to clearly depict the interplay of the relative strengths of interactions\nand number of flavors to separate the two phases. We also compute the\nbeta-function and observe that it has ultraviolet fixed point. The power law\npart of the momentum dependence, describing the mass function, reproduces the\nquenched limit trivially. We also comment on the continuum limit and the\ntriviality of QED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 14:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

In recent years it has been shown that a number\nof non-linear scalar field theories allow for a dynamical mechanism, such as\nthe Vainshtein and chameleon ones, that suppresses the strength of the scalar\nfifth force in experimental environments. This is known as screening, however\nit is unclear how common screening is within non-linear scalar field theories.\nk-essence models are commonly studied examples of non-linear models, with DBI\nas the best motivated example, and so we ask whether these non-linearities are\nable to screen a scalar fifth force. We find that a Vainshtein-like screening\nmechanism exists for such models although with limited applicability. For\ninstance, we cannot find a screening mechanism for DBI models. On the other\nhand, we construct a large class of k-essence models which lead to the\nacceleration of the Universe in the recent past for which the fifth force\nmediated by the scalar can be screened.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 14:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

However, the physical\nconditions of the spirals are still not well understood. The origin of the\nasymmetric thermal emission is unclear.\n  We observed the disk at 230 GHz (1.3 mm) in both the continuum and the\nspectral line ^12CO J=2-1 with IRAM 30-m, the Plateau de Bure interferometer,\nand the Submillimeter Array to sample all spatial scales from 0.37\" to about\n50\". To combine the data obtained from these telescopes, several methods and\ncalibration issues were checked and discussed.\n  The 1.3 mm continuum (dust) emission is resolved into inner disk and outer\nring. Molecular gas at high velocities traced by the CO line is detected next\nto the stellar location. The inclination angle of the disk is found to decrease\ntoward the center. On a larger scale, based on the intensity weighted\ndispersion and the integrated intensity map of ^12CO J=2-1, four spirals are\nidentified, where two of them are also detected in the near infrared. The total\ngas mass of the 4 spirals (M_spiral) is 10^-7 < M_spiral < 10^-5 M_sun, which\nis 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the mass of the gas ring. Surprisingly,\nthe CO gas inside the spiral is apparently counter-rotating with respect to the\nCO disk, and it only exhibits small radial motion.\n  The wide gap, the warped disk, and the asymmetric dust ring suggest that\nthere is an undetected companion with a mass of 0.03 M_sun at a radius of 45\nAU. Although an hypothetical fly-by cannot be ruled out, the most likely\nexplanation of the AB Aurigae system may be inhomogeneous accretion well above\nor below the main disk plane from the remnant envelope, which can explain both\nthe rotation and large-scale motions detected with the 30-m image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 14:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 00:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A joint source-channel code maps a\nblock of $k$ source symbols onto a length$-n$ channel codeword, and the\nfidelity of reproduction at the receiver end is measured by the probability\n$\\epsilon$ that the distortion exceeds a given threshold $d$. For memoryless\nsources and channels, it is demonstrated that the parameters of the best joint\nsource-channel code must satisfy $nC - kR(d) \\approx \\sqrt{nV + k \\mathcal\nV(d)} Q(\\epsilon)$, where $C$ and $V$ are the channel capacity and channel\ndispersion, respectively; $R(d)$ and $\\mathcal V(d)$ are the source\nrate-distortion and rate-dispersion functions; and $Q$ is the standard Gaussian\ncomplementary cdf.

This means that during a\ntypical 40 year career the amount of new literature produced each year\nincreases by a factor of four. The methods scholars use to discover relevant\nliterature must change. Just like everybody else involved in information\ndiscovery, scholars are confronted with information overload. Two decades ago,\nthis discovery process essentially consisted of paging through abstract books,\ntalking to colleagues and librarians, and browsing journals. A time-consuming\nprocess, which could even be longer if material had to be shipped from\nelsewhere. Now much of this discovery process is mediated by online scholarly\ninformation systems. All these systems are relatively new, and all are still\nchanging. They all share a common goal: to provide their users with access to\nthe literature relevant to their specific needs. To achieve this each system\nresponds to actions by the user by displaying articles which the system judges\nrelevant to the user's current needs. Recently search systems which use\nparticularly sophisticated methodologies to recommend a few specific papers to\nthe user have been called \"recommender systems\". These methods are in line with\nthe current use of the term \"recommender system\" in computer science. We do not\nadopt this definition, rather we view systems like these as components in a\nlarger whole, which is presented by the scholarly information systems\nthemselves.

We numerically investigate the effects of early\nevolution of multiple giant planets on the orbital stability of the inner,\nsub-Neptune-like planets which are modeled as test particles, and determine\ntheir dynamically unstable region. Previous studies have shown that the\nmajority of such test particles are ejected out of the system as a result of\nclose encounters with giant planets. Here, we show that secular perturbations\nfrom giant planets can remove test particles at least down to 10 times smaller\nthan their minimum pericenter distance. Our results indicate that, unless the\ndynamical instability among giant planets is either absent or quiet like\nplanet-planet collisions, most test particles down to ~0.1 AU within the orbits\nof giant planets at a few AU may be gone. In fact, out of ~30 % of survived\ntest particles, about three quarters belong to the planet-planet collision\ncases. We find a good agreement between our numerical results and the secular\ntheory, and present a semi-analytical formula which estimates the dynamically\nunstable region of the test particles just from the evolution of giant planets.\nFinally, our numerical results agree well with the observations, and also\npredict the existence of hot rocky planets in eccentric giant planet systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 15:43:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 16:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The current\nstate-of-the-art methods work by performing recursive binary partitioning of\nthe data domains, and constructing a hierarchy of partitions. We show that the\nkey challenge in partition-based synopsis methods lies in choosing the right\npartition granularity to balance the noise error and the non-uniformity error.\nWe study the uniform-grid approach, which applies an equi-width grid of a\ncertain size over the data domain and then issues independent count queries on\nthe grid cells. This method has received no attention in the literature,\nprobably due to the fact that no good method for choosing a grid size was\nknown. Based on an analysis of the two kinds of errors, we propose a method for\nchoosing the grid size. Experimental results validate our method, and show that\nthis approach performs as well as, and often times better than, the\nstate-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a novel adaptive-grid method.\nThe adaptive grid method lays a coarse-grained grid over the dataset, and then\nfurther partitions each cell according to its noisy count. Both levels of\npartitions are then used in answering queries over the dataset. This method\nexploits the need to have finer granularity partitioning over dense regions\nand, at the same time, coarse partitioning over sparse regions. Through\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets, we show that this approach\nconsistently and significantly outperforms the uniform-grid method and other\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 15:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-07"}
