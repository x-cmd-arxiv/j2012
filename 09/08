The historically\nestablished but causally unsatisfactory solution to this problem due to Eckart\nis shown to be based on an ansatz that is interpretable as postulating a most\nunnatural relation between the (particle and entropy) velocities and their\nassociated momenta, which accounts for the well known bad behaviour of that\nmodel which has recently been shown to have very pathological\nmixed-elliptic-hyperbolic comportments. The newer (and more elegant) solution\nof Landau and Lifshitz has a more mathematically respectable\nparabolic-hyperbolic comportment, but is still compatible with a well posed\ninitial value problem only in such a restricted limit-case such as that of\nlinearised perturbations of a static background. For mathematically acceptable\nbehaviour undermore general circumstances, and a fortiori for the physically\nmotivated requirement of subluminal signal propagation, only strictly\nhyperbolic behaviour is acceptable. Attention is drawn here to the availability\nof a more modern \"regular\" solution which, is fully satisfactory as far as all\nthese requirements are concerned. This \"regular\" category of relativistic\nconducting fluid models arises naturally within a recently developed\nvariational approach, in which the traditionally important\nstress--momentum-energy density tensor is relegated to a secondary role, while\nthe relevant covariant 4-momentum co-vectors are instead brought to the fore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 16:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-10"}

In order to identify and\nto understand these phases we performed a comparative study of 21 young stellar\nclusters. Near-infrared data from 2MASS were used to determine the structural\nand fundamental parameters based on surface stellar density maps, radial\ndensity profile, and colour-magnitude diagrams.

Relations between structural and\nfundamental parameters were used to verify differences and similarities that\ncould be found among the clusters. The parameters of most of the objects have\nthe same trends or correlations. Comparisons with other young clusters show\nsimilar relations among mass, radius and density.

Although much of this material can be\nfound in various publications, a short but self-consistent summary on the topic\nhas been lacking in the hitherto literature, and we are filling the gap.\n  After these preparations, we address a popular concise formula for the tidal\ntorque, which is often used in the literature, for planets or stars.We explain\nwhy the derivation of this expression, offered in the paper by Goldreich (1966;\nAJ 71, 1 - 7) and in the books by Kaula (1968, eqn. 4.5.29), and Murray &\nDermott (1999, eqn. 4.159), implicitly sets the time lag to be frequency\nindependent. Accordingly, the ensuing expression for the torque can be applied\nonly to bodies having a very special (and very hypothetical) rheology which\nmakes the time lag frequency independent, i.e, the same for all Fourier modes\nin the spectrum of tide. This expression for the torque should not be used for\nbodies of other rheologies.

Aims: We measure\nthe MMR in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We compare our measured\nMMR to that measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and study the\ndependence of the MMR on various selection criteria to identify potential\ncauses for disparities seen in the literature. Methods: We use strong emission\nline ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. We then apply a range of\nselection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines,\nas well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in the\ninferred MMR. Results: The shape and position of the MMR can differ\nsignificantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used.\nAfter selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we find\nthat the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061< z<0.35 in GAMA is in\nreasonable agreement with that found in the SDSS despite the difference in the\nluminosity range probed. Conclusions: In view of the significant variations of\nthe MMR brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteria\nand method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the MMR from\ndifferent surveys and studies directly. We also conclude that there could be a\nmodest level of evolution over 0.06<z<0.35 within the GAMA sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We consider the case of a spherical cloud initially in\npressure equilibrium with the background. Our suite of simulations explores the\nfollowing parameters: the equation of state, radial profiles of the background\ngas, and start times for the evolution. Our primary focus is on how the fate of\nthis cloud will affect the future activity of Sgr A*. From our simulations we\nexpect an average feeding rate in the range of $5-19 \\times 10^{-8}$ solar\nmasses per year beginning in 2013 and lasting for at least 7 years (our\nsimulations stop in year 2020). The accretion varies by less than a factor of\nthree on timescales <1 month, and shows no more than a factor of 10 difference\nbetween the maximum and minimum. These rates are comparable to the current\nestimated accretion rate in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*, although they\nrepresent only a small (<5%) increase over the current expected feeding rate at\nthe effective inner boundary of our simulations. Therefore, the break up of\ncloud G2 may have only a minimal effect on the brightness and variability of\nSgr A* over the next decade. This is because current models of the galactic\ncenter predict that most of the gas will be caught up in outflows. However, if\nthe accreted G2 material can remain cold, it may not mix well with the hot,\ndiffuse background gas, and instead accrete efficiently onto Sgr A*. Further\nobservations of G2 will give us an unprecedented opportunity to test this idea.\nThe break up of the cloud itself may also be observable. By tracking the amount\nof cloud energy that is dissipated during our simulations, we are able to get a\nrough estimate of the luminosity associated with its tidal disruption; we find\nvalues of a few $10^{36}$ erg/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 20:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 20:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Based on a\ncareful study of their Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), which has been\nparametrized using a 2-component (AGN+galaxy) model fit, we derived\ndust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colors, stellar masses and star formation\nrates (SFRs). We find that AGN hosts span a large range of stellar masses and\nSFRs. No color-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the AGN hosts, which are\nfound to be mainly massive, red galaxies. Once accounting for the color-mass\ndegeneracy in well defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual marginal\nenhancement of AGN incidence in redder galaxies with lower specific star\nformation rates, and we argue that this result might emerge because of our\nability to properly account for AGN light contamination and dust extinction.\nInterestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black hole\ngrowing at any given \"specific accretion rate\" (i.e. the ratio of X-ray\nluminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxy\nmass, while it decreases as a power-law with Lx/M. By analyzing the\nnormalization of such probability distribution, we show how the incidence of\nAGN increases with redshift as rapidly as (1+z)^4, in close resemblance with\nthe overall evolution of the specific star formation rate of the entire galaxy\npopulation. Although AGN activity and star formation in galaxies do appear to\nhave a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within the\nCOSMOS sample we do not find strong evidence of any 'smoking gun' signaling\npowerful AGN influence on the star-forming properties of their hosts galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 20:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

With an energy\nresolution of 11 eV FWHM below 1 keV, the spectrum's observed line ratios help\nseparate charge exchange contributions originating within the heliosphere from\nthermal emission of hot gas in the interstellar medium. The X-ray sensitivity\nbelow 1 keV was reduced by about a factor of four from contamination that\noccurred early in the flight, limiting the significance of the results. The\nobserved centroid of helium-like O VII is 568+2-3 eV at 90% confidence. Since\nthe centroid expected for thermal emission is 568.4 eV while for charge\nexchange is 564.2 eV, thermal emission appears to dominate for this line\ncomplex, consistent with much of the high-latitude O VII emission originating\nin 2-3 x 10^6 K gas in the Galactic halo.

In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding\n`scores' for each object (e.g. player's rating) is of interest for\nunderstanding the intensity of the preferences.\n  In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation\nalgorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pair-wise\ncomparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the\ngraph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are\ncompared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to\nbe its stationary probability under this random walk. To study the efficacy of\nthe algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model\n(equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pair-wise comparisons) in which\neach object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes\nof pair-wise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pair-wise marginal\nprobabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the\nBTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the\nscores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. In\nparticular, the number of samples required to learn the score well with high\nprobability depends on the structure of the comparison graph. When the\nLaplacian of the comparison graph has a strictly positive spectral gap, e.g.\neach item is compared to a subset of randomly chosen items, this leads to\ndependence on the number of samples that is nearly order-optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2012 04:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 06:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 21:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 17:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

Based on the information commonly known to all the\ncontrollers, the decentralized problem is reformulated as an equivalent\ncentralized problem from the perspective of a coordinator. The coordinator\nknows the common information and select prescriptions that map each\ncontroller's local information to its control actions. The optimal control\nproblem at the coordinator is shown to be a partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP) which is solved using techniques from Markov decision\ntheory. This approach provides (a) structural results for optimal strategies,\nand (b) a dynamic program for obtaining optimal strategies for all controllers\nin the original decentralized problem.

In practice, general equilibrium\ntreats economies as being always in equilibrium, albeit in a sequence of\nequilibria as driven by external changes in parameters. This view is sometimes\ndefended on the grounds that internal dynamics are fast, while external changes\nare slow, so that the economy can be viewed as adjusting instantaneously to any\nchanged conditions. However, the argument has not been presented in a rigorous\nway. In this paper we show that when conditions are such that: a) economies do\nrespond essentially instantaneously to external influences; b) the external\nchanges are small compared to the values that characterize the economy; and c)\nthe economy's dynamics are continuous and first-order in time (as for Walrasian\ntatonnement), the resulting economic theory is equivalent to a topological\nfield theory. Because it is a topological theory it has no dynamics in a strict\nsense, and so perturbatively---that is, when examining dynamics in the region\nof a critical point---the field theory behaves as general equilibrium posits.\nHowever, the field-theoretic form of the theory admits non-perturbative\ninstanton solutions that link different critical points. Thus, in this theory,\nand in contrast to general equilibrium, the internal dynamics of the model\noccasionally make an appearance in the form of abrupt, noise-driven transitions\nbetween critical points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2012 11:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

A follow-up Suzaku observation on January 28 recorded\nenhanced persistent emission both in soft and hard X-rays (Enoto et al. 2010b).\nThrough re-analysis of the same Suzaku data, 18 short bursts were identified in\nthe X-ray events recorded by the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) and the X-ray\nImaging Spectrometer (XIS). Their spectral peaks appear in the HXD-PIN band,\nand their 10-70 keV X-ray fluences range from ~2e-9 erg cm-2 to 1e-7 erg cm-2.\nThus, the 18 events define a significantly weaker burst sample than was ever\nobtained, ~1e-8-1e-4 erg cm-2. In the ~0.8 to ~300 keV band, the spectra of the\nthree brightest bursts can be represented successfully by a two-blackbody\nmodel, or a few alternative ones. A spectrum constructed by stacking 13 weaker\nshort bursts with fluences in the range (0.2-2)e-8 erg s-1 is less curved, and\nits ratio to the persistent emission spectrum becomes constant at ~170 above ~8\nkeV. As a result, the two-blackbody model was able to reproduce the stacked\nweaker-burst spectrum only after adding a power-law model, of which the photon\nindex is fixed at 1.54 as measured is the persistent spectrum. These results\nimply a possibility that the spectrum composition employing an optically-thick\ncomponent and a hard power-law component can describe wide-band spectra of both\nthe persistent and weak-burst emissions, despite a difference of their fluxes\nby two orders of magnitude.

In this paper we examine the bandit problem\nunder the weaker assumption that the distributions have moments of order\n1+\\epsilon, for some $\\epsilon \\in (0,1]$. Surprisingly, moments of order 2\n(i.e., finite variance) are sufficient to obtain regret bounds of the same\norder as under sub-Gaussian reward distributions. In order to achieve such\nregret, we define sampling strategies based on refined estimators of the mean\nsuch as the truncated empirical mean, Catoni's M-estimator, and the\nmedian-of-means estimator. We also derive matching lower bounds that also show\nthat the best achievable regret deteriorates when \\epsilon <1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2012 15:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}
