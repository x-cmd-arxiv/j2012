In the case of diffeomorphism groups, this approach gives a new\ninterpretation of recently derived singular peakon solutions of Diff(R)-strand\nequations, and allows for the construction of singular solutions (such as\nfilaments or sheets) for a more general class of equations, called covariant\nEPDiff equations.

The Hamiltonian of the\nsystem includes: (i) the exchange interaction $J_{ij}$ between nearest-neighbor\nsites $i$ and $j$ (ii) the long-range dipolar interaction of amplitude $D$\ntruncated at a cutoff distance $r_c$ (iii) a single-ion perpendicular\nanisotropy of amplitude $A$.

A von Neumann\ncategory is a premonoidal category with compatible dagger structure which\nembeds as a double commutant into a suitable premonoidal category of Hilbert\nspaces.\n  The notion was inspired by algebraic quantum field theory. In AQFT, one\nassigns to open regions in Minkowski space a C*-algebra, called the local\nalgebra. The local algebras are patched together to form a global algebra\nassociated to the AQFT. The key relativistic assumption is Einstein Causality,\nwhich says that the algebras associated to spacelike separated regions commute\nin the global algebra. Premonoidal categories provide a natural framework for\nlifting such structure from algebras to categories. Thus von Neumann categories\nserve as a basis for extending the abstract quantum mechanics of Abramsky and\nCoecke to include relativistic effects.\n  In this paper, we focus on the structure of von Neumann categories. After\ngiving the basic definitions and examples, we consider constructions typically\nassociated to von Neumann algebras, and examine their extensions to the\ncategory setting.

The availability of the S.\ncerevisiae genome led to many insights into its five known transposable element\nfamilies (Ty1-Ty5) in the years shortly after its completion. However,\nsubsequent advances in bioinformatics tools for analysing transposable elements\nand the recent availability of genome sequences for multiple strains and\nspecies of yeast motivates new investigations into Ty evolution in S.\ncerevisiae. Here we provide a comprehensive phylogenetic and population genetic\nanalysis of Ty families in S. cerevisiae based on a reannotation of Ty elements\nin the S288c reference genome. We show that previous annotation efforts have\nunderestimated the total copy number of Ty elements for all known families. In\naddition, we identify a new family of Ty3-like elements related to the S.\nparadoxus Ty3p which is composed entirely of degenerate solo LTRs. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of LTR sequences identified three families with short-branch, recently\nactive clades nested among long branch, inactive insertions (Ty1, Ty3, Ty4),\none family with essentially all recently active elements (Ty2) and two families\nwith only inactive elements (Ty3p and Ty5). Population genomic data from 38\nadditional strains of S. cerevisiae show that elements present in active clades\nare predominantly polymorphic, whereas most of the inactive elements are fixed.\nFinally, we use comparative genomic data to provide evidence that the Ty2 and\nTy3p families have arisen in the S. cerevisiae genome by horizontal transfer.\nOur results demonstrate that the genome of a single individual contains\nimportant information about the state of TE population dynamics within a\nspecies and suggest that horizontal transfer may play an important role in\nshaping the diversity of transposable elements in unicellular eukaryotes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2012 19:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-05"}

By requiring\nfurther that these two Hamiltonians be in fact identical up to an overall shift\nin energy, a periodic structure is installed in the hierarchy of quantum\nsystems which should allow for its solution. Specific classes of orthogonal\npolynomials characteristic of such periodic hierarchies are thereby generated,\nwhile the methods of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics then lead to generalised\nRodrigues formulae and recursion relations for such polynomials. The approach\nalso offers the practical prospect of quantum modelling through the engineering\nof quantum potentials from experimental energy spectra. In this paper these\nideas are presented and solved explicitly for the cases N=1 and N=2. The latter\ncase is related to the generalised Laguerre polynomials, for which indeed new\nresults are thereby obtained. At the same time new classes of integrable\nquantum potentials which generalise that of the harmonic oscillator and which\nare characterised by two arbitrary energy gaps are identified, for which a\ncomplete solution is achieved algebraically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2012 15:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
