We focus on dilatons that arise from theories of technicolor, or from\ntheories of the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), that involve\nstrong conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet. In the pNGB case, we are\nconsidering a framework where the Higgs particle is significantly heavier than\nthe dilaton and has therefore not yet been observed. In each of the technicolor\nand pNGB scenarios, we study both the case when the SM fermions and gauge\nbosons are elementary, and the case when they are composites of the strongly\ninteracting sector. Our analysis incorporates conformal symmetry violating\neffects, which are necessarily present since the dilaton is not massless, and\nis directly applicable to a broad class of models that stabilize the weak scale\nand involve strong conformal dynamics. Since the AdS/CFT correspondence relates\nthe radion in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models to the dilaton, our results also\napply to RS models with the SM fields localized on the infrared brane, or in\nthe bulk. We identify the parameters that can be used to distinguish the\ndilatons associated with the several different classes of theories being\nconsidered from each other, and from the SM Higgs.

However, one question remains: Does glycerol modulate water\npermeation? This study answers this fundamental question by determining the\nchemical-potential profile of glycerol along the permeation path through GlpF's\nconducting pore. There is a deep well near the Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs\n(dissociation constant 14 microM) and a barrier near the selectivity filter\n(10.1 kcal/mol above the well bottom). This profile owes its existence to\nGlpF's perfect steric arrangement: The glycerol-protein van der Waals\ninteractions are attractive near the NPA but repulsive elsewhere in the\nconducting pore. In light of the single-file nature of waters and glycerols\nlining up in GlpF's amphipathic pore, it leads to the following conclusion:\nGlycerol modulates water permeation in the microM range. At mM concentrations,\nGlpF is glycerol-saturated and a glycerol dwelling in the well occludes the\nconducting pore. Therefore, water permeation is fully correlated to glycerol\ndissociation that has an Arrhenius activation barrier of 6.5 kcal/mol.\nValidation of this theory is based on the existent in vitro data, some of which\nhave not been given the proper attention they deserved: The Arrhenius\nactivation barriers were found to be 7 kcal/mol for water permeation and 9.6\nkcal/mol for glycerol permeation; The presence of up to 100 mM glycerol did not\naffect the kinetics of water transport with very low permeability, in apparent\ncontradiction with the existent theories that predicted high permeability (0 M\nglycerol).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 17:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-19"}

These results suggest an intrinsic pumping mechanism\nfor translocation across cell walls which could arise whenever the fluid across\nthe membrane is inhomogeneous. Somewhat surprisingly, the sign of the preferred\ndirection of translocation is found to be strongly dependent on the simulation\nalgorithm: for Langevin Dynamics (LD) simulations, a bias towards the low\nviscosity side is found while for Brownian Dynamics (BD), a bias towards the\nhigh viscosity is found. Examining the translocation dynamics in detail across\na wide range of viscosity gradients and developing a simple force model to\nestimate the magnitude of the bias, the LD results are demonstrated to be more\nphysically realistic. The LD results are also compared to those generated from\na simple, one dimensional random walk model of translocation to investigate the\nrole of the internal degrees of freedom of the polymer and the entropic\nbarrier. To conclude, the scaling of the results across different polymer\nlengths demonstrates the saturation of the preferential direction with polymer\nlength and the non-trivial location of the maximum in the exponent\ncorresponding to the scaling of the translocation time with polymer length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 18:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

I conclude that we need to adopt a qualitatively\ndifferent approach to dealing with interferometric data. I note that some good\nwork is being done on this front, but it is likely a bigger effort is needed in\nthe SKA era.

One hypothesis is that\nswarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes\nconfusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this\nselective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we\nshow that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve\nswarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary\neffect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the\nstructure of the predator's visual field, favoring the frontally oriented,\nhigh-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on\nswarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming\nin response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the\nfunctional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey\ndensity increases. Thus, we show that a relatively simple perceptual\nconstraint--predator confusion--could have pervasive evolutionary effects on\nprey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and the ecological interactions\nbetween predators and prey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 21:31:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2013 00:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 19:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Data chunks and associated data processing pipelines are\nscheduled across cluster nodes using a demand driven approach, while within a\nnode operations in a given pipeline instance are scheduled across CPUs and\nGPUs. The runtime system implements several optimizations, including\nperformance aware task scheduling, architecture aware process placement, data\nlocality conscious task assignment, and data prefetching and asynchronous data\ncopy, to maximize utilization of the aggregate computing power of CPUs and GPUs\nand minimize data copy overheads.

Hybrid automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) is one\nof the techniques to make such improvement possible. However, this advancement\nis reduced at the cell edge where interference is not negligible. In order to\novercome the challenge at the cell edge, the concept of interference-aware\nreceiver has been recently proposed in which both desired and interference\nsignals are successively decoded, called interference-aware successive decoding\n(IASD). Although IASD is the advanced receiver technology, interference signals\nare out of the mobile station's control so that they cannot be requested by the\nmobile station. For this reason, this paper proposes new combining schemes for\nthe IASD receiver, which operate with hybrid ARQ in a bit level or in a symbol\nlevel. In addition, this paper compares the memory requirement among the\nproposed combining schemes and analyzes the impact of discrete modulation on\nthe proposed scheme. Simulation results presents the superiority of the\nproposed combining schemes and shows the improvement in terms of the number of\ntransmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 00:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

The TD game is a two-person game. Each player can select an integer\nvalue between $R$ and $M$ ($R < M$) as a pure strategy. If both of them select\nthe same value, the payoff to them will be that value. If the players select\ndifferent values, say $i$ and $j$ ($R \\le i < j \\le M$), then the payoff to the\nplayer who chooses the small value will be $i+R$ and the payoff to the other\nplayer will be $i-R$. We term the player who selects a large value as the\ncooperator, and the one who chooses a small value as the defector. The reason\nis that if both of them select large values, it will result in a large total\npayoff. The Nash equilibrium of the TD game is to choose the smallest value\n$R$. However, in previous behavioral studies, players in TD game typically\nselect values that are much larger than $R$, and the average selected value\nexhibits an inverse relationship with $R$. To explain such anomalous behavior,\nin this paper, we study the evolution of cooperation in spatial traveler's\ndilemma game where the players are located on a square lattice and each player\nplays TD games with his neighbors. Players in our model can adopt their\nneighbors' strategies following two standard models of spatial game dynamics.\nMonte-Carlo simulation is applied to our model, and the results show that the\ncooperation level of the system, which is proportional to the average value of\nthe strategies, decreases with increasing $R$ until $R$ is greater than the\nthreshold where cooperation vanishes. Our findings indicate that spatial\nreciprocity promotes the evolution of cooperation in TD game and the spatial TD\ngame model can interpret the anomalous behavior observed in previous behavioral\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 01:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In particular, when the spin-orbit coupling increases and one of the\nsplit Fermi surfaces disappears, the phase diagram and the structure of the gap\nfunction change drastically. For example, we examine the conditions for the\ntransition from full-gap states to line-node states (FLT), which may explain\nthe differences in the experimental results between the noncentrosymmetric\nsuperconductors Li2Pd3B and Li2Pt3B discovered recently. The dominant pairing\ninteractions and gap functions can be predicted to some extent by comparing the\ntheoretical and experimental results for these compounds. For example, if the\nFLT occurs by replacing Pd with Pt, it is most likely that the\nsuperconductivity is mainly induced by charge-charge interactions, and if this\nis the case, the superconductivities in Li2Pd3B and Li2Pt3B are an s-wave\nnearly spin-triplet state and a d-wave state that has both spin-singlet and\ntriplet components of comparable weights, respectively. Comparing the\ntheoretical phase diagrams in simple models, it is found that the FLT occurs in\na wider realistic parameter region for charge-charge interactions, i.e., where\nshort-range Coulomb repulsion is strong and p-wave and d-wave interactions are\nattractive, while it occurs in narrower rather unrealistic parameter regions\nfor interactions of magnetic origin.

Two typical features of the\nobservations are that the oscillations are damped in time and that simultaneous\nmass flows along the threads are detected. Flows cause the dense threads to\nmove along the prominence magnetic structure while the threads are oscillating.\nThe oscillations have been interpreted in terms of standing magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) kink waves of the magnetic flux tubes which support the threads. The\ndamping is most likely due to resonant absorption caused by plasma\ninhomogeneity. The technique of seismology uses the observations combined with\nMHD wave theory to estimate prominence physical parameters. This paper presents\na theoretical study of the joint effect of flow and resonant absorption on the\namplitude of standing kink waves in prominence threads. We find that flow and\nresonant absorption can either be competing effects on the amplitude or both\ncan contribute to damp the oscillations depending on the instantaneous position\nof the thread within the prominence magnetic structure. The amplitude profile\ndeviates from the classic exponential profile of resonantly damped kink waves\nin static flux tubes. Flow also introduces a progressive shift of the\noscillation period compared to the static case, although this effect is in\ngeneral of minor importance. We test the robustness of seismological estimates\nby using synthetic data aiming to mimic real observations. The effect of the\nthread flow can significantly affect the estimation of the transverse\ninhomogeneity length scale. The presence of random background noise adds\nuncertainty to this estimation. Caution needs to be paid to the seismological\nestimates that do not take the influence of flow into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 09:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Both the stock price\nmovement and the investors' global behavior are found to be closely related to\nthe phase region they fall into. Within the region where the market impact is\nsmall, investors' asymmetric response to gains and losses leads to the\noccurrence of herd behavior, when all the investors are prone to behave\nsimilarly in an extreme way and large price fluctuations occur. A linear\nrelation between the standard deviation of stock price changes and the mean\nvalue of strategies is found. With full market impact, the investors tend to\nself-segregate into opposing groups and the introduction of asymmetric\nsensitivity leads to the disappearance of dominant strategies.

Prior work has identified many\nbehavioral, molecular biological and single neuron changes throughout the\nmesocorticolimbic system that reflect and drive addictive behavior.\nSubpopulations in the ventral tegemental area (VTA) encode positive reward\nprediction error, negative reward prediction error, and the magnitude of the\nreward. Phasic activity in VTA dopaminergic neurons correlates with hedonic\nvalue. Tonic activity of groups in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)\ncan encode antidepressant states. However, little is known about how drug\naddiction might affect population encoding across larger brain regions. Here,\nwe compare the information content associated with network patterns in naive,\nacutely intoxicated and chronically addicted states in a plastic attractor\nnetwork. We found that addiction decreases the network's ability to store and\ndiscriminate among patterns of activity. Altered dopaminergic tone flattens the\nenergy landscape and decreases the entropy associated with each network\npattern. Altered dmPFC activity produces signal-to-noise deficits similar to\ncomputational models of schizophrenia. Our results provide a conceptual\nframework for interpreting altered neural population dynamics in\npsychopathological states based on information theory. They also suggest a view\nof the subtypes of depression as on a continuum of combinations of cortical and\nsubcortical dysfunction. This suggests that patients who suffer from depression\nwith psychotic features will have more cortical than mesolimbic dysfunction.\nFurthermore, our framework can be applied to other psychiatric illnesses and so\nmay help us, in general, quantitatively understand psychiatric illnesses as\ndisorders in the representation and processing of information by distributed\nbrain networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 14:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

Recent observations by Hinode/SOT showed that the\nspicules mostly exhibit upward propagating high frequency waves. Here we\ninvestigate the dissipation of such waves due to phase mixing in stratified\nenvironment of solar spicules. Since they are highly dynamic structures with\nspeeds at about significant fractions of the Alfven phase speed, we take into\naccount the effects of steady flows. Our numerical simulations show that in the\npresence of stratification due to gravity, damping takes place in space than in\ntime. The exponential damping low, exp(-At^3), is valid under spicule\nconditions, however the calculated damping time is much longer than the\nreported spicule lifetimes from observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2012 14:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-02"}
