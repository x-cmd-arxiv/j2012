We present spectral models\nbased on different density profiles, corresponding to different explosion\nscenarios, and discuss their consistency. First, we use a density structure of\na simulated explosion of a 2 M_sun rotating C-O white dwarf (WD), which is\noften proposed as a possibility to explain SC SNe Ia.

Finally, we calculate spectra assuming an interaction\nscenario. In such a scenario, SN 2009dc would be a standard WD explosion with a\nnormal intrinsic luminosity, and this luminosity would be augmented by\ninteraction of the ejecta with a H-/He-poor circumstellar medium.

The\nionizing emissivity must have been larger at earlier times in order to yield\nthe extended reionization history implied by the electron scattering optical\ndepth constraint from WMAP. Here we address the possibility that a faint\npopulation of galaxies with host halo masses of ~1e8-1e9 Msun dominated the\nionizing photon budget at redshifts of about z>9, due to their much higher\nescape fractions. Such faint, early galaxies, would not have formed in ionized\nregions due to suppression by heating from the UV background (UVB), and would\ntherefore not contribute to the ionizing background at z<6, after reionization\nis complete.

The interchange process is\noften thought to develop at the apex of streamers or pseudo-streamers, near Y\nand X-type neutral points, but slow streams with loop composition have been\nrecently observed along fanlike open field lines adjacent to closed regions,\nfar from the apex. However, coronal heating models, with magnetic field lines\nshuffled by convective motions, show that reconnection can occur continuously\nin unipolar magnetic field regions with no neutral points: photospheric motions\ninduce a magnetohydrodynamic turbulent cascade in the coronal field that\ncreates the necessary small scales, where a sheared magnetic field component\northogonal to the strong axial field is created locally and can reconnect. We\npropose that a similar mechanism operates near and around boundaries between\nopen and closed regions inducing a continual stochastic rearrangement of\nconnectivity. We examine a reduced magnetohydrodynamic model of a simplified\ninterface region between open and closed corona threaded by a strong unipolar\nmagnetic field. This boundary is not stationary, becomes fractal, and field\nlines change connectivity continuously, becoming alternatively open and closed.\nThis model suggests that slow wind may originate everywhere along loop-coronal\nhole boundary regions, and can account naturally and simply for outflows at and\nadjacent to such boundaries and for the observed diffusion of slow wind around\nthe heliospheric current sheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In the clean case, a reweighting technique is combined with a\ncareful extrapolation of the data to infinite time to determine with high\naccuracy the critical behavior in the three-dimensional directed percolation\nuniversality class. In the presence of quenched spatial disorder, our data\ndemonstrate that the absorbing-state transition is governed by an\nunconventional infinite-randomness critical point featuring activated dynamical\nscaling. The critical behavior of this transition does not depend on the\ndisorder strength, i.e., it is universal. Close to the disordered critical\npoint, the dynamics is characterized by the nonuniversal power laws typical of\na Griffiths phase.

This allows for significant savings both in the downlink\ntraining and in the CSIT feedback from the user terminals to the base station,\nthus making the use of a large number of base station antennas potentially\nsuitable also for Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems, for which\nuplink/downlink channel reciprocity cannot be exploited.

However, the advent of WFC3-IR made it possible to do slitless\ninfrared spectroscopic surveys over an area significant for galaxy evolution\nstudies (~0.15 deg^2). Slitless infrared spectroscopy is uniquely possible from\nspace due to the reduced background. Redshift surveys with WFC3-IR offer probes\nof the astrophysics of the galaxy population at z=1-3 from line features, and\nthe true redshift and spatial distribution of galaxies, that cannot be done\nwith photometric surveys alone. While HST slitless spectroscopy is low spectral\nresolution, its high multiplex advantage makes it competitive with future\nground based IR spectrographs, its flux calibration is stable, and its high\nspatial resolution allows measuring the spatial extent of emission lines, which\nonly HST can do currently for large numbers of objects.

These are often referred to as \"penguin pollution\" (PP)\nbecause their inclusion in the amplitude leads to a theoretical error in the\nextraction of 2beta_s from the data.

Ultraviolet properties include the\ncontinuum shape, emission-line measurements of C IV, Al III, C III], Fe II, and\nMg II, and BAL properties including the balnicity index (BI), absorption index\n(AI), and minimum and maximum outflow velocities. We find that radio-loud BAL\nquasars have similar ultraviolet properties compared to radio-loud non-BAL\nsources, though they do appear to have redder continua and stronger Fe II\nemission, which is consistent with what is found for radio-quiet BAL sources.\nNo correlations exist between outflow properties and orientation (radio\nspectral index), suggesting that BAL winds along any line of sight are driven\nby the same mechanisms. There are also few correlations between spectral index\nand other properties. We conclude that BAL outflows occur along all lines of\nsight with similar strengths and velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 21:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

It is first shown that the optimum distributed\npower control policy is in the form of a threshold based water-filling power\ncontrol. Each secondary user executes the derived power control policy in a\ndistributed fashion by using local knowledge of its direct and interference\nchannel gains such that the resulting aggregate (average) interference does not\ndisrupt primary's communication. Then, the tight sum-rate scaling laws are\nderived as a function of the number of secondary users $N$ under the optimum\ndistributed power control policy. The fading models considered to derive\nsum-rate scaling laws are general enough to include Rayleigh, Rician and\nNakagami fading models as special cases. When transmissions of secondary users\nare limited by both transmission and interference power constraints, it is\nshown that the secondary network sum-rate scales according to\n$\\frac{1}{\\e{}n_h}\\log\\logp{N}$, where $n_h$ is a parameter obtained from the\ndistribution of direct channel power gains.

Some assessments seem consistent with a diverse RNA world, yet\ndirect continuity between modern RNAs and an RNA world has not been\ndemonstrated for the majority of RNA families, and, anecdotally, many RNA\nfunctions appear restricted in their distribution. Despite much discussion of\nthe possible antiquity of RNA families, no systematic analyses of RNA family\ndistribution have been performed. To chart the broad evolutionary history of\nknown RNA families, we performed comparative genomic analysis of over 3 million\nRNA annotations spanning 1446 families from the Rfam 10 database.

The possibility to coherently control\nthis real-space shift with temporally non-overlapping excitation pulses allows\nfor the observation of a new type of shift current, which only exists for\ncertain polarization-shaped excitation pulses and vanishes in the\ncontinuous-wave limit. In contrast to previously studied shift currents, the\nnew current requires a phase mismatch between two orthogonal transition dipole\nmoments and leads, within a nonlinear second-order description, to a tensor\nwhich is antisymmetric with respect to the order of the two exciting electric\nfield amplitudes. These observations, which can even be made at room\ntemperature and are expected to occur in a variety of semiconductor crystal\nclasses, contribute to a better understanding of light-matter interaction\ninvolving degenerate bands. Thus, they are expected to prove important for\nfuture studies of coherent and nonlinear optical effects in semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 09:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-14"}

The NAT antidote adds entropy to DNS requests by switching the\nresolver's IP address to a random address (belonging to the same autonomous\nsystem).

To estimate the rest-frame afterglow brightness as a function of\ntime, we use a combination of the optical VRI photometry obtained by the\nRAPTOR-T telescope array -- which are presented in this paper -- and Swift's\nX-Ray Telescope observations. Excitation alone, which has been successfully\napplied for a handful of other GRBs, fails to describe the observed\ncolumn-density evolution in the case of GRB 080310. Inclusion of ionization is\nrequired to explain the column-density decrease of all observed FeII levels\n(including the ground state 6D9/2) and increase of the FeIII 7S3 level. The\nlarge population of ions in this latter level (up to 10% of all FeIII) can only\nbe explained through ionization of FeII, whereby a large fraction of the\nionized FeII ions -- we calculate 31% using the Flexible Atomic (FAC) and Cowan\ncodes -- initially populate the 7S3 level of FeIII rather than the ground\nstate. This channel for producing a significant FeIII 7S3 level population may\nbe relevant for other objects in which absorption lines from this level -- the\nUV34 triplet -- are observed, such as BAL quasars and Eta Carinae. This\nprovides conclusive evidence for time-variable ionization in the circumburst\nmedium, which to date has not been convincingly detected. However, the best-fit\ndistance of the neutral absorbing cloud to the GRB is 200--400 pc, i.e. similar\nto GRB-absorber distance estimates for GRBs without any evidence for\nionization. We find that the presence of time-varying ionization in GRB 080310\nis likely due to a combination of the super-solar iron abundance ([Fe/H]=+0.2)\nand the low HI column density (log N(HI)=18.7).

Thick discs truncate less often (31%), but when they do, their break\nradius is comparable with that in the thin disc. This suggests either two\ndifferent truncation mechanisms - one of dynamical origin affecting both discs\nsimultaneously and another one only affecting the thin disc - or a single\nmechanism that creates a truncation in one disc or in both depending on some\ngalaxy property. Thin discs apparently antitruncate in around 40% of galaxies.\nHowever, in many cases, these antitruncations are an artifact caused by the\nsuperposition of a thin disc and a thick disc with the latter having a longer\nscale length.

However, due to the lack of direct written accounts and the\nscarcity of inscriptions we do not have a clear knowledge on the precise nature\nof such believes and how these reflected on the calendar or the religious\ntime-keeping system of this ancient society. A statistical analysis of the\norientation of their sacred monuments demonstrates that astronomical\norientations were often part of an elaborated plan and possibly a trace of the\nastral nature of Nabataean religion. Petra and other monuments in the ancient\nNabataean kingdom have proven to be marvellous laboratories of the interaction\nbetween landscape features and astronomical events showing impressive\nhierophanies on particular monuments related to cultic times and worships.\nAmong other findings, the famous Ad Deir has shown a fascinating ensemble of\nlight and shadow effects, perhaps connected with the bulk of Nabataean\nmythology, while from the impressive Urn tomb, a series of suggestive\nsolstitial and equinoctial alignments emanate which might have lately helped\nits selection as the cathedral of the city. This paper demonstrates that the\nsky was a substantial element on Nabataean religion and reveals new evidence\nfor cultic worship centred on the celestial sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 13:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-10"}

In this Letter, an optimization procedure is\nused to simultaneously address two fundamental questions of dynamo theory:\n\"Which velocity field leads to the most magnetic energy growth?\" and \"How large\ndoes the velocity need to be relative to magnetic diffusion?\" In general, this\nrequires optimization over the full space of continuous solenoidal velocity\nfields possible within the geometry. Here the case of a periodic box is\nconsidered. Measuring the strength of the flow with the root-mean-square\namplitude, an optimal velocity field is shown to exist, but without limitation\non the strain rate, optimization is prone to divergence. Measuring the flow in\nterms of its associated dissipation leads to the identification of a single\noptimal at the critical magnetic Reynolds number necessary for a dynamo. This\nmagnetic Reynolds number is found to be only 15% higher than that necessary for\ntransient growth of the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 14:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 10:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The\nobservations were carried out with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. The CH\nemission is found to be extended over the whole region of HCL2. It is brighter\nin the southeastern part, which encloses the TMC-1 cyanopolyyne peak than in\nthe northwestern part. Its distribution extends continuously from the peak of\nthe neutral carbon emission (CI peak) to the TMC-1 ridge, as if it were\nconnecting the distributions of the [C I] and C$^{18}$O emissions. Since CH is\nan intermediate in gas-phase chemical reactions from C to CO, its emission\nshould trace the transition region. The above distribution of the CH emission\nis consistent with this chemical behavior. Since the CH abundance is subject to\nthe chemical evolutionary effect, the CH column density in HCL2 no longer\nfollows a linear correlation wit the H$_2$ column density reported for diffuse\nand translucent clouds. More importantly, the CH line profile is found to be\ncomposed of the narrow and broad components. Although the broad component is\ndominant around the CI peak, the narrow component appears in the TMC-1 ridge\nand dense core regions such as L1527 and TMC-1A.

Now that its arc-length is 8,154 days and has been observed for more\nthan 20 years, a more robust classification should be possible. Here we explore\nthe orbital behaviour of this object in order to reveal its current dynamical\nstatus; we perform N-body simulations in both directions of time to investigate\nthe evolution of its orbital elements. In particular, we study the librational\nproperties of the mean longitude that currently librates around the value of\nthe mean longitude of Neptune with an amplitude of nearly 50 degrees and a\nperiod of about 7,500 years. Our calculations show that it has been in its\npresent dynamical state for about 12,500 years and it will stay there for\nanother 12,500 years. Therefore, its current state is relatively short-lived.\nDue to its chaotic behaviour, the object may have remained in the 1:1 mean\nmotion resonance with Neptune for several 100,000 years at most, undergoing\ntransitions between the various resonant states. (309239) 2007 RW10 is\ncurrently a quasi-satellite, the first object of this dynamical class to be\ndiscovered around Neptune. With a diameter of about 250 km, it is the largest\nknown co-orbital in the Solar System. Its significant eccentricity (0.30) and\norbital inclination (36 degrees), strongly suggest that it did not form in situ\nbut was captured, likely from beyond Neptune. With an apparent magnitude of\n21.1 at opposition (October), it is well suited for spectroscopic observations\nthat may provide information on its surface composition and hence eventually\nits origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 15:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

A\nself-adaptive system is seen as composed by two levels: the lower level\ndescribing the actual behaviour of the system and the upper level accounting\nfor the dynamically changing environmental constraints on the system. In order\nto keep our description as general as possible, the lower level is modelled as\na state machine and the upper level as a second-order state machine whose\nstates have associated formulas over observable variables of the lower level.\nThus, each state of the second-order machine identifies the set of lower-level\nstates satisfying the constraints. Adaptation is triggered when a second-order\ntransition is performed; this means that the current system no longer can\nsatisfy the current high-level constraints and, thus, it has to adapt its\nbehaviour by reaching a state that meets the new constraints. The semantics of\nthe multi-level system is given by a flattened transition system that can be\nstatically checked in order to prove the correctness of the adaptation model.\nTo this aim we formalize two concepts of weak and strong adaptability providing\nboth a relational and a logical characterization. We report that this work\ngives a formal computational characterization of multi-level self-adaptive\nsystems, evidencing the important role that (theoretical) computer science\ncould play in the emerging science of complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 01:41:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2013 21:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}
