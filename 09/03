They are constructed from regular\nsecondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-strands that are joined\ntogether by loops. Here we develop a visualization technique that is adapted to\ndescribe this modular structure. In complement to the widely employed\nRamachandran plot that is based on toroidal geometry, our approach utilizes the\ngeometry of a two-sphere. Unlike the more conventional approaches that only\ndescribea given peptide unit, ours is capable of describing the entire backbone\nenvironment including the neighboring peptide units. It maps the positions of\neach atom to the surface of the two-sphere exactly how these atoms are seen by\nan observer who is located at the position of the central C-alpha atom. At each\nlevel of side-chain atoms we observe a strong correlation between the\npositioning of the atom and the underlying local secondary structure with very\nlittle if any variation between the different amino acids. As a concrete\nexample we analyze the left-handed helix region of non-glycyl amino acids. This\nregion corresponds to an isolated and highly localized residue independent\nsector in the direction of the C-beta carbons on the two-sphere. We show that\nthe residue independent localization extends to C-gamma and C-delta carbons,\nand to side-chain oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the case of asparagine and\naspartic acid. When we extend the analysis to the side-chain atoms of the\nneighboring residues, we observe that left-handed beta-turns display a regular\nand largely amino acid independent structure that can extend to seven\nconsecutive residues. This collective pattern is duu to the presence of a\nbackbone soliton. We show how one can use our visualization techniques to\nanalyze and classify the different solitons in terms of selection rules that we\ndescribe in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2012 19:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Dark matter self-annihilation can lead to a high luminosity\nin gamma rays and neutrinos, enhanced by a strong degree of clustering in dark\nmatter substructures. Hadronic CR interactions can also lead to a high\nluminosity in gamma rays and neutrinos, enhanced by the confinement of CRs from\ncluster accretion/merger shocks and active galactic nuclei. We show that\nIceCube/KM3Net observations of high-energy neutrinos can probe the nature of\nGCs and the separate dark matter and CR emission processes, taking into account\nhow the results depend on the still-substantial uncertainties. Neutrino\nobservations are relevant at high energies, especially at >10 TeV. Our results\nshould be useful for improving experimental searches for high-energy neutrino\nemission. Neutrino telescopes are sensitive to extended sources formed by dark\nmatter substructures and CRs distributed over large scales. Recent observations\nby Fermi and imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes have placed interesting\nconstraints on the gamma-ray emission from GCs. We also provide calculations of\nthe gamma-ray fluxes, taking into account electromagnetic cascades inside GCs,\nwhich can be important for injections at sufficiently high energies. This also\nallows us to extend previous gamma-ray constraints to very high dark matter\nmasses and significant CR injections at very high energies. Using both\nneutrinos and gamma rays, which can lead to comparable constraints, will allow\nmore complete understandings of GCs. Neutrinos are essential for some dark\nmatter annihilation channels, and for hadronic instead of electronic CRs. Our\nresults suggest that the multi-messenger observations of GCs will be able to\ngive useful constraints on specific models of dark matter and CRs.

We consider a market in which there is a monopolistic resource\nprovider and agents that enter and exit the market following a random process.\nSelf-interested and fully rational agents dynamically update their resource\nconsumption decisions over a finite time horizon, under the constraint that the\ntotal resource consumption requirements are met before each individual's\ndeadline. We then compare the statistics of the stationary aggregate demand\nprocesses induced by the non-cooperative and cooperative load scheduling\nschemes. We show that although the non-cooperative load scheduling scheme leads\nto an efficiency loss - widely known as the \"price of anarchy\" - the stationary\ndistribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail.\nThis tail, which corresponds to rare and undesirable demand spikes, is\nimportant in many applications of interest. On the other hand, when the agents\ncan cooperate with each other in optimizing their total cost, a higher market\nefficiency is achieved at the cost of a higher probability of demand spikes.

AC susceptibility\nmeasurements have been carried out for SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 sample at various\namplitude and frequencies of applied AC drive field. The inter-granular\ncritical current density (Jc) is estimated. Specific heat [Cp(T)] measurement\nshowed an anomaly at around 140K due to the SDW ordering of Fe, followed by\nanother peak at 5K corresponding to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of\nSm+3 ions in SmFeAsO compound.

The derived luminosity distributions are normalised to the\nSDSS DR7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per cent\nlevel. The data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution\n(CSED) from 0.1 to 2.1 \\mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variance\nfor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. The two populations\nexhibit dramatically different CSEDs as expected for a predominantly old and\nyoung population respectively. Using the Driver et al. (2008) prescription for\nthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals are\ncorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined CSED constructed.\nThe final results show that the Universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)\nx 10^{35} h W Mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h W Mpc^{-3} is\ndirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h\nW Mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-IR. Using the GAMA\ndata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-IR emission which agrees\nremarkably well with available data. We therefore provide a robust description\nof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby Universe from\n0.1micron to 0.6mm. The largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the mid\nand far-IR bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and its\ncurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, and\nmorphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 07:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The observations were performed with\nInfrared Camera (IRC) aboard the AKARI satellite. At the energy range 7000 K <=\nE(v,J) <= 20000 K, the shocked H2 gas in IC 443 shows an ortho-to-para ratio\n(OPR) of 2.4+0.3-0.2, which is significantly lower than the equilibrium value\n3, suggesting the existence of non-equilibrium OPR. The shocked gas in HB 21\nalso indicates a potential non-equilibrium OPR in the range of 1.8-2.0. The\nlevel populations are well described by the power-law thermal admixture model\nwith a single OPR, where the temperature integration range is 1000-4000 K. We\nconclude that the obtained non-equilibrium OPR probably originates from the\nreformed H2 gas of dissociative J-shocks, considering several factors such as\nthe shock combination requirement, the line ratios, and the possibility that H2\ngas can form on grains with a non-equilibrium OPR. We also investigate C-shocks\nand partially-dissociative J-shocks for the origin of the non-equilibrium OPR.\nHowever, we find that they are incompatible with the observed ionic emission\nlines for which dissociative J-shocks are required to explain. The difference\nin the collision energy of H atoms on grain surfaces would make the observed\ndifference between the OPRs of IC 443 and HB 21, if dissociative J-shocks are\nresponsible for the H2 emission.

Concerning the neutron star\ncrust-core phase transition at zero and finite temperature, it will be shown\nthat, as a consequence of the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, the\nequivalence of statistical ensembles is violated and a clusterized phase is\nexpected which is not accessible in the grand-canonical ensemble.

We set out to obtain a better understanding\nof $h_2$. Its mysterious piece is a polynomial in $2|S|$ variables. Our main\ntheorem states that this polynomial is quadratic, and gives a procedure for\nwriting its coefficients in terms of $p$-adic logarithms and dilogarithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 09:03:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 13:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

Recently, high-resolution large-scale mappings of mid- and higher-J CO\nemissions have been reported toward the Orion molecular cloud 1 core region\nusing the APEX telescope. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate this\noutflow in the higher-J 12CO emission, which is likely excited by shocks. The\nobservations were carried out using the dual-color heterodyne array CHAMP+ on\nthe APEX telescope. The images of the Orion BN/KL region were obtained in the\n12CO J=6-5 and J=7-6 transitions with angular resolutions of 8.6 and 7.4\narcsec, respectively. The results show a good agreement between our higher-J\n12CO emission and SMA low-J 12CO data, which indicates that this wide-angle\noutflow in Orion BN/KL is likely the result of an explosive event that is\nrelated to the runaway objects from a dynamically decayed multiple system. From\nour observations, we estimate that the kinetic energy of this explosive outflow\nis about 1-2x10^47 erg. In addition, a scenario has been proposed where part of\nthe outflow is decelerated and absorbed in the cloud to explain the lack of CO\nbullets in the southern part of BN/KL, which in turn induces the methanol\nmasers seen in this region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 09:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}

We aim to determine\nthe abundance and distribution of H2O, its kinematics and the physical\nconditions of the gas responsible for the H2O emission.

The H2O emission originates\nin a region where temperatures are comparable to that of the warm H2 gas\n(T\\gtrsim200K). Thus, the H2O emission traces a gas component significantly\nwarmer than the gas responsible for the low-J CO emission.

A classical example in microeconomics considers the\nconsumer demand function as a function of the price of goods and the income,\nboth variables often considered as endogenous. In this framework, the economic\ntheory also imposes shape restrictions on the demand function, like\nintegrability conditions. Motivated by this illustration in microeconomics, we\nstudy an estimator of a nonparametric constrained regression function using\ninstrumental variables by means of Tikhonov regularization. We derive rates of\nconvergence for the regularized model both in a deterministic and stochastic\nsetting under the assumption that the true regression function satisfies a\nprojected source condition including, because of the non-convexity of the\nimposed constraints, an additional smallness condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 11:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

To estimate the dust content, we use the disk opacity as\ninferred from the number of distant galaxies identified in twelve HST/WFPC2\nfields of ten nearby spiral galaxies. The observed number of distant galaxies\nis calibrated for source confusion and crowding with artificial galaxy counts\nand here we verify our results with sub-mm surface brightnesses from archival\nHerschel-SPIRE data. We find that the opacity of the spiral disk does not\ncorrelate well with the surface density of atomic (Hi) or molecular hydrogen\n(H2) alone implying that dust is not only associated with the molecular clouds\nbut also the diffuse atomic disk in these galaxies. Our result is a typical\ndust-to-gas ratio of 0.04, with some evidence that this ratio declines with\ngalactocentric radius, consistent with recent Herschel results. We discuss the\npossible causes of this high dust-to-gas ratio; an over-estimate of the dust\nsurface-density, an under-estimate of the molecular hydrogen density from CO\nmaps or a combination of both. We note that while our value of the mean\ndust-to-gas ratio is high, it is consistent with the metallicity at the\nmeasured radii if one assumes the Pilyugin & Thuan calibration of gas\nmetallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 11:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Multi agent system\ntechnology in recent times has emerged as a possible way of efficient solution\nimplementation for many such complex problems. Our research here focuses on\nbuilding a Multi Agent System (MAS), which implements a modified version of\nGravitational Search swarm intelligence Algorithm (GSA) to find out an optimal\nstrategy in managing the demand supply chain. We target the grains distribution\nsystem among various centers of Food Corporation of India (FCI) as application\ndomain.

Applying Newtonian law of gravity as suggested in GSA, larger\nobjects attract objects of smaller mass towards itself, creating a virtual\ngrain supply source. As heavier object sheds its mass by supplying some to the\none in demand, it loses its gravitational pull and thus keeps the whole system\nof supply chain per-fectly in balance. The multi agent system helps in\ncontinuous updation of the whole system with the help of autonomous agents\nwhich react to the change in environment and act accordingly. This model also\nreduces the communication bottleneck to greater extents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 11:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}

Contrary to previous mechanisms described\nregulating homeostasis, which involve competition for the same niche by cells\nhaving overlapping survival requirements, homeostasis of the innate\nIgM-secreting B cell pool is also achieved when B cells populations are able to\nmonitor the number of activated B cells by detecting their secreted products.\nNotably, B cell populations are able to assess the density of activated B cells\nby sensing their secreted IgG. This process involves the Fc{\\gamma}RIIB, a\nlow-affinity IgG receptor that is expressed on B cells and acts as a negative\nregulator of B cell activation, and its intracellular effector the inositol\nphosphatase SHIP. As a result of the engagement of this inhibitory pathway the\nnumber of activated IgM-secreting B cells is kept under control.

For a wide\nvariety of spreading processes, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix\nof the network plays a key role on their global dynamical behavior. For many\nreal-world large-scale networks, it is unfeasible to exactly retrieve the\ncomplete network structure to compute its largest eigenvalue. Instead, one\nusually have access to myopic, egocentric views of the network structure, also\ncalled egonets. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework, based on\nalgebraic graph theory and convex optimization, to study how local structural\nproperties of the network constrain the interval of possible values in which\nthe largest eigenvalue must lie. Based on this framework, we present a\ncomputationally efficient approach to find this interval from a collection of\negonets.

After considering\nvarious other possible scenarios, we show that this extended emission in\nCircinus is most likely caused by a jet-driven outflow, which is driving shells\nof strongly shocked gas into the halo of the host galaxy. In this context, we\nestimate Mach numbers M=2.7-3.6 and M=2.8-5.3 for the W and E shells\nrespectively.

We estimate\nthat the total energy (thermal and kinetic) involved in creating both shells is\n~2x10^55 erg, and their age is ~10^6 years. Comparing these results with those\nwe previously obtained for Centaurus A, NGC 3801 and Mrk 6, we show that these\nparameters scale approximately with the radio power of the parent AGN. The\nspatial coincidence between the X-ray and edge-brightened radio emission in\nCircinus resembles the morphology of some SNR shocks.

We investigate what\nunderlying mechanisms both types of systems may have in common, arguing that,\nin Circinus, the edge-brightening in the shells may be accounted for by a B\nfield enhancement caused by shock compression, but do not preclude some local\nparticle acceleration.

In particular,\nimplications of the delocalization-localization transition for the fractal\ndimension of the eigenvectors, for the distribution function of the eigenvector\ncomponents, and for the nearest neighbor spacing statistics of the eigenphases\nare examined. On the one hand, our results further indicate that a PRBUM\nensemble can serve as a unitary analog of the power-law random Hermitian matrix\nmodel for Anderson transition. On the other hand, some statistical features\nunseen before are found from PRBUM. For example, the dependence of the fractal\ndimension of the eigenvectors of PRBUM upon one ensemble parameter displays\nfeatures that are quite different from that for the power-law random Hermitian\nmatrix model. Furthermore, in the time-reversal symmetric case the nearest\nneighbor spacing distribution of PRBUM eigenphases is found to obey a\nsemi-Poisson distribution for a broad range, but display an anomalous level\nrepulsion in the absence of time-reversal symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 14:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In contrast, sextet fermion mass deformations of spectral properties are\nnot consistent with leading conformal scaling behavior near the critical\nsurface of a conformal theory. A recent paper could not resolve the conformal\nfixed point of the gauge coupling from the slowly walking scenario of a very\nsmall nearly vanishing \\beta-function (DeGrand:2012yq). It is argued that\noverall consistency with our new results is resolved if the sextet model is\nclose to the conformal window, staying outside with a very small non-vanishing\n\\beta-function. The model would exhibit then the simplest composite Higgs\nmechanism leaving open the possibility of a light scalar state with quantum\nnumbers of the Higgs impostor. It would emerge as the pseudo-Goldstone dilaton\nstate from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance.

Understanding the origin of these\nevents is arguably one of the most important problems in economic theory. In\nthis paper, we review recent efforts to include heterogeneities and\ninteractions in models of decision. We argue that the Random Field Ising model\n(RFIM) indeed provides a unifying framework to account for many collective\nsocio-economic phenomena that lead to sudden ruptures and crises. We discuss\ndifferent models that can capture potentially destabilising self-referential\nfeedback loops, induced either by herding, i.e. reference to peers, or\ntrending, i.e. reference to the past, and account for some of the phenomenology\nmissing in the standard models. We discuss some empirically testable\npredictions of these models, for example robust signatures of RFIM-like herding\neffects, or the logarithmic decay of spatial correlations of voting patterns.\nOne of the most striking result, inspired by statistical physics methods, is\nthat Adam Smith's invisible hand can badly fail at solving simple coordination\nproblems. We also insist on the issue of time-scales, that can be extremely\nlong in some cases, and prevent socially optimal equilibria to be reached. As a\ntheoretical challenge, the study of so-called \"detailed-balance\" violating\ndecision rules is needed to decide whether conclusions based on current models\n(that all assume detailed-balance) are indeed robust and generic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Sep 2012 16:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2012 15:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Its\nlysogenic and lytic life cycles echo competition between the DNA binding\n$\\lambda$-repressor (CI) and CRO proteins. Here we scrutinize the structure,\nstability and folding pathways of the $\\lambda$-repressor protein, that\ncontrols the transition from the lysogenic to the lytic state. We first\ninvestigate the super-secondary helix-loop-helix composition of its backbone.\nWe use a discrete Frenet framing to resolve the backbone spectrum in terms of\nbond and torsion angles. Instead of four, there appears to be seven individual\nloops. We model the putative loops using an explicit soliton Ansatz. It is\nbased on the standard soliton profile of the continuum nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. The accuracy of the Ansatz far exceeds the B-factor fluctuation\ndistance accuracy of the experimentally determined protein configuration. We\nthen investigate the folding pathways and dynamics of the $\\lambda$-repressor\nprotein.

We conclude that folding is\ndominated by the temporal ordering of soliton formation. In particular, the\nthird soliton should appear before the first and second.
