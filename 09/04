We find that the WL does not provide a strong constraint on the MR,\nallowing for more than a factor of 10 freedom in the subhalo mass of central\ngalaxies, for a given stellar mass.

Our analysis relies on a novel framework to study perturbations of rotating\nKerr black holes in the slow-rotation regime, that we developed up to second\norder in rotation, and that can be extended to other spacetime metrics and\nother theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 20:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 06:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Linear stability calculations\nare presented for radially structured, vertically stratified,\ngeometrically-thin disks with non-uniform entropy distribution in both\ndirections.

On 2011\nDecember 14 a gamma-ray source positionally consistent with PKS 2123-463 was\ndetected in flaring activity by Fermi-LAT. This activity triggered\nradio-to-X-ray observations by the Swift, GROND, ATCA, Ceduna, and KAT-7\nobservatories. Results of the localization of the gamma-ray source over 41\nmonths of Fermi-LAT operation are reported here in conjunction with the results\nof the analysis of radio, optical, UV and X-ray data collected soon after the\ngamma-ray flare.\n  The strict spatial association with the lower energy counterpart together\nwith a simultaneous increase of the activity in optical, UV, X-ray and\ngamma-ray bands led to a firm identification of the gamma-ray source with PKS\n2123-463. A new photometric redshift has been estimated as z = 1.46+/-0.05\nusing GROND and Swift/UVOT observations, in rough agreement with the disputed\nspectroscopic redshift of z = 1.67. We fit the broadband spectral energy\ndistribution with a synchrotron/external Compton model. We find that a thermal\ndisk component is necessary to explain the optical/UV emission detected by\nSwift/UVOT. This disk has a luminosity of about 1.8x10^46 erg/s, and a fit to\nthe disk emission assuming a Schwarzschild (i.e., nonrotating) black hole gives\na mass of about 2x10^9 solar masses.

Conventionally, this problem is overcome by the use of\nion-gating structures. This method, however, introduces large dead times and\nrestricts trigger rates to a few hundred per second. The ion gate can be\neliminated from the setup by the use of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils for\ngas amplification, which intrinsically suppress the backflow of ions. This\nmakes the continuous operation of a TPC at high rates feasible.\n  In this work, Monte Carlo simulations of the buildup of ion space charge in a\nGEM-based TPC and the correction of the resulting drift distortions are\ndiscussed, based on realistic numbers for the ion backflow in a triple-GEM\namplification stack. A TPC in the future PANDA experiment at FAIR, in which\nantiproton-proton interaction rates up to 2 x 10^7 per second will be reached,\nserves as an example for the experimental environment. The simulations show\nthat space charge densities up to 65 fC per cubic cm are reached, leading to\nelectron drift distortions of up to 10 mm.

Much biological theory in this area\nis based on Ronald Fisher's work, who used Euclidean geometry to study the\nrelation between mutation size and expected fitness of the offspring in\ninfinite phenotypic spaces. Here we reconsider this theory based on the\nalternative geometry of discrete and finite spaces of DNA sequences. First, we\nconsider the geometric case of fitness being isomorphic to distance from an\noptimum, and show how problems of optimal mutation rate control can be solved\nexactly or approximately depending on additional constraints of the problem.\nThen we consider the general case of fitness communicating only partial\ninformation about the distance. We define weak monotonicity of fitness\nlandscapes and prove that this property holds in all landscapes that are\ncontinuous and open at the optimum. This theoretical result motivates our\nhypothesis that optimal mutation rate functions in such landscapes will\nincrease when fitness decreases in some neighbourhood of an optimum, resembling\nthe control functions derived in the geometric case. We test this hypothesis\nexperimentally by analysing approximately optimal mutation rate control\nfunctions in 115 complete landscapes of binding scores between DNA sequences\nand transcription factors. Our findings support the hypothesis and find that\nthe increase of mutation rate is more rapid in landscapes that are less\nmonotonic (more rugged). We discuss the relevance of these findings to living\norganisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 02:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 17:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

An anti-correlation between variability and\nrest-frame wavelength is found. The variability amplitude of radio-quiet\nquasars shows almost no cosmological evolution, but that of radio-loud ones may\nweakly anti-correlate with redshift. In addition, variability increases as\neither luminosity or Eddington ratio decreases. However, the relationship\nbetween variability and black hole mass is uncertain; it is negative when the\ninfluence of Eddington ratio is excluded, but positive when the influence of\nluminosity is excluded. The intrinsic distribution of variability amplitudes\nfor radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars are different. Both radio-loud and\nradio-quiet quasars exhibit a bluer-when-brighter chromatism. Assuming that\nquasar variability is caused by variations of accretion rate, the\nShakura-Sunyaev disk model can reproduce the tendencies of observed\ncorrelations between variability and rest-frame wavelength, luminosity as well\nas Eddington ratio, supporting that changes of accretion rate plays an\nimportant role in producing the observed optical variability.

Due to the same convection term of the Boltzmann equation\nand the Vlasov equation, it is very convenient to use the moment expansion in\nthe NRxx method to approximate the distribution function in the Vlasov\nequations. The moment closure recently presented in [5] is applied to achieve\nthe globally hyperbolicity so that the local well-posedness of the moment\nsystem is attained. This makes our simulations using high order moment\nexpansion accessible in the case of the distribution far away from the\nequilibrium which appears very often in the solution of the Vlasov equations.\nWith the moment expansion of the distribution function, the acceleration in the\nvelocity space results in an ordinary differential system of the macroscopic\nvelocity, thus is easy to be handled. The numerical method we developed can\nkeep both the mass and the momentum conserved. We carry out the simulations of\nboth the Vlasov-Poisson equations and the Vlasov-Poisson-BGK equations to study\nthe linear Landau damping. The numerical convergence is exhibited in terms of\nthe moment number and the spatial grid size, respectively. The variation of\ndiscretized energy as well as the dependence of the recurrence time on moment\norder is investigated. The linear Landau damping is well captured for different\nwave numbers and collision frequencies. We find that the Landau damping rate\nlinearly and monotonically converges in the spatial grid size.

However, the detection of $\\gamma$-rays\nabove 8 TeV during the flare challenges this model due to the hardness of the\nspectra.

We define a purely discrete\nplug-in estimator of the distribution function which locally converges at rate\nn^{1/3} and derive its (normal) limit distribution. Unlike the MLE or SMLE,\nthis estimator is not a proper distribution function. Since the estimator is\npurely discrete, it demonstrates that the n^{1/3} convergence rate is in\nprinciple possible for the MLE, but whether this actually holds for the MLE is\nstill an open problem. If the cube root n rate holds for the MLE, this would\nmean that the local 1-dimensional rate of the MLE continues to hold in\ndimension 2, a (perhaps) somewhat surprising result. The simulation results do\nnot seem to be in contradiction with this assumption, however. We compare the\nbehavior of the plug-in estimator with the behavior of the MLE on a sieve and\nthe SMLE in a simulation study. This indicates that the plug-in estimator and\nthe SMLE have a smaller variance but a larger bias than the sieved MLE. The\nSMLE is conjectured to have a n^{1/3}-rate of convergence if we use bandwidths\nof order n^{-1/6}. We derive its (normal) limit distribution, using this\nassumption.

In particular, we propose AntMesh, a distributed\ninterference-aware data forwarding algorithm which enables the use of smart\nants to probabilistically and concurrently perform the routing and data\nforwarding in order to stochastically solve a dynamic network routing problem.\nAntMesh belongs to the class of routing algorithms inspired by the behaviour of\nreal ants which are known to find a shortest path between their nest and a food\nsource. In addition, AntMesh has the capability to effectively utilize the\nspace/channel diversity typically common in multi radio WMNs and to discover\nhigh throughput paths with less inter-flow and intra-flow interference while\nconventional wireless network routing protocols fail to do so. We implement our\nsmart ant-based routing algorithm in ns-2 and carry out extensive evaluation.\nWe demonstrate the stability of AntMesh in terms of how quickly it adapts\nitself to the changing dynamics or load on the network. We tune the parameters\nof AntMesh algorithm to study the effect on its performance in terms of the\nrouting load and end-to-end delay and have tested its performance under various\nnetwork scenarios particularly fixed nodes mesh networks and also on mobile WMN\nscenarios. The results obtained show AntMesh's advantages that make it a\nvaluable candidate to operate in mesh networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 07:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-05"}

Venus\ntransits have traditionally provided unique insight into the Venus atmosphere\nthrough the refraction halo that appears at the planet outer terminator near\ningress/egress. Much more recently, Venus transits have attracted renewed\ninterest because the technique of transits is being successfully applied to the\ncharacterization of extrasolar planet atmospheres. The current work\ninvestigates theoretically the interaction of sunlight and the Venus atmosphere\nthrough the full range of transit phases, as observed from Earth and from a\nremote distance. Our model predictions quantify the relevant atmospheric\nphenomena, thereby assisting the observers of the event in the interpretation\nof measurements and the extrapolation to the exoplanet case. Our approach\nrelies on the numerical integration of the radiative transfer equation, and\nincludes refraction, multiple scattering, atmospheric extinction and solar limb\ndarkening, as well as an up to date description of the Venus atmosphere. We\nproduce synthetic images of the planet terminator during ingress/egress that\ndemonstrate the evolving shape, brightness and chromaticity of the halo.\nGuidelines are offered for the investigation of the planet upper haze from\nvertically-unresolved photometric measurements. In this respect, the comparison\nwith measurements from the 2004 transit appears encouraging.

The\ncomparison of the model predictions to those for a Venus-like planet free of\nhaze and clouds (and therefore a closer terrestrial analogue) complements the\ndiscussion and sets the conclusions into a broader perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 08:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Despite the popularity of this idea,\na conclusive proof for its validity is still missing. Gamma-ray astronomy\nprovides us with a powerful tool to tackle this problem, because gamma rays are\nproduced during cosmic ray interactions with the ambient gas. The detection of\ngamma rays from several supernova remnants is encouraging, but still does not\nconstitute a proof of the scenario, the main problem being the difficulty in\ndisentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the emission. Once\nreleased by their sources, cosmic rays diffuse in the interstellar medium, and\nfinally escape from the Galaxy. The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the\nGalactic disk, as well as the gamma-ray emission detected from a few galaxies\nis largely due to the interactions of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium.\nOn much larger scales, cosmic rays are also expected to permeate the\nintracluster medium, since they can be confined and accumulated within clusters\nof galaxies for cosmological times. Thus, the detection of gamma rays from\nclusters of galaxies, or even upper limits on their emission, will allow us to\nconstrain the cosmic ray output of the sources they contain, such as normal\ngalaxies, AGNs, and cosmological shocks.

Along with orbital changes,\ngalaxies in clusters are well known to undergo severe alteration in their\nhot/cold gas content and star formation properties. Understanding the link\nbetween the changes in the internal properties of galaxies and their orbital\nmotion is of crucial importance in the study of galaxy evolution, as it could\nunveil the primary mechanism responsible for its environmental dependence. Do\nthe changes in the internal properties happen in parallel with those in the\norbital motion? Or are the orbital features at the time of infall what\ndetermines the fate of the member galaxies? Alternatively: are the properties\nof galaxies at a given time related to the coeval orbital anisotropy or are\nthey better related to the anisotropy at infall? In order to answer these\nquestions, we studied the orbital evolution of different galaxy populations in\nthe semi-analytic models of Guo et al. (2011) applied on to the Millennium\nSimulation. For each class of objects, characterised by different internal\nproperties (such as age, star formation rate and colour), we studied the\nanisotropy profile at redshift zero and its evolution by tracing the\nprogenitors back in time. We conclude that the orbital properties at infall\nstrongly influence the subsequent evolution of the internal features of\ngalaxies and that the overall anisotropy of the galaxy population tends to\nincrease with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 10:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Our new approach is an extension of the\nprevious studies that employ spherically symmetric, steady, shocked accretion\nflows together with the light bulb approximation.

In the present approach, on the\nother hand, we get rid of the steady-state condition and take into account\nshock wave motions instead.

After confirming that the new\napproach indeed captures the dynamics of revived shock wave qualitatively, we\nthen apply the method to various initial conditions and find that there is a\ncritical fluctuation for shock revival, which can be well fit by the following\nformula: f_crit ~ 0.8 * (M_in/1.4M_sun) * {1- (rsh/10^8cm)}, in which fcrit\ndenotes the critical pressure fluctuation normalized by the unperturbed\npost-shock value.

The planets invoked in that work were\nsignificantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually\ncrossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong\ngravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a\nhighly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we\nconsider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery\nwork. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we\nfind that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot\nexist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole\nparameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational\ndata on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit\nto the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more\nwidely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and\nyields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty\nin the orbit of the outermost body. Despite this, a detailed dynamical analysis\nof this new solution similarly reveals that it also requires the planets to\nmove on orbits that are simply not dynamically feasible. Our results imply that\nsome mechanism other than the influence of planetary companions must be the\nprincipal cause of the observed eclipse timing variations for HW Vir. If the\nsys- tem does host exoplanets, they must move on orbits differing greatly from\nthose previously proposed.

The\nmodel was formulated as a linear programming problem and solved using widely\navailable optimization software. The solution indicates that temperatures have\ngone up by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the 55 years covered by the data. It\nalso correctly identifies the known phase of the solar cycle; i.e., the date of\nthe last solar minimum. It turns out that the maximum slope of the solar cycle\nsinusoid in the regression model is about the same size as the slope produced\nby the linear trend. The fact that the solar cycle was correctly extracted by\nthe model is a strong indicator that effects of this size, in particular the\nslope of the linear trend, can be accurately determined from the 55 years of\ndata analyzed.\n  The main purpose for doing this analysis is to demonstrate that it is easy to\nfind and analyze archived temperature data for oneself.

The event gave rise to a two-week long burst of >100MeV gamma-rays\ndetected by Fermi/LAT, a unique observation testifying to particle acceleration\nin the system. The outburst can be considered a scaled-down supernova, with\nshort dynamical time scale, and thus can constitute a test case for theories of\nthe origin of galactic cosmic rays. We aim at determining the properties of the\naccelerated particles and identifying the origin of the high-energy radiation.\nWe developed a model for diffusive shock acceleration and non-thermal emission\nin V407 Cyg, complemented by an evaluation of the thermal emission from the\nshocked plasma. We considered both leptonic and hadronic contributions to the\nnon-thermal processes, and investigated the effect of many binary and nova\nparameters. The gamma-ray emission is mostly of leptonic origin and arises\npredominantly from inverse-Compton scattering of the nova light. Upscattering\nof the red giant photons is a minor contribution. Matching the light curve\nrequires gas accumulation in the vicinity of the white dwarf, as a consequence\nof wind accretion, while the spectrum imposes particle scattering close to the\nBohm limit in the upstream equipartition magnetic field. The nova accelerated\nprotons (respectively electrons) with energies up to ~300GeV (respectively\n~20GeV), for a total non-thermal energy 10^43 erg after two weeks, representing\n~10% of the initial nova kinetic energy. The electron-to-proton ratio at\ninjection is 6%. The V407 Cyg eruption can be understood from the same\nprinciples that are invoked for particle acceleration in supernova remnants,\nalthough without the need for strong magnetic field amplification. The\npopulation of novae in symbiotic systems is a negligible source of Galactic\ncosmic rays, and most likely not a class of TeV-emitters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 12:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 08:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

After\n~79 days in V344 Lyrae, the disk angular momentum L_d becomes misaligned to the\norbital angular momentum L_o. As the gas stream remains normal to L_o,\nhydrodynamics (e.g., the lift force) is a likely source to disk tilt. In\naddition to tilt, the outer disk annuli cyclically change shape from circular\nto highly eccentric due to tidal torques by the secondary star.

The lone existing approach is limited by\ndifficult computation and the requirement that the spatial dependence be\nrepresented on a lattice, making this method inappropriate for areal models\nwith irregular structures that often arise in ecology, epidemiology, and the\nsocial sciences. Here we present a novel method for spatial variable selection\nin areal generalized linear models that can accommodate arbitrary spatial\nstructures and works with a broad subset of GLM likelihoods. The method uses a\nlatent probit model with a spatial dependence structure where the binary\nresponse is taken as a covariate inclusion indicator for area-specific GLMs.\nThe covariate inclusion indicators arise via thresholding of latent standard\nnormals on which we place a conditionally autoregressive prior.

However, in systems with\nstrong electron-electron and electron-phonon correlations it is unclear what\nphysics will dominate the photoresponse. Here we investigate photocurrent in a\nvanadium dioxide, an exemplary strongly correlated material known for its\ndramatic metal-insulator transition (MIT) at Tc = 68 C which could be useful\nfor optoelectronic detection and switching up to ultraviolet wavelengths. Using\nscanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) on individual suspended VO2 nanobeams\nwe observe photoresponse peaked at the metal-insulator boundary but extended\nthroughout both insulating and metallic phases. We determine that the response\nis photo-thermal, implying efficient carrier relaxation to a local equilibrium\nin a manner consistent with strong correlations. Temperature dependent\nmeasurements reveal subtle phase changes within the insulating state. We\nfurther demonstrate switching of the photocurrent by optical control of the\nmetal-insulator boundary arrangement. Our work shows the value of SPCM applied\nto nanoscale crystals for investigating strongly correlated materials, and the\nresults are relevant for designing and controlling optoelectronic devices\nemploying such materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 15:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 04:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-06"}

An efficient way to identify these systems is through their\ninfrared excess. Most studies so far concentrated on early-type or solar-type\nstars, but less effort has gone into investigating M dwarfs.\n  We characterize the mid-infrared photometric behavior of M dwarfs and search\nfor infrared excess in nearby M dwarfs taken from the volume-limited RECONS\nsample using data from the WISE satellite and the 2MASS catalog. Our sample\nconsists of 85 sources encompassing 103 M dwarfs. We derive empirical infrared\ncolors from these data and discuss their errors. Based on this, we check the\nstars for infrared excess and discuss the minimum excess we would be able to\ndetect.\n  Other than the M8.5 dwarf SCR 1845-6357 A, where the excess is produced by a\nknown T6 companion, we detect no excesses in any of our sample stars. The\nlimits we derive for the 22um excess are slightly higher than the usual\ndetection limit of 10-15% for Spitzer studies, but including the [12]-[22]\ncolor in our analysis allows us to derive tight constraints on the fractional\ndust luminosity L_dust/L_star. We show that this result is consistent with M\ndwarf excesses in the mid-inrared being as frequent as excesses around\nearlier-type stars. The low detection rate could be an age effect. We also\npresent a tentative excess detection at 22um around the known cold debris disk\nM dwarf AU Mic, which is not part of our statistical sample.\n  There is still no clear detection of a mid-infrared excess around any old\n(>30 Myr) main-sequence M dwarf. It is unclear whether this is due to a\ndifferent dust evolution around M dwarfs or whether this is an age effect\ncombined with the diffculties involved in searching M dwarfs for infrared\nexcesses. A significantly larger sample of well-studied M dwarfs is required to\nsolve this question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 15:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 12:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
