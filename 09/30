Although molecular phylogenetics has begun to disentangle major\nevolutionary relationships within this vast section of the Tree of Life, there\nis no widely available approach for efficiently collecting phylogenomic data\nwithin fishes, leaving much of the enormous potential of massively parallel\nsequencing technologies for resolving major radiations in ray-finned fishes\nunrealized. Here, we provide a genomic perspective on longstanding questions\nregarding the diversification of major groups of ray-finned fishes through\ntargeted enrichment of ultraconserved nuclear DNA elements (UCEs) and their\nflanking sequence. Our workflow efficiently and economically generates data\nsets that are orders of magnitude larger than those produced by traditional\napproaches and is well-suited to working with museum specimens. Analysis of the\nUCE data set recovers a well-supported phylogeny at both shallow and deep\ntime-scales that supports a monophyletic relationship between Amia and\nLepisosteus (Holostei) and reveals elopomorphs and then osteoglossomorphs to be\nthe earliest diverging teleost lineages. Divergence time estimation based upon\n14 fossil calibrations reveals that crown teleosts appeared ~270 Ma at the end\nof the Permian and that elopomorphs, osteoglossomorphs, ostarioclupeomorphs,\nand euteleosts diverged from one another by 205 Ma during the Triassic. Our\napproach additionally reveals that sequence capture of UCE regions and their\nflanking sequence offers enormous potential for resolving phylogenetic\nrelationships within ray-finned fishes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 16:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-20"}

Due to the entirely different\nscaling behavior of the noise and the solar magnetic pattern it has been\npossible to determine the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise distribution\nand remove the noise contribution from the average unsigned flux density for\nthe whole 15-yr SOHO/MDI data set and for a selection of SDO/HMI magnetograms.\nThere is a very close correlation between the MDI disk-averaged unsigned\nvertical flux density and the sunspot number, and regression analysis gives a\nresidual level of 2.7 G when the sunspot number is zero. The selected set of\nHMI magnetograms, which spans the most quiet phase of solar activity, has a\nlower limit of 3.0 G to the noise-corrected average flux density. These\napparently cycle-independent levels may be identified as a basal flux density,\nwhich represents an upper limit to the possible flux contribution from a local\ndynamo, but not evidence for its existence. The 3.0 G HMI level, when scaled to\nthe Hinode spatial resolution, translates to 3.5 G, which means that the much\nhigher average flux densities always found by Hinode in quiet regions do not\noriginate from a local dynamo. The contributions to the average unsigned flux\ndensity come almost exclusively from the extended wings of the probability\ndensity function (PDF), also in the case of HMI magnetograms with only\nbasal-level magnetic flux. These wings represent intermittent magnetic flux.\nWhile the global dynamo appears to dominate the magnetic energy spectrum at all\nthe resolved spatial scales, there are indications from the observed Hanle\ndepolarization in atomic lines that the local dynamo may dominate the spectrum\nat scales of order 1-10 km and below.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 16:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In short, RIP\ninvolves estimating the singular values of a combinatorially large number of\nsubmatrices, seemingly requiring an enormous amount of computation in even\nlow-dimensional examples. In this paper, we consider a similar problem\ninvolving submatrix singular value estimation, namely the problem of explicitly\nconstructing numerically erasure robust frames (NERFs). Such frames are the\nlatest invention in a long line of research concerning the design of linear\nencoders that are robust against data loss. We begin by focusing on a subtle\ndifference between the definition of a NERF and that of an RIP matrix, one that\nallows us to introduce a new computational trick for quickly estimating NERF\nbounds. In short, we estimate these bounds by evaluating the frame analysis\noperator at every point of an epsilon-net for the unit sphere. We then borrow\nideas from the theory of group frames to construct explicit frames and\nepsilon-nets with such high degrees of symmetry that the requisite number of\noperator evaluations is greatly reduced. We conclude with numerical results,\nusing these new ideas to quickly produce decent estimates of NERF bounds which\nwould otherwise take an eternity. Though the more important RIP problem remains\nopen, this work nevertheless demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting\nsymmetry to greatly reduce the computational burden of similar combinatorial\nlinear algebra problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 18:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-02"}

In quantum magnetic systems,\nfrustration arises naturally from competing spin-spin interactions given by the\ngeometry of the spin lattice or by the presence of long-range antiferromagnetic\ncouplings. Frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such\nas quantum spin liquids, spin glasses and spin ices, whose ground states are\nmassively degenerate and can carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. The\ncontrolled study of frustrated magnetism in materials is hampered by short\ndynamical time scales and the presence of impurities, while numerical modeling\nis generally intractable when dealing with dynamics beyond N~30 particles.\nAlternatively, a quantum simulator can be exploited to directly engineer\nprescribed frustrated interactions between controlled quantum systems, and\nseveral small-scale experiments have moved in this direction. In this article,\nwe perform a quantum simulation of a long-range antiferromagnetic quantum Ising\nmodel with a transverse field, on a crystal of up to N = 16 trapped Yb+ atoms.\nWe directly control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range\nof interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their\ndynamics through spatially-resolved spin detection.

Constraining the maximum mutual-information (MMI)\nquantization to enforce a constant-ratio constraint provides a significant\nsimplification with no noticeable loss in performance.\n  Our simulation results suggest that for a well-designed LDPC code, the\nquantization that maximizes the mutual information will also minimize the frame\nerror rate.

By extending a formalism previously applied\nto inflation, we consider the metric universally coupled to matter fields and\nwe write in terms of it the most general unitary gauge action consistent with\nthe residual unbroken symmetries of spatial diffeomorphisms. Our action is\nparticularly suited for cosmological perturbation theory: the background\nevolution depends on only three operators. All other operators start at least\nat quadratic order in the perturbations and their effects can be studied\nindependently and systematically. In particular, we focus on the properties of\na few operators which appear in non-minimally coupled scalar-tensor gravity and\ngalileon theories. In this context, we study the mixing between gravity and the\nscalar degree of freedom. We assess the quantum and classical stability, derive\nthe speed of sound of fluctuations and the renormalization of the Newton\nconstant. The scalar can always be de-mixed from gravity at quadratic order in\nthe perturbations, but not necessarily through a conformal rescaling of the\nmetric. We show how to express covariant field-operators in our formalism and\ngive several explicit examples of dark energy and modified gravity models in\nour language. Finally, we discuss the relation with the covariant EFT methods\nrecently appeared in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2012 13:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2013 21:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This means that each buyer $i$ wants a\nspecific number $d_i$ of items; a bundle of size less than $d_i$ has no value,\nwhile a bundle of size greater than $d_i$ is worth no more than the most valued\n$d_i$ items (valuations being additive). We consider the objective of setting\nprices and allocations in order to maximize the total revenue of the market\nmaker. The pricing problem with sharp multi-unit demand buyers has a number of\nproperties that the unit-demand model does not possess, and is an important\nquestion in algorithmic pricing. We consider the problem of computing a revenue\nmaximizing solution for two solution concepts: competitive equilibrium and\nenvy-free pricing.\n  For unrestricted valuations, these problems are NP-complete; we focus on a\nrealistic special case of \"correlated values\" where each buyer $i$ has a\nvaluation $v_i\\qual_j$ for item $j$, where $v_i$ and $\\qual_j$ are positive\nquantities associated with buyer $i$ and item $j$ respectively. We present a\npolynomial time algorithm to solve the revenue-maximizing competitive\nequilibrium problem. For envy-free pricing, if the demand of each buyer is\nbounded by a constant, a revenue maximizing solution can be found efficiently;\nthe general demand case is shown to be NP-hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2012 14:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 13:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 18:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2013 01:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 15:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Previous phenomenological\nstudies have focussed on potential signatures for such a model at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). However, there are interesting regions of the parameter\nspace in which the heavier Higgs state would be out of reach for LHC searches\nif its mass is greater than 1 TeV. We therefore investigate the discovery\npotential for such a particle at a 3 TeV electron-positron collider, which is\nmotivated by the recent developments of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC).
