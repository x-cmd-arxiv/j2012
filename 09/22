This embodies some expected properties of\nexpectation values in conformal loop ensembles CLE. In the context of conformal\nrestriction systems, we study certain algebra elements associated with\nhypotrochoid simple curves (including the ellipse). These have the CLE\ninterpretation of being \"renormalized random variables\" that are nonzero only\nif there is at least one loop of hypotrochoid shape. Each curve has a center w,\na scale \\epsilon\\ and a rotation angle \\theta, and we analyze the renormalized\nrandom variable as a function of u=\\epsilon e^{i\\theta} and w. We find that it\nhas an expansion in positive powers of u and u*, and that the coefficients of\npure u (u*) powers are holomorphic in w (w*). We identify these coefficients\n(the \"hypotrochoid fields\") with certain Virasoro descendants of the identity\nfield in conformal field theory, thereby showing that they form part of a\nvertex operator algebraic structure.

In this paper, to allow each relay node the freedom of choosing\neither of the two strategies, we propose a unified framework, where both the\nD-F and C-F strategies can be employed simultaneously in the network. It turns\nout that, to fully incorporate the advantages of both the best known D-F and\nC-F strategies into a unified framework, the major challenge arises as follows:\nFor the D-F relay nodes to fully utilize the help of the C-F relay nodes,\ndecoding at the D-F relay nodes should not be conducted until all the blocks\nhave been finished; However, in the multi-level D-F strategy, the upstream\nnodes have to decode prior to the downstream nodes in order to help, which\nmakes simultaneous decoding at all the D-F relay nodes after all the blocks\nhave been finished inapplicable. To tackle this problem, nested blocks combined\nwith backward decoding are used in our framework, so that the D-F relay nodes\nat different levels can perform backward decoding at different frequencies. As\nsuch, the upstream D-F relay nodes can decode before the downstream D-F relay\nnodes, and the use of backward decoding at each D-F relay node ensures the full\nexploitation of the help of both the other D-F relay nodes and the C-F relay\nnodes.

In this work we studied the\nelectrophysiological correlates of dynamical BOLD functional connectivity\nfluctuations, by means of long (approx. 50 min) joint electroencephalographic\n(EEG) and fMRI recordings. We identified widespread positive and negative\ncorrelations between EEG spectral power and fMRI BOLD connectivity fluctuations\nin a network of 90 cortical and subcortical regions. In particular, increased\nalpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) power were related to decreased functional\nconnectivity, whereas gamma (30-60 Hz) power correlated positively with BOLD\nconnectivity between specific brain regions. Furthermore, these patterns were\naltered for subjects undergoing vigilance changes, with an involvement of the\nslow delta (0.4 - 4 Hz) band in localized positive correlations.

We examine the relationship of the two asymmetries $A_{FB}^t$ and\n$A_{FB}^\\ell$. We show their connection through the $(V-A)$ spin correlation\nbetween the charged lepton and the top quark with different polarization\nstates. We show that the ratio of the two asymmetries provides independent\ninsight into new physics models that are invoked to fit the top quark\nasymmetry. We emphasize the value of the measurement of both asymmetries, and\nwe conclude that a model which produces more right-handed than left-handed top\nquarks is favored by the present Tevatron data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 04:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 20:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

Next, the subject leaves England for the\nContinent: the character of Lagrange is introduced, even if our interest\nconcerns only his 1785 memoir on irrational integrals, where the Arithmetic\nGeometric Mean, AGM, is established by him. Nevertheless, our objective is not\nthe AGM, but to detect the real source of the so-called Landen transformation\nfor elliptic integrals.

To make the best use of both telescope and human\nresources we must reduce the burden of data reduction.\n  Our instrumentation comprises of a flexible correlator, beam former and\nimager with digital signal processing closely coupled with a computing cluster.\nThis instrumentation will be highly accessible to scientists, engineers, and\nstudents for research and development of real-time processing algorithms, and\nwill tap into the pool of talented and innovative students and visiting\nscientists from engineering, computing, and astronomy backgrounds.\n  Adaptive real-time imaging will transform radio astronomy by providing\nreal-time feedback to observers. Calibration of the data is made in close to\nreal time using a model of the sky brightness distribution. The derived\ncalibration parameters are fed back into the imagers and beam formers. The\nregions imaged are used to update and improve the a-priori model, which becomes\nthe final calibrated image by the time the observations are complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 23:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

To a great extent their usefulness is due to\nunusual diffusive features, allowing much faster spreading than their classical\ncounterparts. Such behavior, although frequently credited to intrinsic quantum\ninterference, usually is not completely characterized. Using a recently\ndeveloped Green's function approach [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 84}, 042343 (2011)],\nhere it is described -- in a rather general way -- the problem dynamics in\nterms of a true sum over paths history a la Feynman.

The present analysis has the potential to help in designing\nquantum walks with distinct transport properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2012 02:25:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 17:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-09"}

We generalize the\ndisk evaporation model used in the interpretative framework of black hole X-ray\nbinaries by including the effect of a magnetic field in accretion disks\nsurrounding supermassive black holes. The critical transition mass accretion\nrate for which the disk is truncated is found to be insensitive to magnetic\neffects, but its inclusion leads to a smaller truncation radius in comparison\nto a model without its consideration. That is, a thin viscous disk is truncated\nfor LLAGN at an Eddington ratio less than 0.03 for a standard viscosity\nparameter ($\\alpha = 0.3$). An increase of the viscosity parameter results in a\nhigher critical transition mass accretion rate and a correspondingly smaller\ntruncation distance, the latter accentuated by greater magnetic energy\ndensities in the disk. Based on these results, the truncation radii inferred\nfrom spectral fits of LLAGN published in the literature are consistent with the\ndisk evaporation model. The infrared emission arising from the truncated\ngeometrically thin accretion disks may be responsible for the red bump seen in\nsuch LLAGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2012 05:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres\ncontain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance, very\nlittle is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share\ncommon properties between different species across different phyla. We used\nbioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species\nusing publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. The assumption that\nthe most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA was true for most species\nwhose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a\ngeneral property of genomes. Our methods are compatible with all current\nsequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to\nfind tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp. High-copy centromere tandem repeats\nwere found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were\nhighly variable in sequence composition and in length. Furthermore,\nphylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence\nconservation beyond ~50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an\noverall lack of sequence conservation, centromere tandem repeats from diverse\nspecies showed similar modes of evolution, including the appearance of higher\norder repeat structures in which several polymorphic monomers make up a larger\nrepeating unit. While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically\ndetermined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at\ncentromeres of both animals and plants. This suggests a functional role for\nsuch repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across\nchromosomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2012 07:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}

Upon applying a density matrix approach, the\ncurrent is expressed in terms of rates obtained by considering a very small\nclass of diagrams which dress the sequential tunneling processes by charge\nfluctuations.
