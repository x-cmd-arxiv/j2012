To overcome this\nproblem, probability models are often used to produce more compact and\nconclusive results, albeit with some loss of accuracy. Bayesian statistics have\nbeen widely used in the development of probability models in machine learning\nin recent years and these methods have many advantages, including their\nabilities to avoid overfitting. In this paper, we develop two Bayesian mixture\nmodels with the Dirichlet distribution prior and the Dirichlet process (DP)\nprior to improve the previous non-Bayesian mixture model developed for\ntransaction dataset mining. We implement the inference of both mixture models\nusing two methods: a collapsed Gibbs sampling scheme and a variational\napproximation algorithm. Experiments in several benchmark problems have shown\nthat both mixture models achieve better performance than a non-Bayesian mixture\nmodel. The variational algorithm is the faster of the two approaches while the\nGibbs sampling method achieves a more accurate results. The Dirichlet process\nmixture model can automatically grow to a proper complexity for a better\napproximation. Once the model is built, it can be very fast to query and run\nanalysis on (typically 10 times faster than Eclat, as we will show in the\nexperiment section). However, these approaches also show that mixture models\nunderestimate the probabilities of frequent itemsets. Consequently, these\nmodels have a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 16:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}

As a consequence, the\nsolutions of Kolmogorov PDEs are smooth at all positive times if the\ncoefficients of the PDE are smooth and satisfy H\\\"{o}rmander's condition even\nif the initial function is only continuous but not differentiable. First-order\nlinear Kolmogorov PDEs with smooth coefficients do not have this smoothing\neffect but at least preserve regularity in the sense that solutions are smooth\nif their initial functions are smooth. In this article, we consider the\nintermediate regime of nonhypoelliptic second-order Kolmogorov PDEs with smooth\ncoefficients. The main observation of this article is that there exist\ncounterexamples to regularity preservation in that case. More precisely, we\ngive an example of a second-order linear Kolmogorov PDE with globally bounded\nand smooth coefficients and a smooth initial function with compact support such\nthat the unique globally bounded viscosity solution of the PDE is not even\nlocally H\\\"{o}lder continuous. From the perspective of probability theory, the\nexistence of this example PDE has the consequence that there exists a\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with globally bounded and smooth\ncoefficients and a smooth function with compact support which is mapped by the\ncorresponding transition semigroup to a function which is not locally\nH\\\"{o}lder continuous. In other words, degenerate noise can have a roughening\neffect. A further implication of this loss of regularity phenomenon is that\nnumerical approximations may converge without any arbitrarily small polynomial\nrate of convergence to the true solution of the SDE.

This Hamiltonian\ninvolves four-body interactions between spins located at the same plaquette or\nvertex, which are quadratic in the spin-1 operators. Vertex and plaquette\ninteraction terms are not mutually commuting. The model displays gapped\nexcitations which result from merging anyons in both toric-code copies. These\nexcitations exhibit non-Abelian braiding properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 19:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

It is well known that modular\ninvariance fixes strong constraints that in some cases appear only at higher\ngenus. Here we classify all the Weyl and modular invariant partition functions\ngiven by the path integral on the world-sheet metric, together with space-time\ncoordinates, b-c and/or beta-gamma systems, that correspond to volume forms on\nM_g. This was a long standing question, advocated by Belavin and Knizhnik,\ninspired by the Serre GAGA principle and based on the properties of the Mumford\nforms. The key observation is that the Bergman reproducing kernel provides a\nWeyl and modular invariant way to remove the point dependence that appears in\nthe above string determinants, a property that should have its superanalog\nbased on the super Bergman reproducing kernel. This is strictly related to the\nproperties of the propagator associated to the space-time coordinates. Such\npartition functions Z[J] have well-defined asymptotic behavior and can be\nconsidered as a basis to represent a wide class of string theories. In\nparticular, since non-critical bosonic string partition functions Z_D are\nvolume forms on M_g, we suggest that there is a mapping, based on bosonization\nand degeneration techniques, from the Liouville sector to first order systems\nthat may identify Z_D as a subclass of the Z[J]. The appearance of b-c and\nbeta-gamma systems of any conformal weight shows that such theories are related\nto W algebras. The fact that in a large N 't Hooft-like limit 2D W_N minimal\nmodels CFTs are related to higher spin gravitational theories on AdS_3,\nsuggests that the string partition functions introduced here may lead to a\nformulation of higher spin theories in a string context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 19:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 19:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2013 23:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

We begin with a\nreview of the traditional TF model without an explicit spin interaction and\nfind that the spin splittings are too small in this approach. An explicit spin\ninteraction is then introduced which entails the definition of a generalized\nspin \"flavor\". We investigate baryonic states in this approach which can be\ndescribed with two inequivalent wave functions; such states can however apply\nto multiple degenerate flavors. We find that the model requires a spatial\nseparation of quark flavors, even if completely degenerate. Although the TF\nmodel is designed to investigate the possibility of many-quark states, we find\nsurprisingly that it may be used to fit the low energy spectrum of almost all\nground state octet and decuplet baryons. The charge radii of such states are\ndetermined and compared with lattice calculations and other models. The low\nenergy fit obtained allows us to extrapolate to the six-quark doubly strange\n{\\it H}-dibaryon state, flavor symmetric strange states of higher quark content\nand possible six quark nucleon-nucleon resonances. The emphasis here is on the\n{\\it systematics} revealed in this approach. We view our model as a versatile\nand convenient tool for quickly assessing the characteristics of new, possibly\nbound, particle states of higher quark number content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 23:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2013 17:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-12"}

Two different cases when the monopole locates either within the\nupper or the middle layer are of our interest. In the bottom layer, there is a\ndelta function topographic feature, which generates a closed recirculation\nregion in its vicinity due to the background flow. This recirculation region\nextends to the middle and upper layers, and it plays the role of a topographic\nvortex. The interaction between the monopole and the topographic vortex causes\ncomplex, including chaotic, advection of fluid particles. We show that the\nmodel's parameters, namely, the monopole and topographic vortices' strengths\nand initial positions, the layers' depths and densities are responsible for the\ndiverse advection patterns. While the patterns are rather complicated, however,\none can single out two major processes, which mostly govern fluid particle\nadvection. The first one is the variation in time of the system's phase space\nstructure, so that within the closed region of the topographic vortex, there\nappear periodically unclosed particle pathways by which the particles leave the\ntopographic vortex.

However, some astrophysical processes (e.g.\njets from active galaxies, galactic winds, or ram-pressure stripping in galaxy\nclusters) can provide localized seed magnetic fields. In this paper, we\nnumerically study amplification of localized seed magnetic fields in a\nturbulent medium. Throughout the paper, we assume that driving scale of\nturbulence is comparable to the size of the system. Our findings are as\nfollows. First, turbulence can amplify a localized seed magnetic field very\nefficiently. The growth rate of magnetic energy density is as high as that for\na uniform seed magnetic field. This result implies that a magnetic field\nejected from an astrophysical object can be a viable source of magnetic field\nin a cluster. Second, the localized seed magnetic field disperses and fills the\nwhole system very fast. If turbulence in a system (e.g. a galaxy cluster or a\nfilament) is driven at large scales, we expect that it takes a few large-eddy\nturnover times for magnetic field to fill the whole system.

Fourth, even in decaying turbulence, a\nlocalized seed magnetic field can ultimately fill the whole system.

The issue of whether or not\nmarginalizing the full table of registers by covariates over one or more\ncovariates leaves the estimated population size estimate invariant is\nintimately related to collapsibility of contingency tables [Biometrika 70\n(1983) 567-578].

We give a short path\ncharacterization of the loglinear model which describes when marginalizing over\na covariate leads to different population size estimates. Covariates that are\ncollapsible are called passive, to distinguish them from covariates that are\nnot collapsible and are termed active.

The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an\nincrease in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained\nhigh-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light\ncurve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM. In principle, the bipolar shape has already\nbeen explained in earlier studies of interacting winds, except that here the\nCSM interaction occurs over only 10 years, producing a thin shell with the\nresulting structures then frozen-in to the expanding bipolar nebula. This\nself-consistent picture has a number of implications for other eruptive\ntransients, many of which may also be powered by CSM interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 08:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

According to\nAaronson-Darling-Kac theorem, in non-aged dynamical systems with infinite\ninvariant measures, the distribution of the normalized time averages of\nintegrable functions converge to the Mittag-Leffler distribution. This well\nknown theorem holds when the start of observations coincides with the start of\nthe dynamical processes. Introducing a concept of the aging limit where the\naging time $t_a$ and the total measurement time $t$ goes to infinity while the\naging ratio $t_a/t$ is a constant, we obtain a novel distributional limit\ntheorem of time-averaged observables integrable with respect to the infinite\ninvariant density. Applying the theorem to the Lyapunov exponent in\nintermittent maps, we find that regular motions and a weakly chaotic behavior\ncoexist in the aging limit. This mixed type of dynamics is controlled by the\naging ratio and hence is very different from the usual scenario of regular and\nchaotic motions in Hamiltonian systems. The probability of finding regular\nmotions in non-aged processes is zero, while in the aging regime it is finite\nand it increases when system ages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 09:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Here we discuss two\nfundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly\naffect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a\nremedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters\nconsiders the geometrical arrangement of a set of neighboring spheres NN(p)\naround a given central particle p; we show that procedure to select the spheres\nconstituting the neighborhood NN(p) can have greater influence on both the\nnumerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical\nparameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of\nneighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle\ncoordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness\nof the ql as structure metrics.

Five non-potential parameters, i.e.,\nelectric current, current helicity, source field, photospheric free energy, and\nangular shear, are calculated in this work to quantify the non-potentiality of\nNOAA AR 11158. Benefited from high spatial resolution, high cadence, and\ncontinuously temporal coverage of vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, both the long-term\nevolution of the AR and the rapid change during flares have been studied. We\nconfirmed that, comparing with the magnetic flux, the magnetic non-potentiality\nhas a closer connection with the flare, and the emerging flux regions are\nimportant for the magnetic non-potentiality and flares. The main results of\nthis work are as follows. (1) The vortex in the source field directly displays\nthe deflection of horizontal magnetic field. The deflection is corresponding to\nthe fast rotated sunspot with a time delay, which suggests that the sunspot\nrotation leads to an increase of the non-potentiality. (2) Two areas that have\nevident changes of the azimuth of the vector magnetic field are found near the\nmagnetic polarity inversion line. The change rates of the azimuth are about 1.3\ndeg/h and 3.6 deg/h, respectively.

The shape of the distribution varies essentially with depth\nin the photosphere. The distribution maximum lies about at 25 mT, but it is\nfound near 35 mT when the spatial averaging of profiles (about 0.5\") is taken\ninto account. Our analysis reveals that the use of the Fe I 1564.8 nm line for\ndetermination of field strength from V profile splitting is the most efficient\nand reliable means of measuring fields above 50 mT.

The\nanalysis of the synthesized Fe I 630.2 nm line profiles supports the conclusion\nthat this line is less suitable for studying field strength distributions\nbecause of its weak magnetic sensitivity to fields below 120 mT. The derived\nmagnetic field distributions as well as the distributions of asymmetry\nparameters and V profile zero-crossings are in good agreement with IR\npolarimetry data.

Some of distinctive features of the\nproposed ITS are diversity as well as the combined and fine-grained\nrejuvenation approach. The security of the proposed architecture is evaluated\nwith regard to availability and mean time to security failure as performance\nmeasures.

Multiple\nstacks were generated, based on the radio luminosity of the point sources. The\nresulting stacked images show central peaks similar to point sources.

Some more elaborate\nglobal optimization approaches, e.g. DIRECT, have earlier been adopted to QTL\nsearch problems. Dramatic speedups have been reported for high-dimensional\nscans. However, since a heuristic termination criterion must be used in these\ntypes of algorithms the accuracy of the optimization process cannot be\nguaranteed.

The bound is derived for both infinite size and finite size\npopulations. Introducing a Lipschitz bound in DIRECT leads to an algorithm\nrelated to classical Lipschitz optimization.

While such signals have many\nscientific and technological applications, their actual use is hampered by the\nfact that an overwhelming proportion of the energy goes into that part of the\nsignal, which is not superoscillating. In the present article we consider the\nproblem of optimization of such signals. The optimization that we describe here\nis that of the superoscillation yield, the ratio of the energy in the\nsuperoscillations to the total energy of the signal, given the range and\nfrequency of the superoscillations. The constrained optimization leads to a\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem, which is solved numerically. It is noteworthy\nthat it is possible to increase further the superoscillation yield at the cost\nof slightly deforming the oscillatory part of the signal, while keeping the\naverage frequency. We show, how this can be done gradually, which enables a\ntrade-off between the distortion and the yield. We show how to apply this\napproach to non-trivial domains, and explain how to generalize this to higher\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 15:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 2013 20:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 18:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-01"}

Different authors have used\nvarious methods to solve governing differential equation of heat conduction\nproblem. In this study, heat conduction in a circular rod has been considered\nwhich is made up of two different materials viz. aluminum and copper. In\nearlier studies parameters in the differential equation have been taken as\nfixed (crisp) numbers which actually may not. Those parameters are found in\ngeneral by some measurements or experiments. So the material properties are\nactually uncertain and may be considered to vary in an interval or as fuzzy and\nin that case complex interval arithmetic or fuzzy arithmetic has to be\nconsidered in the analysis. As such the problem is discretized into finite\nnumber of elements which depend on interval/fuzzy parameters. Representation of\ninterval/fuzzy numbers may give the clear picture of uncertainty. Hence\ninterval/fuzzy arithmetic is applied in the finite element method to solve a\nsteady state heat conduction problem. Application of fuzzy finite element\nmethod in the said problem gives fuzzy system of linear equations in general.\nHere new methods have also been proposed to handle such type of fuzzy system of\nlinear equations. Corresponding results are computed and has been reported\nhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 17:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-01"}

The gold nanoclusters with small size can\npenetrate kidney tissue and have promise to decrease in vivo toxicity by renal\nclearance. In this work, we explore the in vivo renal clearance,\nbiodistribution, and toxicity responses of the BSA- and GSH-protected gold\nnanoclusters for 24 hours and 28 days. The BSA-protected gold nanoclusters have\nlow-efficient renal clearance and only 1% of gold can be cleared, but the\nGSH-protected gold nanoclusters have high-efficient renal clearance and 36 % of\ngold can be cleared after 24 hours. The biodistribution further reveals that\n94% of gold can be metabolized for the GSH-protected nanoclusters, but only\nless than 5% of gold can be metabolized for the BSA-protected nanoclusters\nafter 28 days. Both of the GSH- and BSA-protected gold nanoclusters cause acute\ninfection, inflammation, and kidney function damage after 24 hours, but these\ntoxicity responses for the GSH-protected gold nanoclusters can be eliminated\nafter 28 days. Immune system can also be affected by the two kinds of gold\nnanoclusters, but the immune response for the GSH-protected gold nanoclusters\ncan also be recovered after 28 days. These findings show that the GSH-protected\ngold nanoclusters have small size and can be metabolized by renal clearance and\nthus the toxicity can be significantly decreased. The BSA- protected gold\nnanoclusters, however, can form large compounds and further accumulate in liver\nand spleen which can cause irreparable toxicity response. Therefore, the\nGSH-protected gold nanoclusters have great potential for in vivo imaging and\ntherapy, and the BSA-protected gold nanoclusters can be used as the agent of\nliver cancer therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 08:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-02"}
