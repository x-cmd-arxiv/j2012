We find\nthat in the presence of the quasar s the comoving HII bubble radii reach 10\nMpc/h after 20 My while with the stellar component alone the HII bubbles are\nsmaller by at least an order of magnitude. Our calculations show that several\nfeatures are not captured within an analytical growth model of Stromgren\nspheres. The X-ray photons from hard quasar spectra drive a smooth transition\nfrom fully neutral to partially neutral in the ionization front. However the\ntransition from partially neutral to fully ionized is significantly more\ncomplex. We measure the distance to the edge of bubbles as a function of angle\nand use the standard deviation of these distances as a diagnostic of the\nisotropy of ionized regions. We find that the overlapping of nearby ionized\nregions from clustered halos not only increases the anisotropy, but also is the\nmain mechanism which allows the outer radius to grow. We therefore predict that\nquasar ionized bubbles at this early stage in the reionization process should\nbe both significantly larger and more irregularly shaped than bubbles around\nstar forming galaxies.

One approach to\ndealing with differing sample depth for a given diversity statistic is to\nrarefy, which means to take a random subset of a given size of the original\nsample. Exact analytical formulae for the mean and variance of species richness\nunder rarefaction have existed for some time but no such solution exists for\nPD. We have derived exact formulae for the mean and variance of PD under\nrarefaction. We show that these formulae are correct by comparing exact\nsolution mean and variance to that calculated by repeated random (Monte Carlo)\nsubsampling of a dataset of stem counts of woody shrubs of Toohey Forest,\nQueensland, Australia. We also demonstrate the application of the method using\ntwo examples: identifying hotspots of mammalian diversity in Australasian\necoregions, and characterising the human vaginal microbiome. There is a very\nhigh degree of correspondence between the analytical and random subsampling\nmethods for calculating mean and variance of PD under rarefaction, although the\nMonte Carlo method requires a large number of random draws to converge on the\nexact solution for the variance. Rarefaction of mammalian PD of ecoregions in\nAustralasia to a common standard of 25 species reveals very different rank\norderings of ecoregions, indicating quite different hotspots of diversity than\nthose obtained for unrarefied PD. The application of these methods to the\nvaginal microbiome shows that a classical score used to quantify bacterial\nvaginosis is correlated with the shape of the rarefaction curve. The analytical\nformulae for the mean and variance of PD under rarefaction are both exact and\nmore efficient than repeated subsampling. Rarefaction of PD allows for many\napplications where comparisons of samples of different depth is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 17:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 01:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Observations of these objects show that the growth of\nprimordial sub micron sized particles into larger aggregates occurs at the\nearliest stages of the disks. However, theoretical models of particle growth\nthat use the Smoluchowski equation to describe collisional coagulation and\nfragmentation have so far failed to produce large particles while maintaining a\nsignificant populations of small grains. This has been generally attributed to\nthe existence of two barriers impeding growth due to bouncing and fragmentation\nof colliding particles. In this paper, we demonstrate that the importance of\nthese barriers has been artificially inflated through the use of simplified\nmodels that do not take into account the stochastic nature of the particle\nmotions within the gas disk. We present a new approach in which the relative\nvelocities between two particles is described by a probability distribution\nfunction that models both deterministic motion and stochastic motion. Taking\nboth into account can give quite different results to what has been considered\nrecently in other studies. We demonstrate the vital effect of two \"ingredients\"\nfor particle growth: the proper implementation of a velocity distribution\nfunction that overcomes the bouncing barrier and, in combination with mass\ntransfer in high-mass-ratio collisions, boosts the growth of larger particles\nbeyond the fragmentation barrier. A robust result of our simulations is the\nemergence of two particle populations (small and large), potentially explaining\nsimultaneously a number of long-standing problems in protoplanetary disks,\nincluding planetesimal formation close to the central star, the presence of mm\nto cm size particles far out in the disk, and the persistence of micron-size\ngrains for millions of years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 20:41:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 20:02:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2012 10:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In the context of multivariate stable distributions we\npropose several ways to perform statistical inference and obtain the spectral\nmeasure associated with the distributions, a quantity that has been a major\nimpediment in using them in applied work. We extend the techniques to handle\nunivariate and multivariate stochastic volatility models, static and dynamic\nfactor models with disturbances and factors from general stable distributions,\na novel way to model multivariate stochastic volatility through time-varying\nspectral measures and a novel way to multivariate stable distributions through\ncopulae. The new techniques are applied to artificial as well as real data (ten\nmajor currencies, SP100 and individual returns). In connection with ABC special\nattention is paid to crafting well-performing proposal distributions for MCMC\nand extensive numerical experiments are conducted to provide critical values of\nthe \"closeness\" parameter that can be useful for further applied econometric\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 21:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}

Our models establish that the observed nearly constant equivalent\nwidth of [N I] with respect to the dust-scattered stellar continuum depends\nprimarily on three factors: the FUV to visual-band flux ratio of the stellar\npopulation; the optical properties of the dust; and the line broadening where\nthe pumping occurs. In contrast, the intensity ratio [N I]/H{\\beta} depends\nprimarily on the FUV to extreme-ultraviolet ratio, which varies strongly with\nthe spectral type of the exciting star. This is consistent with the observed\ndifference of a factor of five between M42 and M43, which are excited by an O7\nand B0.5 star respectively. We derive a non-thermal broadening of order 5 km/s\nfor the [N I] pumping zone and show that the broadening mechanism must be\ndifferent from the large-scale turbulent motions that have been suggested to\nexplain the line-widths in this H II region.

In a previous study\nwe presented constraints on the habitability of moons from stellar and\nplanetary illumination as well as from tidal heating. Here I refine our model\nby including the effect of eclipses on the orbit-averaged illumination. Moons\nin low-mass stellar systems must orbit their planet very closely to remain\nbound, which puts them at risk of strong tidal heating. I first describe the\neffect of eclipses on stellar illumination of satellites. Then I calculate the\norbit-averaged energy flux including illumination from the planet and tidal\nheating. Habitability is defined by a scaling relation at which a moon loses\nits water by the runaway greenhouse process. As a working hypothesis, orbital\nstability is assumed if the moon's orbital period is less than 1/9 of the\nplanet's orbital period. Due to eclipses, a satellite in a close orbit can\nexperience a reduction in orbit-averaged stellar flux by up to about 6%. The\nsmaller the semi-major axis and the lower the inclination of the moon's orbit,\nthe stronger the reduction. I find a lower mass limit of ~0.2M_sun for exomoon\nhost stars to avoid the runaway greenhouse effect. Precise estimates depend on\nthe satellite's orbital eccentricity. Deleterious effects on exomoon\nhabitability may occur up to ~0.5M_sun. Although the habitable zone lies close\nto low-mass stars, which allows for many transits of planet-moon binaries\nwithin a given observation cycle, resources should not be spent to trace\nhabitable satellites around them. Gravitational perturbations by the star,\nanother planet, or another satellite induce eccentricities that likely make any\nmoon uninhabitable. Estimates for individual systems require dynamical\nsimulations that include perturbations among all bodies and tidal heating in\nthe satellite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2012 03:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Although the first two reactions have been observed and measured\nsince long ago, the third process, resulting in the invisible final state, has\nnever been experimentally tested. It may go either directly, or, at low\nenergies, via the annihilation of a muon and an electron from an atomic bound\nstate, called muonium (M=\\mu^+e^-). The M\\to \\nu_\\mu \\nu_e decay is expected to\nbe a very rare process, with the branching fraction predicted to be Br(M\\to\n\\nu_\\mu\\nu_e) = 6.6 10^{-12} with respect to the ordinary muon decay rate.\nUsing the reported experimental results on precision measurements of the\npositive muon lifetime by the MuLan Collaboration, we set the first limit Br(M\n\\to invisible) < 5.7 10^{-6}, while still leaving a big gap of about six orders\nof magnitude between this bound and the predictions. To improve substantially\nthe limit, we proposed to perform an experiment dedicated to the sensitive\nsearch for the M\\to invisible decay. A feasibility study of the experimental\nsetup shows that the sensitivity of the search for this decay mode in branching\nfraction Br(M\\to invisible) at the level of 10^{-12} could be achieved. If the\nproposed search results in a substantially higher branching fraction than\npredicted, say Br(M \\to invisible) < 10^{-10}, this would unambiguously\nindicate the presence of new physics.
