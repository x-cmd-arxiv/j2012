We merge the WISE data with optical SDSS data and\nprovide a phenomenological characterization of mid-IR, extragalactic sources.\nWISE is most sensitive at 3.4micron(W1) and least at 22micron(W4). The W1 band\nprobes massive early-type galaxies out to z\\gtrsim1. This is more distant than\nSDSS identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of\n3.4micron sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r>22.2). In contrast,\n92-95% of 12 and 22micron sources have SDSS optical counterparts with r<22.2.\nWISE 3.4micron detects 89.8% of the entire SDSS QSO catalog at SNR(W1)>7, but\nonly 18.9% at 22micron with SNR(W4)>5. We show that WISE colors alone are\neffective in isolating stars (or local early-type galaxies), star-forming\ngalaxies and strong AGN/QSOs at z<3. We highlight three major applications of\nWISE colors: (1) Selection of strong AGN/QSOs at z<3 using W1-W2>0.8 and\nW2<15.2 criteria, producing a census of this population. The surface density of\nthese strong AGN/QSO candidates is 67.5+-0.14/deg^2. (2) Selection of\ndust-obscured, type-2 AGN/QSO candidates. We show that WISE W1-W2>0.8, W2<15.2\ncombined with r-W2>6 (Vega) colors can be used to identify type-2 AGN\ncandidates. The fraction of these type-2 AGN candidates is 1/3rd of all WISE\ncolor-selected AGNs. (3) Selection of ULIRGs at z\\sim2 with extremely red\ncolors, r-W4>14 or well-detected 22micron sources lacking detections in the 3.4\nand 4.6micron bands. The surface density of z~2 r-W4>14 ULIRGs is\n0.9+-0.07/deg^2 at SNR(W4)>5 (flux(W4)>=2.5mJy), which is consistent with that\ninferred from smaller area Spitzer surveys. Optical spectroscopy of a small\nnumber of these high-redshift ULIRGs confirms our selection, and reveals a\npossible trend that optically fainter or r-W4 redder candidates are at higher\nredshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 17:13:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 19:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Here we introduce a preliminary version of the\nq-gradient method for unconstrained global optimization. The main idea behind\nour approach is the use of the negative of the q-gradient of the objective\nfunction as the search direction. In this sense, the method here proposed is a\ngeneralization of the well-known steepest descent method. The use of Jackson's\nderivative has shown to be an effective mechanism for escaping from local\nminima.

This phenomenon, now known as Haldane's rule, has\nbeen repeatedly confirmed across broad taxa in diecious animals and plants.\nCurrently, the dominant view in the field of speciation genetics believes that\nHaldane's rule for sterility, inviability, male heterogamety and female\nheterogametic belongs to different entities; and Haldane's rule in these\nsubdivisions has different causes, which operate coincidentally and/or\ncollectively resulting in this striking bias against the heterogametic sex in\nhybridization.

However, far from being a\nbenign culinary herb, cilantro can be polarizing---many people love it while\nothers claim that it tastes or smells foul, often like soap or dirt. This soapy\nor pungent aroma is largely attributed to several aldehydes present in\ncilantro. Cilantro preference is suspected to have a genetic component, yet to\ndate nothing is known about specific mechanisms. Here we present the results of\na genome-wide association study among 14,604 participants of European ancestry\nwho reported whether cilantro tasted soapy, with replication in a distinct set\nof 11,851 participants who declared whether they liked cilantro. We find a\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly associated with soapy-taste\ndetection that is confirmed in the cilantro preference group. This SNP,\nrs72921001, (p=6.4e-9, odds ratio 0.81 per A allele) lies within a cluster of\nolfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11. Among these olfactory receptor genes\nis OR6A2, which has a high binding specificity for several of the aldehydes\nthat give cilantro its characteristic odor. We also estimate the heritability\nof cilantro soapy-taste detection in our cohort, showing that the heritability\ntagged by common SNPs is low, about 0.087. These results confirm that there is\na genetic component to cilantro taste perception and suggest that cilantro\ndislike may stem from genetic variants in olfactory receptors. We propose that\nOR6A2 may be the olfactory receptor that contributes to the detection of a\nsoapy smell from cilantro in European populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 19:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

Within this framework, we\ninvestigate the gravitational effects associated with a sufficiently wide\nbinary system, where Roche lobe overflow is unimportant, on the outflowing\nenvelopes of AGB stars using three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The\neffects due to individual binary components are separately studied, enabling\ninvestigation of the stellar and circumstellar characteristics in detail. The\nreflex motion of the AGB star alters the wind velocity distribution, thereby,\ndetermining the overall shape of the outflowing envelope. On the other hand,\nthe interaction of the companion with the envelope produces a gravitational\nwake, which exhibits a vertically thinner shape. The two patterns overlap and\nform clumpy structures. To illustrate the diversity of shapes, we present the\nnumerical results as a function of inclination angle. Not only is spiral\nstructure produced by the binary interaction, but arc patterns are also found\nthat represent the former structure when viewed at different inclinations. The\narcs reveal a systematic shift of their centers of curvature for cases when the\norbital speed of the AGB star is comparable to its wind speed. They take on the\nshape of a peanut for inclinations nearly edge-on. In the limit of slow orbital\nmotion of the AGB star relative to the wind speed, the arc pattern becomes\nnearly spherically symmetric.

To handle this, we propose a novel multicell framework with\ndynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small\nset of base stations. Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring\nterminals only, thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework\nscalable.

Although (P1) is non-convex and difficult to solve\noptimally, we are able to prove: 1) Optimality of single-stream beamforming; 2)\nConditions for full power usage; and 3) A precoding parametrization based on a\nfew parameters between zero and one.

The volume constraint fixes the distance $S$, measured\nalong the surface, between the two points; if it is relaxed, a second zero mode\nappears, reflecting the independence of the energy on $S$; in the absence of\nthis constraint a pathway opens for the membrane to slip out of the defect.\nLogarithmic curvature singularities in the surface geometry at the points of\ncontact signal the presence of external forces. The magnitude of these forces\nvaries inversely with $S$ and so diverges as the points merge; the\ncorresponding torques vanish in these defects.

A large portion of the existing literature does not build on real\nworld scenarios, hence, neglecting various important interactions of the\nresearch with commercial telecommunication networks. For instance, a lot of\nattention has been paid to spectrum sensing as the front line functionality\nthat needs to be completed in an efficient and accurate manner to enable an\nopportunistic CR network architecture. This is necessary to detect the\nexistence of spectrum holes without which no other procedure can be fulfilled.\nHowever, simply sensing (cooperatively or not) the energy received from a\nprimary transmitter cannot enable correct dynamic spectrum access.

Observations of circumstellar gas surrounding the mass\ndonor in RS Vul suggest magnetic effects could be responsible for deflecting\nthe accretion stream out of the orbital plane, resulting in a tilted disc. To\ndetermine whether a tilted disc is possible due to a deflected stream, we use\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the mass transfer process in RS\nVul. By deflecting the stream 45 degrees out of the orbital plane and boosting\nthe magnitude of the stream's velocity to Mach 30, we mimic the effects of\nmagnetic activity near L1. We find that the modified stream parameters change\nthe direct-impact nature of the system. The stream misses the surface of the\nstar, and a slightly warped accretion disc forms with no more than 3 degrees of\ndisc tilt. The stream-disc interaction for the deflected stream forces a large\ndegree of material above the orbital plane, increasing the out-of-plane flow\ndrastically. Plotting the H-alpha emissivity in velocity space allows us to\ncompare our results with tomographic observations. Deflecting and boosting the\nstream increases the emissivity in each z-velocity slice of the out-of-plane\nflow by at least three and up to eight orders of magnitude compared to the\nundeflected case. We conclude that a deflected stream is a viable mechanism for\nproducing the strong out-of-plane flows seen in the tomographic images of U CrB\nand RS Vul.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 22:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Many of these data sources can be\nmodeled as multi-relational graphs. Continuous queries or techniques to search\nfor rare events that typically arise in monitoring applications have been\nstudied extensively for relational databases. This work is dedicated to answer\nthe question that emerges naturally: how can we efficiently execute a\ncontinuous query on a dynamic graph? This paper presents an exact subgraph\nsearch algorithm that exploits the temporal characteristics of representative\nqueries for online news or social media monitoring. The algorithm is based on a\nnovel data structure called the Subgraph Join Tree (SJ-Tree) that leverages the\nstructural and semantic characteristics of the underlying multi-relational\ngraph.

Most previous work has\nassumed phase-aligned (coherent) transmissions from different base transceiver\nstations (BTSs), which is difficult to achieve in practice. In this work, a\nnoncoherent cooperative transmission scheme for the downlink is studied, which\ndoes not require phase alignment. The focus is on jointly serving two users in\nadjacent cells sharing the same resource block. The two BTSs partially share\ntheir messages through a backhaul link, and each BTS transmits a superposition\nof two codewords, one for each receiver. Each receiver decodes its own message,\nand treats the signals for the other receiver as background noise. With\nnarrowband transmissions the achievable rate region and maximum achievable\nweighted sum rate are characterized by optimizing the power allocation (and the\nbeamforming vectors in the case of multiple transmit antennas) at each BTS\nbetween its two codewords. For a wideband (multicarrier) system, a dual\nformulation of the optimal power allocation problem across sub-carriers is\npresented, which can be efficiently solved by numerical methods.

In conventional relaying,\nsource and relay transmit signals in consecutive time slots whereas in\nbuffer-aided link adaptive relaying, the state of the source-relay and\nrelay-destination channels determines whether the source or the relay is\nselected for transmission.

This\nmodel postulates a starburst following each major merger, lasting for a time\nt_SF and converting at most f_star of galactic gas into stars. We include a\nsimple physical prescription for supernovae feedback that suppresses star\nformation in low mass galaxies. Constraining t_SF and f_star to describe the\nobserved star formation rate density at high redshifts, we find that individual\nstarbursts were terminated after a time t_SF~10^7 years. This is comparable to\nthe main-sequence lifetimes of supernova progenitors, indicating that high\nredshift starbursts are quenched once supernovae feedback had time to develop.\nHigh redshift galaxies convert ~10% of their mass into stars for galaxies with\nstar formation rates above ~1 solar mass per year, but a smaller fraction for\nlower luminosity galaxies. Our best fit model successfully predicts the\nobserved relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z>~4, while\nour deduced relation between stellar mass and halo mass is also consistent with\ndata on the dwarf satellites of the Milky Way.

In quantum-chemical approaches to X-ray\nspectroscopy, these so-called quadrupole intensities have so far been\ncalculated by including contributions depending on the square of the\nelectric-quadrupole and magnetic-dipole transition moments.

By solving coupled equations for magnetic energy\nand magnetic helicity in a system initiated with isotropic turbulence and an\narbitrarily helical large scale field, we quantify the decay rate of the latter\nfor a bounded or periodic system. The energy associated with the non-helical\nmagnetic field rapidly decays by turbulent diffusion, but the decay rate of the\nhelical component depends on whether the ratio of its magnetic energy to the\nturbulent kinetic energy exceeds a critical value given by M_{1,c}\n=(k_1/k_2)^2, where k_1 and k_2 are the wave numbers of the large and forcing\nscales. Turbulently diffusing helical fields to small scales while conserving\nmagnetic helicity requires a rapid increase in total magnetic energy. As such,\nonly when the helical fields are sub-critical can they so diffuse. When\nsuper-critical, the large scale helical field decays slowly, at a rate\ndetermined by microphysical dissipation even when macroscopic turbulence is\npresent. Amplification of small scale magnetic helicity abates the turbulent\ndiffusion. Two implications are that: (1) Standard arguments supporting the\nneed for in situ large scale dynamos based on the otherwise rapid turbulent\ndiffusion of large scale fields require re-thinking since only the non-helical\nfield is so diffused in a closed system. Boundary terms could however provide\npotential pathways for rapid change of the large scale helical field. (2) Since\nM_{1,c} <<1 for k_1 << k_2, the presence of long-lived ordered large scale\nhelical fields, as in extragalactic jets, does not guarantee that the magnetic\nfield dominates the kinetic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 06:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2012 07:54:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 06:26:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 02:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

Evolving from the $n=0$ Landau\nlevel, the central band of the Hofstadter butterfly is especially interesting\nsince it may hold a key to the mysteries of the fractional quantum Hall effect\nobserved in graphene. While the entire Hofstadter butterfly can be in principle\nobtained by solving Harper's equations numerically, the weak-field limit, most\nrelevant for experiment, is intractable due to the fact that the size of the\nHamiltonian matrix, that needs to be diagonalized, diverges. In this paper, we\ndevelop an effective Hamiltonian method that can be used to provide an accurate\nanalytic description of the central Hofstadter band in the weak-field regime.\nOne of the most important discoveries obtained in this work is that massless\nDirac particles always exist inside the central Hofstadter band no matter how\nsmall the magnetic flux may become. In other words, with its bandwidth\nbroadened by the lattice effect, the $n=0$ Landau level contains massless Dirac\nparticles within itself. In fact, by carefully analyzing the self-similar\nrecursive pattern of the central Hofstadter band, we conclude that massless\nDirac particles should occur under arbitrary magnetic field. As a corollary,\nthe central Hofstadter band also contains a self-similar structure of recursive\nLandau levels associated with such massless Dirac particles.

When specifying concurrent data structures, the main challenge\nis to make specifications stable, i.e., to ensure that they cannot be\ninvalidated by other threads. To this end, we propose to use history-based\nspecifications: instead of describing method behaviour in terms of the object's\nstate, we specify it in terms of the object's state history. A history is\ndefined as a list of state updates, which at all points can be related to the\nactual object's state.\n  We illustrate the approach on the BlockingQueue hierarchy from the\njava.util.concurrent library. We show how the behaviour of the interface\nBlockingQueue is specified, leaving a few decisions open to descendant classes.\nThe classes implementing the interface correctly inherit the specifications. As\na specification language, we use a combination of JML and permission-based\nseparation logic, including abstract predicates. This results in an abstract,\nmodular and natural way to specify the behaviour of concurrent queues.

By using numerical, N-body, hydrodynamic, chemistry simulations\nof different cosmological volumes with various Gaussian and non-Gaussian\nmodels, we self-consistently relate the cosmic star formation rate density to\nthe corresponding GRB rate. Assuming that GRBs are fair tracers of cosmic star\nformation, we find that positive local non-Gaussianities, described in terms of\nthe non-linear parameter, \\fnl, might boost significantly the GRB rate at high\nredshift, $z \\gg 6$. Deviations with respect to the Gaussian case account for a\nfew orders of magnitude if \\fnl$\\sim 1000$, one order of magnitude for\n\\fnl$\\sim 100$, and a factor of $\\sim 2$ for \\fnl$\\sim 50$. These differences\nare found only at large redshift, while at later times the rates tend to\nconverge. Furthermore, a comparison between our predictions and the observed\nGRB data at $z > 6$ allows to exclude large negative \\fnl, consistently with\nprevious works. Future detections of any long GRB at extremely high redshift\n($z\\sim 15-20$) could favor non-Gaussian scenarios with positive \\fnl. More\nstringent constraints require much larger high-$z$ GRB complete samples,\ncurrently not available in literature. By distinguishing the contributions to\nthe GRB rate from the metal-poor population III regime, and the metal-enriched\npopulation II-I regime, we conclude that the latter is a more solid tracer of\nthe underlying matter distribution, while the former is strongly dominated by\nfeedback mechanisms from the first, massive, short-lived stars, rather than by\npossible non-Gaussian fluctuations.

On small scales (deprojected distance < 0.5 kpc), HII\nregions exhibit local variations in oxygen abundance that are larger than 0.3\ndex in 33% of neighboring pairs. We do not identify a significant oxygen\nabundance gradient among PNe, but we do find a significant gradient in the [N\nII] ratio that varies systematically with surface brightness. Our results\nunderscore the complex and inhomogeneous nature of the ISM of M31, and our\ndataset illustrates systematic effects relevant to future studies of the\nmetallicity gradients in nearby spiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 08:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}

Combined\nwith high-frequency time-to-digital converters (TDCs), this technology opens up\nthe prospect of sensors capable of recording with high accuracy both the time\nand location of each detected photon. Such a capability could lead to\nsignificant improvements in imaging accuracy, especially for applications\noperating with low photon fluxes such as LiDAR and positron emission\ntomography.\n  The demands placed on on-chip readout circuitry imposes stringent trade-offs\nbetween fill factor and spatio-temporal resolution, causing many contemporary\ndesigns to severely underutilize the technology's full potential. Concentrating\non the low photon flux setting, this paper leverages results from group testing\nand proposes an architecture for a highly efficient readout of pixels using\nonly a small number of TDCs, thereby also reducing both cost and power\nconsumption. The design relies on a multiplexing technique based on binary\ninterconnection matrices. We provide optimized instances of these matrices for\nvarious sensor parameters and give explicit upper and lower bounds on the\nnumber of TDCs required to uniquely decode a given maximum number of\nsimultaneous photon arrivals.\n  To illustrate the strength of the proposed architecture, we note a typical\ndigitization result of a 120x120 photodiode sensor on a 30um x 30um pitch with\na 40ps time resolution and an estimated fill factor of approximately 70%, using\nonly 161 TDCs. The design guarantees registration and unique recovery of up to\n4 simultaneous photon arrivals using a fast decoding algorithm. In a series of\nrealistic simulations of scintillation events in clinical positron emission\ntomography the design was able to recover the spatio-temporal location of 98.6%\nof all photons that caused pixel firings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 09:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A number of factors, such as transcription re-initiation, strong\nchromatin regulation or genome neighboring organization, underlie this\ncoupling. However, these factors do not necessarily combine in equivalent ways\nand strengths in all genes. Can we identify then alternative architectures that\nmodulate in distinct ways the linkage of noise and plasticity? Here we first\nshow that strong chromatin regulation, commonly viewed as a source of coupling,\ncan lead to plasticity without noise. The nature of this regulation is relevant\ntoo, with plastic but noiseless genes being subjected to general activators\nwhereas plastic and noisy genes experience more specific repression.\nContrarily, in genes exhibiting poor transcriptional control, it is\ntranslational efficiency what separates noise from plasticity, a pattern\nrelated to transcript length. This additionally implies that genome neighboring\norganization -as modifier- appears only effective in highly plastic genes. In\nthis class, we confirm bidirectional promoters (bipromoters) as a configuration\ncapable to reduce coupling by abating noise but also reveal an important\ntrade-off, since bipromoters also decrease plasticity. This presents ultimately\na paradox between intergenic distances and modulation, with short intergenic\ndistances both associated and disassociated to noise at different plasticity\nlevels. Balancing the coupling among different types of expression variability\nappears as a potential shaping force of genome regulation and organization.\nThis is reflected in the use of different control strategies at genes with\ndifferent sets of functional constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2012 10:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-12"}

The focus is on\ndeviations from Richardson eddy-diffusivity model and in particular on the\nstrong fluctuations experienced by tracers. Evidence is obtained that the\ndistribution of distances attains an almost self-similar regime characterized\nby a very weak intermittency. The timescale of convergence to this behavior is\nfound to be given by the kinetic energy dissipation time measured at the scale\nof the initial separation. Conversely the velocity differences between tracers\nare displaying a strongly anomalous behavior whose scaling properties are very\nclose to that of Lagrangian structure functions. These violent fluctuations are\ninterpreted geometrically and are shown to be responsible for a long-term\nmemory of the initial separation. Despite this strong intermittency, it is\nfound that the mixed moment defined by the ratio between the cube of the\nlongitudinal velocity difference and the distance attains a statistically\nstationary regime on very short timescales.

Employing the formal tools\nworked out in the first paper of the series, 1101.1126 [hep-th], a thorough\nanalysis of rigid symmetries of the sigma model is carried out with emphasis on\nalgebraic structures on generalised tangent bundles over the target space of\nthe theory and over its state space that give rise to a realisation of the\nsymmetry algebra on states. The analysis leads to a proposal for a novel\ndifferential-algebraic construct extending the original definition of the\n(gerbe-twisted) Courant algebroid on the generalised tangent bundles over the\ntarget space in a manner codetermined by the structure of the 2-category of\nabelian bundle gerbes with connection over it.

The ensuing reinterpretation of the small\ngauge anomaly in terms of the twisted rel.

These calculations generated extensive debates on the validity of SC\nphase. Here we have re-examined the SC structure by performing more precise\ndensity functional calculations within hybrid functionals of\nHeyd-Scuseria-Erhzerhof (HSE) and PBE0. Our calculations were able to\nrationalize fundamentally the phase stability of SC structure over all other\nknown phases by evidence of its actual energetic stability above 33 GPa and its\nintrinsically dynamical stability without showing any imaginary phonons in the\nentire pressure range studied. We further established that the long-thought\ntheoretical I41/amd structure remains stable in a narrow pressure range before\nentering SC phase and is actually the structure of experimental Ca-III'\nsynthesized recently at low temperature 14 K as supported by the excellent\nagreement between our simulated X-ray diffraction patterns and the experimental\ndata.

Capitalizing on the view that more closely\nassociated words come together to express an opinion about a certain feature,\ndependency parsing is used to identify relations between the opinion\nexpressions. The system learns the set of significant relations to be used by\ndependency parsing and a threshold parameter which allows us to merge closely\nassociated opinion expressions.
