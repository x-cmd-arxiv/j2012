It was\ndiscovered that the superconducting coils of the main dipole magnets had become\nvertically displaced relative to their yokes since their construction.

It is revolutionary, not only because it will enable peak load\nshaving and will add resources to manage large distribution systems, but mainly\nbecause it will tap into an almost unexplored and extremely powerful pool of\nresources comprised of many small individual consumers on distribution grids.\nHowever, to utilize these resources effectively, the methods used to engage\nthese resources must yield accurate and reliable control. A diversity of\nmethods have been proposed to engage these new resources. As opposed to direct\nload control, many methods rely on consumers and/or loads responding to\nexogenous signals, typically in the form of energy pricing, originating from\nthe utility or system operator. Here, we propose an open loop\ncommunication-lite method for estimating the price elasticity of many customers\ncomprising a distribution system. We utilize a sparse linear regression method\nthat relies on operator-controlled, inhomogeneous minor price variations, which\nwill be fair to all the consumers. Our numerical experiments show that reliable\nestimation of individual and thus aggregated instantaneous elasticities is\npossible. We describe the limits of the reliable reconstruction as functions of\nthe three key parameters of the system: (i) ratio of the number of\ncommunication slots (time units) per number of engaged consumers; (ii) level of\nsparsity (in consumer response); and (iii) signal-to-noise ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 16:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

Only two\ncurrent observational methods of determining the mass profile, gravitational\nlensing and the caustic technique, are independent of the assumption of\ndynamical equilibrium. Both techniques enable determination of the extended\nmass profile at radii beyond the virial radius. For 19 clusters, we compare the\nmass profile based on the caustic technique with weak lensing measurements\ntaken from the literature. This comparison offers a test of systematic issues\nin both techniques. Around the virial radius, the two methods of mass\nestimation agree to within about 30%, consistent with the expected errors in\nthe individual techniques. At small radii, the caustic technique overestimates\nthe mass as expected from numerical simulations. The ratio between the lensing\nprofile and the caustic mass profile at these radii suggests that the weak\nlensing profiles are a good representation of the true mass profile. At radii\nlarger than the virial radius, the lensing mass profile exceeds the caustic\nmass profile possibly as a result of contamination of the lensing profile by\nlarge-scale structures within the lensing kernel.

The emergence of such \"Network-CDNs\"\n(NCDNs) are driven by market forces that place more value on content services\nthan just carrying the bits. NCDNs are also necessitated by the need to reduce\nthe cost of carrying ever-increasing volumes of traffic across their backbones.\nAn NCDN has the flexibility to determine both where content is placed and how\ntraffic is routed within the network. However NCDNs today continue to treat\ntraffic engineering independently from content placement and request\nredirection decisions. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between\ncontent distribution strategies and traffic engineering and ask how an NCDN\nshould engineer traffic in a content-aware manner. Our experimental analysis,\nbased on traces from a large content distribution network and real ISP\ntopologies, shows that effective content placement can significantly simplify\ntraffic engineering and in most cases obviate the need to engineer NCDN traffic\nall together! Further, we show that simple demand-oblivious schemes for routing\nand placement such as InverseCap and LRU suffice as they achieve network costs\nthat are close to the best possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 18:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

The implementation of both local and nonlocal\nelectronic effects using pseudospectral methods is key to PAMELA's efficiency,\nresulting in significantly reduced computational effort compared to\nfinite-element methods. In contrast to the new nonlocal exchange formalism\nimplemented in this work, we find that the simple, conventional\nSchrodinger-Poisson approaches commonly used in the literature (1) considerably\noverestimate the number of occupied electron levels, (2) overdelocalize\nelectrons in nanowires, and (3) significantly underestimate the relative energy\nseparation between electronic subbands.

Tidal dissipation at successive periastron\npassages removes orbital energy of the planet, which has the potential for\nchanges in semi-major axis of a factor of ten to a thousand. In the equilibrium\ntide approximation we show that, in order for high-eccentricity migration to\ntake place, the relative level of tidal dissipation in Jupiter analogues must\nbe at least 10 times higher than the upper-limit attributed to the Jupiter-Io\ninteraction. While this is not a severe problem for high-e migration, it\ncontradicts the results of several previous calculations.

For this sake specific error measures such as\nBregman distances and specific conditions on the solution such as source\nconditions or variational inequalities have been developed and used.\n  In this paper we provide, for a certain class of ill-posed linear operator\nequations, a convergence analysis that works for solutions that are not\ncompletely sparse, but have a fast decaying nonzero part. This case is not\ncovered by standard source conditions, but surprisingly can be treated with an\nappropriate variational inequality.

We model a coronal loop as an isolated, thin,\nmagnetic fibril that is anchored at two points in the photosphere. The\nequilibrium shape of the loop is determined by a balance between magnetic\nbuoyancy and magnetic tension, which is characterized by a Magnetic Bond Number\n\\epsilon, that is typically small |\\epsilon| << 1. This balance produces a loop\nthat has a variable radius of curvature. The resonant kink waves of such a loop\ncome in two polarizations that are decoupled from each other: waves with motion\ncompletely within the plane of the loop (normal oscillations) and waves with\nmotions that are completely horizontal, perpendicular to the plane of the loop\n(binormal oscillations). We solve for the eigensolutions of both polarizations\nusing perturbation theory for small Magnetic Bond Number. For modes of the same\norder, normal oscillations have smaller eigenfrequencies than binormal\noscillations. The additional forces of buoyancy and magnetic tension from the\ncurvature of the loop increase and decrease the mode frequencies, respectively.\nThe ratio of the frequencies of the first overtone to the fundamental mode is\nmodified by the inclusion of buoyancy and curvature. We find that the normal\npolarization possesses a frequency ratio that exceeds the canonical value of 2,\nwhereas the binormal polarization has a ratio less than 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 19:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

One minimal theory that realizes such a scenario is the\nAtomic Dark Matter model, in which two fermions oppositely charged under a new\nU(1) dark force are initially coupled to a thermal bath of \"dark photons\" but\neventually recombine into neutral atom-like bound states and begin forming\ngravitationally-bound structures. As dark atoms have (dark) atom-sized\ngeometric cross sections, this model also provides an example of\nself-interacting DM with a velocity-dependent cross section. Delayed kinetic\ndecoupling in this scenario predicts novel DM properties on small scales but\nretains the success of cold DM on larger scales. We calculate the atomic\nphysics necessary to capture the thermal history of this dark sector and show\nsignificant improvements over the standard atomic hydrogen calculation are\nneeded. We solve the Boltzmann equations that govern the evolution of\ncosmological fluctuations in this model and find in detail the impact of the\natomic DM scenario on the matter power spectrum and the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). This scenario imprints a new length scale, the\nDark-Acoustic-Oscillation (DAO) scale, on the matter density field. This DAO\nscale shapes the small-scale matter power spectrum and determines the minimal\nDM halo mass at late times which may be many orders of magnitude larger than in\na typical WIMP scenario.

We found a total of six\nPNe that present both OH maser and radio continuum emissions, as confirmed with\nradio interferometric observations. These are bona fide OHPNe. The confirmed\nOHPNe present a bipolar morphology in resolved images of their ionized emission\nat different wavelengths, suggesting that the OH maser emission in PNe is\nrelated to nonspherical mass-loss phenomena. The OH maser spectra in PNe\npresent a clear asymmetry, tending to show blueshifted emission with respect to\nthe systemic velocity. Their infrared colors suggest that most of these objects\nare very young PNe. OHPNe do not form a homogeneous group, and seem to\nrepresent a variety of different evolutionary stages. We suggest that OH masers\npumped in the AGB phase may disappear during the post-AGB phase, but reappear\nonce the source becomes a PN and its radio continuum emission is amplified by\nthe OH molecules. Therefore, OH maser emission could last significantly longer\nthan the previously assumed 1000 yr after the end of the AGB phase.

Counting the number of points on X over all finite field extensions of\nk will not determine the curve uniquely. Actually, a famous theorem of Tate\nimplies that two such curves over k have the same zeta function (i.e., the same\nnumber of points over all extensions of k) if and only if their corresponding\nJacobians are isogenous. We remedy this situation by showing that if, instead\nof just the zeta function, all Dirichlet L-series of the two curves are equal\nvia an isomorphism of their Dirichlet character groups, then the curves are\nisomorphic up to \"Frobenius twists\", i.e., up to automorphisms of the ground\nfield.

In a sense, the result solves the\nanalogue of the isospectrality problem for curves over finite fields (also know\nas the \"arithmetic equivalence problem\"): it says that a curve is determined by\n\"spectral\" data, namely, eigenvalues of the Frobenius operator of k acting on\nthe cohomology groups of all l-adic sheaves corresponding to Dirichlet\ncharacters.

We build on the framework that we have described in previous papers in\nthis series and develop a subvoxel method for the $\\partial I/\\partial t$\nterms. Results. We test the implementation by comparing the 3D results to our\nwell tested 1D time dependent radiative transfer code in spherical symmetry. A\nsimple 3D test model is also presented. Conclusions. The 3D time dependent\nradiative transfer method is now included in our 3D RT framework and in\nPHOENIX/3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 22:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}

The aim of this first paper is to investigate the reliability of the\nmany accretion tracers currently used to measure the mass accretion rate in\nlow-mass, young stars. We use our spectra to measure the accretion luminosity\nfrom the continuum excess emission in the UV and visual; the derived mass\naccretion rates range from 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ down to\n5$\\times10^{-11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, allowing us to investigate the\nbehavior of the accretion-driven emission lines in very-low mass accretion rate\nregimes. We compute the luminosity of ten accretion-driven emission lines, from\nthe UV to the near-IR, obtained simultaneously. Most of the secondary tracers\ncorrelate well with the accretion luminosity derived from the continuum excess\nemission. We confirm the validity of the correlations between accretion\nluminosities and line luminosities given in the literature, with the possible\nexception of H\\alpha. When looking at individual objects, we find that the\nHydrogen recombination lines, from the UV to the near-IR, give good and\nconsistent measurements of accretion luminosities, often in better agreement\nthan the uncertainties introduced by the adopted correlations. The average\naccretion luminosity derived from several Hydrogen lines, measured\nsimultaneously, have a much reduced error.

This gain\ndepends on the aggregate global cache size (i.e., the cumulative memory\navailable at all users), even though there is no cooperation among the users.\n  To evaluate and isolate these two gains, we introduce an\ninformation-theoretic formulation of the caching problem focusing on its basic\nstructure. For this setting, we propose a novel coded caching scheme that\nexploits both local and global caching gains, leading to a multiplicative\nimprovement in the peak rate compared to previously known schemes. In\nparticular, the improvement can be on the order of the number of users in the\nnetwork. Moreover, we argue that the performance of the proposed scheme is\nwithin a constant factor of the information-theoretic optimum for all values of\nthe problem parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 01:23:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 21:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-06"}

While one-way relay with a single data flow\nintroduces loss in spectral efficiency due to its half-duplex operation,\ntwo-way relaying based on wireless network coding regains part of this loss by\nsimultaneously processing the two data flows. In a broader perspective, the\ntwo-way traffic pattern is rather limited and it is of interest to investigate\nother traffic patterns where such a simultaneous processing of information\nflows can bring performance advantage. In this paper we consider a scenario\nbeyond the usual two-way relaying: a four-way relaying, where each of the two\nMobile Stations (MSs) has a two-way connection to the same Base Station (BS),\nwhile each connection is through a dedicated Relay Station (RS). While both RSs\nare in the range of the same BS, they are assumed to have antipodal positions\nwithin the cell, such that they do not interfere with each other. We introduce\nand analyze a two-phase transmission scheme to serve the four-way traffic\npattern defined in this scenario. Each phase consists of combined broadcast and\nmultiple access. We analyze the achievable rate region of the new schemes for\ntwo different operational models for the RS, Decode-and-Forward (DF) and\nAmplify-and-Forward (AF), respectively. We compare the performance with a\nstate-of-the-art reference scheme, time sharing is used between the two MSs,\nwhile each MS is served through a two-way relaying scheme. The results indicate\nthat, when the RS operates in a DF mode, the achievable rate regions are\nsignificantly enlarged. On the other hand, for AF relaying, the gains are\nrather modest. The practical implication of the presented work is a novel\ninsight on how to improve the spatial reuse in wireless cellular networks by\ncoordinating the transmissions of the antipodal relays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 04:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}

The nature\nof the escaping process of photons from these early galaxies is crucial to\nunderstanding galaxy evolution and the cosmic reionization. Here, we\ninvestigate the escape of Lya, non-ionizing UV-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600\nangstrom in rest frame), and ionizing photons (l < 912 angstrom) from galaxies\nby combining a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensional\nmulti-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. The galaxies are simulated in\na box of 5^3 h^-3 Mpc^3 with high resolutions using the Aquila initial\ncondition which reproduces a Milky Way-like galaxy at redshift z=0. We find\nthat the escape fraction (fesc) of these different photons shows a complex\ndependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(Lya) and fesc(UV) appear to\nevolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxy\nproperties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, while\nfesc(Ion) remains roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does not\nshow clear dependence on galaxy properties. fesc(Lya) correlates more strongly\nwith fesc(UV) than with fesc(Ion). In addition, we find a relation between the\nemergent Lya luminosity and the ionizing photon emissivity of Lyman Alpha\nEmitters (LAEs). By combining this relation with the observed luminosity\nfunctions of LAEs at different redshift, we estimate the contribution from LAEs\nto the reionization of intergalactic medium (IGM). Our result suggests that\nionizing photons from LAEs alone are not sufficient to ionize IGM at z > 6, but\nthey can maintain the ionization of IGM at z ~ 0 - 5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 06:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 15:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

As an expedient way for the reliable but massive GWA,\nQuasi-Particle-LDA (QPLDA) is proposed by several authors, where the total\ncomputational cost scales with N. Historically, Sham and Kohn introduced the\nidea of the local mass operator based on local wavenumber similar to WKB, but\ndid not execute actual numerical calculations. They took into account exchange\ninteraction only, from which we could not expect precise treatments anyway.\nLater, Pickett and Wang had proposed a more qualitative method and had shown\nits potentiality in examples of semiconductors, such as silicon, diamond and\nGaP. They used a model analytic formula for the dialectic function and adopted\na model energy dispersion, which is free-electron like one, except that, being\naccompanied with an artificial band-gap discontinuity. The latter method has\ntwo shortcomings. First, to execute the calculation, several parameters are\nneeded, such as the macroscopic dielectric constant and the band gap, which\nshould be evaluated by the calculation itself, rather than being prepared as\nparameters. Second, in their computation of the mass operator, two or three\ndimensional numerical integrations are needed on each point of the direct space\nmesh, which demand large computational costs in iterative procedures in\ndetermining local wavenumbers and quasi-particle energies. This may be the\nreason why QPLDA has not been widely used until now. The present work proposes\na qualitative way of QPLDA which does not need any experimental parameters,\nbeing much speedier than the formalism of Picket and Wang, and more precise\nthan that of Sham and Kohn. The computational method adopted by the present\nwork is a modification of the original proposal by Sham and Kohn, rather than\nthat of Picket and Wang.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 07:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 04:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-23"}

Statistically equivalent causal or\ndirected graphical models are said to belong to a Markov equivalent class. It\nis of great interest to describe and understand the space of such classes.\nHowever, with currently known algorithms, sampling over such classes is only\nfeasible for graphs with fewer than approximately 20 vertices. In this paper,\nwe design reversible irreducible Markov chains on the space of Markov\nequivalent classes by proposing a perfect set of operators that determine the\ntransitions of the Markov chain. The stationary distribution of a proposed\nMarkov chain has a closed form and can be computed easily. Specifically, we\nconstruct a concrete perfect set of operators on sparse Markov equivalence\nclasses by introducing appropriate conditions on each possible operator.\nAlgorithms and their accelerated versions are provided to efficiently generate\nMarkov chains and to explore properties of Markov equivalence classes of sparse\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs) with thousands of vertices. We find\nexperimentally that in most Markov equivalence classes of sparse DAGs, (1) most\nedges are directed, (2) most undirected subgraphs are small and (3) the number\nof these undirected subgraphs grows approximately linearly with the number of\nvertices.

The\nthermodynamic response of the gas can be characterized by an effective equation\nof state. It determines how gas heats up or cools as it gets compressed, and\nhence plays a key role in regulating the process of stellar birth on virtually\nall scales, ranging from individual star clusters up to the galaxy as a whole.\nWe present a systematic study of the impact of thermodynamics on gravitational\ncollapse in the context of high-redshift star formation, but argue that our\nfindings are also relevant for present-day star formation in molecular clouds.\n  We consider a polytropic equation of state, P = k rho^Gamma, with both\nsub-isothermal exponents Gamma < 1 and super-isothermal exponents Gamma > 1. We\nfind significant differences between these two cases. For Gamma > 1, pressure\ngradients slow down the contraction and lead to the formation of a virialized,\nturbulent core. Weak magnetic fields are strongly tangled and efficiently\namplified via the small-scale turbulent dynamo on timescales corresponding to\nthe eddy-turnover time at the viscous scale. For Gamma < 1, on the other hand,\npressure support is not sufficient for the formation of such a core.\nGravitational contraction proceeds much more rapidly and the flow develops very\nstrong shocks, creating a network of intersecting sheets and extended\nfilaments. The resulting magnetic field lines are very coherent and exhibit a\nconsiderable degree of order. Nevertheless, even under these conditions we\nstill find exponential growth of the magnetic energy density in the kinematic\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 08:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-12"}

The\nfirst one states that every sequence of equivalence classes of vortices over\nthe plane has a subsequence that converges to a new type of genus zero stable\nmap, provided that the energies of the vortices are uniformly bounded. Such a\nstable map consists of equivalence classes of vortices over the plane and\nholomorphic spheres in the symplectic quotient. The second main result is that\nthe vertical differential of the vortex equations over the plane (at the level\nof gauge equivalence) is a Fredholm operator of a specified index.\n  Potentially the quantum Kirwan map can be used to compute the quantum\ncohomology of symplectic quotients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 08:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 01:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-28"}

This source is the first NLS1 detected at\nenergies above 100 MeV and therefore can be considered the prototype of this\nemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN). The\nobservations performed from 2008 August 1 to 2011 December 31 confirmed that\nPMN J0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop an\nisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the level\nof powerful quasars. The evolution of the radiation emission of this source in\n2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, with\ncorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emission\nafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in the\nlight curves of 2011. The comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including\n2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectral\nslope. We selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling the\nbroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or very\nlow/high flux at other wavelengths. The observed variability can largely be\nexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk Lorentz factor of\nthe jet or the electron spectrum. The characteristic time scale of\ndoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on the\nfrequency and the sampling rate. The shortest doubling time scale at gamma-rays\nis 2.3+-0.5 days. These small values underline the need of highly-sampled\nmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 08:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Indeed, operators with smooth coefficients can\napproximate those with non-smooth ones. For geometric inverse problems, we can\nencounter a similar phenomenon: to understand stability of the solution of\ninverse problems for smooth manifolds, we should study the question of\nuniqueness for the limiting non-smooth case.

The algorithm stems from a level-set\napproach that computes the reachable set of the system, i.e., the collection of\nstates reachable from a certain initial condition via the computation of the\nvalue function of an optimal control problem. The discrete-time vehicle model\nis one of a particular class of hybrid vehicles, namely, range extender\nelectric vehicles (REEV). This kind of hybridization departures from a full\nelectric vehicle that has an additional module -- the range extender (RE) -- as\nan extra energy source in addition to its main energy source -- a high voltage\nbattery. As an important feature, our model allows for the switching on and off\nof the range extender and includes a decision lag constraint, i.e., imposes two\nconsecutive switches to be separated by a positive time interval. The approach\nconsists in the introduction of an adequate optimal control problem with lag\nconstraints on the switch control whose value function allows a\ncharacterization of the reachable set. The value function is in turn\ncharacterized by a dynamic programming algorithm. This algorithm is implemented\nand some numerical examples are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 13:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}

Some fraction of these objects may\nhave died as pair-instability supernovae or gamma-ray bursts. The winds if\nthese stars may have played an important role in determining these outcomes. As\nthe winds are driven by radiation pressure on spectral lines, their strengths\nare expected to vary with metallicity. Until now, most mass-loss predictions\nfor metal-poor O-type stars have assumed a scaled-down solar-abundance pattern.\nHowever, Population III evolutionary tracks show significant surface enrichment\nthrough rotational mixing of CNO-processed material, because even metal-poor\nstars switch to CNO-burning early on. We address the question of whether the\nCNO surface enhanced self-enrichment in the first few generations of stars\ncould impact their mass-loss properties. For this, we employ Monte Carlo\nsimulations to establish the local line-force and solve for the momentum\nequation of the stellar outflow, testing whether an outflow can actually be\nestablished by assessing the net acceleration at the sonic point of the flow.\nStellar evolution models of rotating metal-poor stars are used to specify the\nsurface chemical composition, focussing on the phases of early enrichment. We\nfind that the mass-loss rates of CNO enhanced metal-poor stars are higher than\nthose of non-enriched stars, but they are much lower than those rates where the\nCNO abundance is included in the total abundance Z. We present a heuristic\nformula that provides mass-loss estimates for CNO-dominated winds in relation\nto scaled-down solar abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 13:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

By\nthe end of 2010, another kind of new superconductor, the Fe-based chalcogenide\nK1-xFe2-ySe2 was discovered. A naive counting of the electrons in the system\nwould lead to a conclusion that the system is heavily electron overdoped (~0.4\ne/Fe). Band structure calculations further support this speculation and predict\nthat the hole pockets which are found in the iron pnictides may be missing.\nThis greatly challenges the widely perceived picture that the superconducting\npairing is established by exchanging anti-ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and\nthe electrons are scattered between the electron and hole pockets. Later, it\nwas found that both potassium and iron might be deficient in K1-xFe2-ySe2,\nyielding to a picture of phase separation. In this picture the superconducting\nphase and the antiferromagnetic (AF) phase may phase separate spatially into\ndifferent regions. This generates further curiosity about what is the real\nsuperconducting phase, what is the relationship between the superconducting\nphase and the AF phase, and what is the parent state for the superconducting\nphase. We propose a \"spider web\" model for the phase separation, which can\nexplain both the transport and magnetic data. In this paper, we review the\nstatus of research in this rapidly growing field and list the important and\nunsettled issues as perspectives for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 14:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-18"}

In this way, one can study the crossover from nonergodic to ergodic\nphase, as the size of the free region grows and the effect of the confinement\nfades. Such crossover defines the so-called point-to-set correlation length,\nwhich has been measured in a spherical geometry, or cavity. Here, we make\nfurther progress in the study ofcorrelations under amorphous boundary\nconditions by analyzing the equilibrium properties of a glass-forming liquid,\nconfined in a planar (\"sandwich\") geometry. The mobile particles are subject to\namorphous boundary conditions with the particles in the surrounding walls\nfrozen into their low temperature equilibrium configurations. Compared to the\ncavity, the sandwich geometry has three main advantages: i) the width of the\nsandwich is decoupled from its longitudinal size, making the thermodynamic\nlimit possible; ii) for very large width, the behaviour off a single wall can\nbe studied; iii) we can use \"anti-parallel\" boundary conditions to force a\ndomain wall and measure its excess energy. Our results confirm that amorphous\nboundary conditions are indeed a very useful new tool inthe study of static\nproperties of glass-forming liquids, but also raise some warning about the fact\nthat not all correlation functions that can be calculated in this framework\ngive the same qualitative results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 14:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Is this a noteworthy instance of a rule\nwhich, generated by an improper simplification of Maxwell-JJ Thomson\nformulation, is in fact physically untenable but, this notwithstanding, highly\nsuccessful. Modelling of electromagnetic fields and fluxes in spacetime\nrespectively as even and odd spatial differential forms and the formulation of\ninduction laws by means of exterior and Lie derivatives, make their covariance\nmanifest under any smooth spacetime transformations, contrary to the usual\naffirmation in literature which confines this property to relativistic\nframe-changes. A remarkable consequence is that there is no entanglement\nbetween electric and magnetic fields and fluxes under special relativity\ntransformations. In particular, relativistic support to Lorentz force rule is\nthus deactivated. For translational motions of charged bodies immersed in a\nuniform and constant magnetic field, the induced electric field in such a\nframe, is equal to one half the Lorentz force term.

The goal of\nthe optimized scheme proposed here is to enable experimental simplification and\nperformance improvement. The core of the scheme is composed by soft and hard\nX-ray self-seeding setups. Based on the use of an improved design for both\nmonochromators it is possible to increase the design electron energy up to 17.5\nGeV in photon energy range between 2 keV and 13 keV, which is the most\npreferable for life science experiments. An advantage of operating at such high\nelectron energy is the increase of the X-ray output peak power. Another\nadvantage is that 17.5 GeV is the preferred operation energy for SASE1 and\nSASE2 beamline users. Since it will be necessary to run all the XFEL lines at\nthe same electron energy, this choice will reduce the interference with other\nundulator lines and increase the total amount of scheduled beam time. In this\nwork we also propose a study of the performance of the self-seeding scheme\naccounting for spatiotemporal coupling caused by the use of a single crystal\nmonochromator. Our analysis indicates that this distortion is easily suppressed\nby the right choice of diamond crystal planes and that the proposed undulator\nsource yields about the same performance as in the case for a X-ray seed pulse\nwith no coupling.

The radiant at RA\n+$18\\degree$ and Dec +$56\\degree$ is typical of the `classical' Andromedids of\nthe early 1800's, whose radiant was actually in Cassiopeia. The orbital\nelements indicate that the material involved was released before 3D/Biela's\nbreakup prior to 1846. The observed shower in 2011 had a slow geocentric speed\n(16 km s$^{-1}$) and was comprised of small particles: the mean measured mass\nfrom the radar is $\\sim5 \\times 10^{-7}$ kg corresponding to radii of 0.5 mm at\na bulk density of 1000 kg/m$^3$.\n  Numerical simulations of the parent comet indicate that the meteoroids of the\n2011 return of the Andromedids shower were primarily ejected during 3D/Biela's\n1649 perihelion passage.

Through\ncompletely opportunistic use of the camera on the phone and other sensors,\nPlaceRaider constructs rich, three dimensional models of indoor environments.\nRemote burglars can thus download the physical space, study the environment\ncarefully, and steal virtual objects from the environment (such as financial\ndocuments, information on computer monitors, and personally identifiable\ninformation). Through two human subject studies we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of using mobile devices as powerful surveillance and virtual\ntheft platforms, and we suggest several possible defenses against visual\nmalware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 15:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}

The\nsystem has an O(3) quantum critical point (QCP) separating the magnetically\nordered and the magnetically disordered phases. We demonstrate that nearly\ncritical quantum magnetic fluctuations can change the Fermi surface topology\nand also lead to spin charge separation (SCS) in two dimensions. We demonstrate\nthat in the physically interesting regime there is a magnetically driven\nLifshitz point (LP) inside the magnetically disordered phase. At the LP the\ntopology of the hole Fermi surface is changed. The position of the LP, while\nbeing close to the position of the QCP is generally different. Dependent on the\nadditional hole hopping integrals $t^{\\prime}$ and $t^{\\prime\\prime}$, the LP\ncan be located either in the magnetically ordered phase and/or in the\nmagnetically disordered phase. We also demonstrate that in this regime the hole\nspin and charge necessarily separate when approaching the QCP. The considered\nmodel sheds light on generic problems concerning the physics of the cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 01:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-27"}

To interpret existing multi-wavelength\nobservations, we made dynamical simulations of the Taffy system including a\nsticky particle component. To compare simulation snapshots to HI and CO\nobservations, we assume that the molecular fraction of the gas depends on the\nsquare root of the gas volume density. For the comparison of our simulations\nwith observations of polarized radio continuum emission, we calculated the\nevolution of the 3D large-scale magnetic field for our simulations. The\ninduction equations including the time-dependent gas-velocity fields from the\ndynamical model were solved for this purpose. Our simulations reproduce the\nstellar distribution of the primary galaxy, UGC 12914, the prominent HI and CO\ngas bridge, the offset between the CO and HI emission in the bridge, the bridge\nisovelocity vectors parallel to the bridge, the HI double-line profiles in the\nbridge region, the large line-widths (~200 km/s) in the bridge region, the high\nfield strength of the bridge large-scale regular magnetic field, the projected\nmagnetic field vectors parallel to the bridge and the strong total power radio\ncontinuum emission from the bridge. The stellar distribution of the secondary\nmodel galaxy is more perturbed than observed. The observed distortion of the HI\nenvelope of the Taffy system is not reproduced by our simulations which use\ninitially symmetric gas disks. The model allows us to define the bridge region\nin three dimensions. We estimate the total bridge gas mass (HI, warm and cold\nH2) to be 5 to 6 10^9 M_sun, with a molecular fraction M_H2/M_HI of about unity\n(abrigded).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 11:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
