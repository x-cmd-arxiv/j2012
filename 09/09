In this paper we\nconsider the delay variations as unknown and study robustness of nominal\nconstant-delay predictor feedbacks under delay variations that depend on time\nand the state. We show that when the delay perturbation and its rate have\nsufficiently small magnitude, the local asymptotic stability of the closed-loop\nsystem, under the nominal predictor-based design, is preserved. For the special\ncase of linear systems, and under only time-varying delay perturbations, we\nprove robustness of global exponential stability of the predictor feedback when\nthe delay perturbation and its rate are small in any one of four different\nmetrics. We present two examples, one that is concerned with the control of a\nDC motor through a network and one of a bilateral teleoperation between two\nrobotic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2012 16:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

For a large range of temperatures\nabove Tc ~ 210, K, where dynamic polar correlations exist, acoustic phonons\npropagating along [1\\bar{1}0] and polarized along [110] (TA2 phonons) are\noverdamped and softened across most of the Brillouin zone. By contrast,\nacoustic phonons propagating along [100] and polarized along [001] (TA1\nphonons) are overdamped and softened for only a limited range of wavevectors.\nThe anisotropy and temperature dependence of the acoustic phonon energy\nlinewidth are directly correlated with the elastic diffuse scattering,\nindicating that polar nanoregions are the cause of the anomalous behavior. The\ndamping and softening vanish for q -> 0, i.e. for long-wavelength acoustic\nphonons, which supports the notion that the anomalous damping is a result of\nthe coupling between the relaxational component of the diffuse scattering and\nthe harmonic TA phonons. Therefore, these effects are not due to large changes\nin the elastic constants with temperature because the elastic constants\ncorrespond to the long-wavelength limit. We compare the elastic constants we\nmeasure to those from Brillouin scattering and to values reported for pure PT.\nWe show that while the values of C44 are quite similar, those for C11 and C12\nare significantly less in PMN and result in a softening of (C11-C12) over PT.\nThere is also an increased elastic anisotropy (2C44/(C11-C12)) versus that in\nPT. These results suggest an instability to TA2 acoustic fluctuations in\nrelaxors. We discuss our results in the context of the debate over the\n\"waterfall\" effect and show that they are inconsistent with TA-TO phonon\ncoupling or other models that invoke the presence of a second optic mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2012 17:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The data matched the predicted trend well for 3 different liquids\nused as suspensions; however, at extreme values of drop radius, there was a\nsignificant deviation from prediction.

The uncertainty\nprinciple leads to the partial indistinguishability and coherence of closely\nlocated emitters that affect the observed femtoscopy scales. In thermal systems\nthe role of corresponding coherent length is taken by the thermal de Broglie\nwavelength that also defines the size of a single emitter. The formalism of\npartially coherent phases in the amplitudes of closely located individual\nemitters is used for the quantitative analysis. The general approach is\nillustrated analytically for the case of the Gaussian approximation for\nemitting sources. A reduction of the interferometry radii and a suppression of\nthe Bose-Einstein correlation functions for small sources due to the\nuncertainty principle are found. There is a positive correlation between the\nsource size and the intercept of the correlation function. The peculiarities of\nthe non-femtoscopic correlations caused by minijets and fluctuations of the\ninitial states of the systems formed in $pp$ and $e^+e^-$ collisions are also\nanalyzed. The factorization property for the contributions of femtoscopic and\nnon-femtoscopic correlations into complete correlation function is observed in\nnumerical calculations in a wide range of the model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2012 20:04:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 14:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2013 13:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 11 May 2013 12:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-29"}

Our relations are based on a\nlarge set of well studied low-mass stars in the field and on a set of benchmark\nlow-mass eclipsing binaries. The relations link the amount by which an active\nobject's temperature is suppressed, and its radius inflated, to the strength of\nits Halpha emission. These relations are found to approximately preserve\nbolometric luminosity. We apply these relations to the peculiar brown-dwarf\neclipsing binary 2M0535-05, in which the active, higher-mass brown dwarf has a\ncooler temperature than its inactive, lower-mass companion.

This is because, magnetic field by\nremoving angular momentum focusses the flow in a compact region. This makes the\nradiative feedback very efficient leading to a significant increase of the\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2012 09:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

However, in some scenarios, the cost matrix is uncertain during\ntraining, and re-train a classifier after the cost matrix is specified would\nnot be an option. For binary classification, this issue can be successfully\naddressed by methods maximizing the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric.\nSince the AUC can measure performance of base classifiers independent of cost\nduring training, and a larger AUC is more likely to lead to a smaller total\ncost in testing using the threshold moving method. As an extension of AUC to\nmulti-class problems, MAUC has attracted lots of attentions and been widely\nused. Although MAUC also measures performance of base classifiers independent\nof cost, it is unclear whether a larger MAUC of classifiers is more likely to\nlead to a smaller total cost. In fact, it is also unclear what kinds of\npost-processing methods should be used in multi-class problems to convert base\nclassifiers into discrete classifiers such that the total cost is as small as\npossible. In the paper, we empirically explore the relationship between MAUC\nand the total cost of classifiers by applying two categories of post-processing\nmethods.

As WMNs become an increasingly popular\nreplacement technology for last-mile connectivity to the home networking,\ncommunity and neighborhood networking, it is imperative to design efficient and\nsecure communication protocols for these networks. However, several\nvulnerabilities exist in currently existing protocols for WMNs. These security\nloopholes can be exploited by potential attackers to launch attack on WMNs. The\nabsence of a central point of administration makes securing WMNs even more\nchallenging. The broadcast nature of transmission and the dependency on the\nintermediate nodes for multi-hop communications lead to several security\nvulnerabilities in WMNs. The attacks can be external as well as internal in\nnature. External attacks are launched by intruders who are not authorized users\nof the network. For example, an intruding node may eavesdrop on the packets and\nreplay those packets at a later point of time to gain access to the network\nresources. On the other hand, the internal attacks are launched by the nodes\nthat are part of the WMN. On example of such attack is an intermediate node\ndropping packets which it was supposed to forward.

We prove the first non-trivial lower error bounds for randomized\nalgorithms in these cost models and demonstrate their quality in the case of\nproduct weights. In particular, we show that the randomized changing dimension\nalgorithms provided in [L. Plaskota, G. W. Wasilkowski, J. Complexity 27\n(2011), 505--518] achieve convergence rates arbitrarily close to the optimal\nconvergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2012 15:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}
