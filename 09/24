This\nensemble is based on lifting different subcodes of a linear code to the\nEuclidean space using Construction A. In addition to being simpler, our\nanalysis is less sensitive to the assumption that the additive noise is\nGaussian. In particular, for additive ergodic noise channels it is shown that\nthe achievable rates of the nested lattice coding scheme depend on the noise\ndistribution only via its power.

This hypothesis pictures a black hole equilibrium as an, overall pure,\nstate, with given energy, consisting of a black hole with its (mostly matter)\natmosphere in a box and identifies the black hole's entropy with the pure\nstate's matter-gravity entanglement entropy. We assume this equilibrium goes\nover, at weak string-coupling, to a pure state with similar energy consisting\nof a long string with a stringy atmosphere and that the matter-gravity\nentanglement entropy goes over to the entanglement entropy between\n(approximately) the long string and the stringy atmosphere. We also recall\nrecent work (in a non-gravitational context) towards modern foundations for\nthermodynamics, where, in place of a total microcanonical ensemble, one assumes\nthat a total system, consisting of a small (sub)system and an energy bath, is\nin a (random) pure state with energy in a given narrow range and shows that the\nsmall subsystem will then find itself in a thermal state.

The flux--density level of\nsuccessive giant pulses fluctuates rapidly and their occurrence rates within a\nday's observations as well as between neighboring days show large variations.\nWhile on some days PSR B0950+08 shows a large number of giant pulses, there are\nother days when it shows only \"quasi-nulls\" with no detectable emission in the\npower spectrum or in the folded pulse data. The cumulative intensity\ndistribution of these giant pulses appears to follow a power law, with index\n-2.2.

We use a\nMonte Carlo (MC) algorithm to yield robust analysis of the statistical\nsignificance of cycle detections and non-detections. None of the 9 stellar\nlightcurves show any convincing indications of periodicity. From MC simulations\nwe simulate the detection capabilities of our methodology and, assuming a\nuniform distribution of cycle periods and strengths over the domain searched,\nwe conclude with 95% confidence that less than 72% of the stars represented by\nour sample of active stars have 5-13 year coronal X-ray cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2012 19:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-31"}

In our approach, based on\nour 'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis', 'string entropy' here should be\ninterpreted as the likely entanglement entropy between (approximately) the\nsingle long string and the stringy atmosphere which, as we argue, arise in a\npure multistring state of given energy in a (rescaled) box.

While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental\nto the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently\ncritical to evaluating a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these\nparameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new\nproblem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal\nexperience and intuition in ways that are hard to describe. Since the\nperformance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the\nalgorithm and the details of its tuning, it can be difficult to determine\nwhether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.\n  In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyper\nparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools to replace\nhand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process.

We use a combination of 1.4 and 30 GHz data to select a total of 28\nprobable cluster-member radio galaxies and also to predict their 140 GHz flux\ndensities. All of these galaxies are steep-spectrum radio sources and they are\nfound preferentially in the cool-core clusters within our sample. In\nparticular, 11 of the 12 brightest cluster member radio sources are associated\nwith cool-core systems. Although none of the individual galaxies are robustly\ndetected in the Bolocam data, the ensemble-average flux density at 140 GHz is\nconsistent with, but slightly lower than, the extrapolation from lower\nfrequencies assuming a constant spectral index. In addition, our data indicate\nan intrinsic scatter of 30 percent around the power-law extrapolated flux\ndensities at 140 GHz, although our data do not tightly constrain this scatter.\nFor our cluster sample, which is composed of high-mass and moderate-redshift\nsystems, we find that the maximum fractional change in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\nsignal integrated over any single cluster due to the presence of these radio\nsources is 20 percent, and only 1/4 of the clusters show a fractional change of\nmore than 1 percent. The amount of contamination is strongly dependent on\ncluster morphology, and nearly all of the clusters with more than 1 percent\ncontamination are cool-core systems.

Upon a thorough analysis of the\noptical photometry, we find that all of our targets have ionising ultra-violet\ncontinuum luminosities of logL > 23 W/Hz. We therefore attribute this deficit\nto the traditional optical selection of targets biasing surveys towards the\nmost ultra-violet luminous objects, where the intense radiation excites the\nneutral gas to the point where it cannot engage in star formation. However,\nthis hypothesis does not explain why there is a critical luminosity, rather\nthan a continuum where the detections gradually become fewer and fewer as the\nharshness of the radiation increases. We show that by placing a quasar within a\ngalaxy of gas there is always a finite ultra-violet luminosity above which all\nof the gas is ionised.

We analyze how the gap structure changes if we include into\nthe consideration the hybridization between the two electron pockets (the\ninter-pocket hopping term with momentum (pi,pi,pi). We derive the hybridization\nterm and relate it to the absence of inversion symmetry in the Fe-plane because\nof two non-equivalent locations of pnictogen (chalcogen) above and below the\nplane. We find that the hybridization tends to eliminate the nodes -- as it\nincreases, the pairs of neighboring nodes approach each other, merge and\ndisappear once the hybridization exceeds a certain threshold. The nodes\ndisappear first around k_z =pi/2, and vertical line nodes split into two\nvertical loops centered at k_z =0 and k_z = pi. We also show that the\nhybridization moves the nodes along the loops away from the normal state Fermi\nsurfaces.

For helium, a long-standing\nexperimental-theoretical discrepancy for P states motivates a reevaluation of\nthe higher-order terms which follow from relativistic quantum theory and\nquantum electrodynamics (QED). The tensor structure of relativistic corrections\ninvolves scalar, vector, and symmetric and anti-symmetric tensor components.

For the relativistic corrections,\nthis leads to a verification of previous results obtained using the\nWigner-Eckhart theorem. The same method, applied to the radiative correction\n(Bethe logarithm term) leads to a spin-dependent correction which is different\nfor singlet versus triplet P states.

If the injection fraction of cosmic-ray (CR)\nparticles is greater than 2x10^{-4}, for the shock parameters relevant for\nyoung supernova remnants, DSA is efficient enough to develop a significant\nshock precursor due to CR feedback, and magnetic field can be amplified up to a\nfactor of 20 via CR streaming instability in the upstream region. If scattering\ncenters drift with Alfven speed in the amplified magnetic field, the CR energy\nspectrum can be steepened significantly and the acceleration efficiency is\nreduced. Nonlinear DSA with self-consistent MFA and Alfvenic drift predicts\nthat the postshock CR pressure saturates roughly at 10 % of the shock ram\npressure for strong shocks with a sonic Mach number ranging 20< M_s< 100. Since\nthe amplified magnetic field follows the flow modification in the precursor,\nthe low energy end of the particle spectrum is softened much more than the high\nenergy end. As a result, the concave curvature in the energy spectra does not\ndisappear entirely even with the help of Alfvenic drift. For shocks with a\nmoderate Alfven Mach number (M_A<10), the accelerated CR spectrum can become as\nsteep as E^{-2.1}-E^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed CR\nspectrum and gamma-ray photon spectrum of several young supernova remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 09:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We optimize APSK\nconstellations with 4, 8, and 16 points in terms of symbol error probability\n(SEP) under TS detection for several combinations of input power and fiber\nlength. Our results show that APSK is a promising modulation format in order to\ncope with NLPN. As an example, for 16 points, performance gains of 3.2 dB can\nbe achieved at a SEP of 10^-2 compared to 16-QAM by choosing an optimized APSK\nconstellation. We also demonstrate that in the presence of severe nonlinear\ndistortions, it may become beneficial to sacrifice a constellation point or an\nentire constellation ring to reduce the average SEP. Finally, we discuss the\nproblem of selecting a good binary labeling for the found constellations. For\nthe class of rectangular APSK a labeling design method is proposed, resulting\nin near-optimal bit error probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 10:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 06:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

Patterns of\nisolation-by-distance are usually caused by local spatial dispersal, which\nexplains why differences of allele frequencies between populations accumulate\nwith distance. However, spatial variations of demographic parameters such as\nmigration rate or population density can generate non-stationary patterns of\nisolation-by-distance where the rate at which genetic differentiation\naccumulates varies across space. To characterize non-stationary patterns of\nisolation-by-distance, we infer local genetic differentiation based on Bayesian\nkriging. Local genetic differentiation for a sampled population is defined as\nthe average genetic differentiation between the sampled population and fictive\nneighboring populations. To avoid defining populations in advance, the method\ncan also be applied at the scale of individuals making it relevant for\nlandscape genetics. Inference of local genetic differentiation relies on a\nmatrix of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity between populations or\nindividuals such as matrices of FST between pairs of populations. Simulation\nstudies show that maps of local genetic differentiation can reveal barriers to\ngene flow but also other patterns such as continuous variations of gene flow\nacross habitat. The potential of the method is illustrated with 2 data sets:\ngenome-wide SNP data for human Swedish populations and AFLP markers for alpine\nplant species.

Using ABPS, a mobile node can seamlessly switch to a different NIC in\norder to get better performance, without causing communication interruptions at\nthe application level. To make this possible, NICs are kept always active and a\nsoftware monitor constantly probes the channels for available access points.\nWhile this ensures maximum connection availability, considerable energy may be\nwasted when no access points are available for a given NIC. In this paper we\naddress this issue by investigating the use of an \"oracle\" able to provide\ninformation on network availability.

To solve this problem\neffectively, we first reformulate it as a convex semi-infinite programming\n(SIP) problem and then propose an efficient \\emph{feature generating paradigm}.\nIn contrast with traditional gradient-based approaches that conduct\noptimization on all input features, the proposed method iteratively activates a\ngroup of features and solves a sequence of multiple kernel learning (MKL)\nsubproblems of much reduced scale. To further speed up the training, we propose\nto solve the MKL subproblems in their primal forms through a modified\naccelerated proximal gradient approach. Due to such an optimization scheme,\nsome efficient cache techniques are also developed. The feature generating\nparadigm can guarantee that the solution converges globally under mild\nconditions and achieve lower feature selection bias. Moreover, the proposed\nmethod can tackle two challenging tasks in feature selection: 1) group-based\nfeature selection with complex structures and 2) nonlinear feature selection\nwith explicit feature mappings. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of\nsynthetic and real-world datasets containing tens of million data points with\n$O(10^{14})$ features demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed\nmethod over state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of\ngeneralization performance and training efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 13:23:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 15:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

We have found mainly two\ntypes of oscillations from February to April in 2007. One type is found at loop\nfootpoint regions, with a dominant period around 10 minutes. They are\ncharacterized by coherent behavior of all line parameters (line intensity,\nDoppler shift, line width and profile asymmetry), apparent blue shift and\nblueward asymmetry throughout almost the en- tire duration. Such oscillations\nare likely to be signatures of quasi-periodic upflows (small-scale jets, or\ncoronal counterpart of type-II spicules), which may play an important role in\nthe supply of mass and energy to the hot corona. The other type of oscillation\nis usually associated with the upper part of loops. They are most clearly seen\nin the Doppler shift of coronal lines with forma- tion temperatures between one\nand two million degrees. The global wavelets of these oscillations usually peak\nsharply around a period in the range of 3-6 minutes. No obvious profile\nasymmetry is found and the variation of the line width is typically very small.\nThe intensity variation is often less than 2%. These oscillations are more\nlikely to be signatures of kink/Alfven waves rather than flows. In a few cases\nthere seems to be a pi/2 phase shift between the intensity and Doppler shift\noscillations, which may suggest the presence of slow mode standing waves\naccording to wave theories. However, we demonstrate that such a phase shift\ncould also be produced by loops moving into and out of a spatial pixel as a\nresult of Alfvenic oscillations. In this scenario, the intensity oscillations\nassociated with Alfvenic waves are caused by loop displacement rather than\ndensity change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 14:52:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-31"}

An important\naspect of cytoskeletal assemblies is their dynamic nature, which allows\nremodeling in response to external cues. The reversible nature of crosslink\nbinding is an important mechanism that underlies these dynamical processes.\nHere, we develop a theoretical model that provides insight into how the\nmechanical properties of cytoskeletal networks may depend on their underlying\nconstituting elements. We incorporate three important ingredients: nonaffine\nfilament deformations in response to network strain; interplay between filament\nand crosslink mechanical properties; reversible crosslink (un)binding in\nresponse to imposed stress. With this we are able to self-consistently\ncalculate the nonlinear modulus of the network as a function of deformation\namplitude and crosslink as well as filament stiffnesses. During loading\ncrosslink unbinding processes lead to a relaxation of stress and therefore to a\nreduction of the network modulus and eventually to network failure, when all\ncrosslink are unbound. This softening due to crosslink unbinding generically\ncompetes with an inherent stiffening response, which may either be due to\nfilament or crosslink nonlinear elasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 14:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-09"}

For densities greater than about half nuclear matter saturation\ndensity \\rho_0, the contributions to the Fermi liquid parameters from the\nleading-order chiral three-nucleon force scale in all cases approximately\nlinearly with the nucleon density. The largest effect of the three-nucleon\nforce is to generate a strongly repulsive effective interaction in the\nisotropic spin-independent channel. We show that the leading-order chiral\nthree-nucleon force leads to an increase in the spin susceptibility of neutron\nmatter, but we observe no evidence for a ferromagnetic spin instability in the\nvicinity of the saturation density \\rho_0. This work sets the foundation for\nfuture studies of neutron matter response to weak and electromagnetic probes\nwith applications to neutron star structure and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 15:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

With an approach based on\nlinear perturbation theory we describe the evolution of the mode amplitude and\nfollow the trajectory of a newborn neutron star through its instability window.\nThe influence on the f-mode instability of the magnetic field and the presence\nof an unstable r-mode is also considered. Two different configurations are\nstudied in more detail; an N = 1 polytrope with a typical mass and radius and a\nmore massive polytropic N = 0.62 model with gravitational mass M = 1.98 Msun.\nWe study several evolutions with different initial rotation rates and\ntemperature and determine the gravitational waves radiated during the\ninstability.

Here, we make\nthe connection between Abelian as well as non-Abelian FQH states and FCIs more\nprecise. Using a gauge-fixed version of Qi's Wannier basis representation of a\nChern band, we demonstrate that the interpolation between several FCI states,\nobtained by short-range lattice interactions in a spin-orbit-coupled kagome\nlattice model, and the corresponding continuum FQH states is smooth: the gap\nremains approximately constant and extrapolates to a finite value in the\nthermodynamic limit, while the low-lying part of the orbital entanglement\nspectrum remains qualitatively unaltered. The orbital entanglement spectra also\nprovide a first glimpse of the edge physics of FCIs via the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence. Corroborating these results, we find that the squared overlaps\nbetween the FCI and FQH ground states are as large as 98.7% for the 8-electron\nLaughlin state at $\\nu=1/3$ (consistent with an earlier study) and 97.8% for\nthe 10-electron Moore-Read state at $\\nu=1/2$.

This facility\nhas two main purposes: push the limits of the photoinjectors performances\nworking on both the design and the associated technology and provide a low\nenergy (MeV) short pulses (ps) electron beam for the interested users. Another\nvery important goal of this machine will be to provide an opportunity to form\naccelerator physics students, working in a high technology environment. To\nachieve this goal a test line was realised equipped with an RF source, magnets\nand beam diagnostics. In this article we will desrcibe the PHIL beamline and\nits characteristics together with the description of the first two\nphotoinjector realised in LAL and tested: the ALPHAX and the PHIN RF Guns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 10:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In particular, we present a comparative study in\nterms of the spacetime dimension $d$ and the displacement of critical points\ncontrolling the transition between the small and the large black holes. Such\nbehaviors vary nicely in terms of $d$. Among our result in this context\nconsists in showing that the equation of state for a charged RN-AdS black hole\npredicts an universal number given by $\\frac{2d-5}{4d-8}$.
