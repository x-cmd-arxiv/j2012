This\npaper provides an affirmative answer to this question of essential importance\nto the protein's functions. On the basis of the chemical-potential profile of\nglycerol from the extracellular bulk region, throughout PfAQP's conducting\nchannel, to the cytoplasmic bulk region, this study shows the existence of a\nbound state of glycerol inside aquaglyceroporin's permeation pore, from which\nthe dissociation constant is approximately 14 microM. A glycerol molecule\noccupying the bound state occludes the conducting pore through which permeating\nmolecules line up in single file by hydrogen-bonding with one another and with\nthe luminal residues of aquaglyceroporin. In this way, glycerol inhibits\npermeation of water and other permeants through aquaglyceroporin. The\nbiological implications of this theory are discussed and shown to agree with\nthe existent in vitro data. It turns out that the structure of aquaglyceroporin\nis perfect for the van der Waals interactions between the protein and glycerol\nto cause the existence of the bound state deep inside the conducting pore and,\nthus, to play an unexpected but significant role in aquaglyceroporin's\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2012 17:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

Most of this noise is explained by a nonlinear\nwave-wave interaction mechanism, and takes the form of surface gravity waves,\nacoustic or seismic waves. Previous theoretical works on seismic noise focused\non surface (Rayleigh) waves, and did not consider finite depth effects on the\ngenerating wave kinematics. These finite depth effects are introduced here,\nwhich requires the consideration of the direct wave-induced pressure at the\nocean bottom, a contribution previously overlooked in the context of seismic\nnoise. That contribution can lead to a considerable reduction of the seismic\nnoise source, which is particularly relevant for noise periods larger than 10\ns. The theory is applied to acoustic waves in the atmosphere, extending\nprevious theories that were limited to vertical propagation only. Finally, the\nnoise generation theory is also extended beyond the domain of Rayleigh waves,\ngiving the first quantitative expression for sources of seismic body waves. In\nthe limit of slow phase speeds in the ocean wave forcing, the known and\nwell-verified gravity wave result is obtained, which was previously derived for\nan incompressible ocean. The noise source of acoustic, acoustic-gravity and\nseismic modes are given by a mode-specific amplification of the same\nwave-induced pressure field near the zero wavenumber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2012 19:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 19:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In\nmost of the existing literature, it is assumed that optimal MWQ policy can be\nobtained instantaneously at every time slot. However, this assumption may be\nunrealistic in time varying wireless systems, especially when there is no\nclosed-form MWQ solution and iterative algorithms have to be applied to obtain\nthe optimal solution. This paper investigates the convergence behavior and the\nqueue delay performance of the conventional MWQ iterations in which the channel\nstate information (CSI) and queue state information (QSI) are changing in a\nsimilar timescale as the algorithm iterations. Our results are established by\nstudying the stochastic stability of an equivalent virtual stochastic dynamic\nsystem (VSDS), and an extended Foster-Lyapunov criteria is applied for the\nstability analysis. We derive a closed form delay bound of the wireless network\nin terms of the CSI fading rate and the sensitivity of MWQ policy over CSI and\nQSI. Based on the equivalent VSDS, we propose a novel MWQ iterative algorithm\nwith compensation to improve the tracking performance. We demonstrate that\nunder some mild conditions, the proposed modified MWQ algorithm converges to\nthe optimal MWQ control despite the time-varying CSI and QSI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2012 07:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

A new approach for classification of time series uses\nclassification trees based on shapelets. A shapelet is a subsequence extracted\nfrom one of the time series in the dataset. A disadvantage of this approach is\nthe time required for building the shapelet-based classification tree. The\nsearch for the best shapelet requires examining all subsequences of all lengths\nfrom all time series in the training set.\n  A key goal of this work was to find an evaluation order of the shapelets\nspace which enables fast convergence to an accurate model. The comparative\nanalysis we conducted clearly indicates that a random evaluation order yields\nthe best results. Our empirical analysis of the distribution of high-quality\nshapelets within the shapelets space provides insights into why randomized\nshapelets sampling is superior to alternative evaluation orders.\n  We present an algorithm for randomized model generation for shapelet-based\nclassification that converges extremely quickly to a model with surprisingly\nhigh accuracy after evaluating only an exceedingly small fraction of the\nshapelets space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2012 07:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

Neuronal systems in\ngeneral, and those involved in sleep regulation in particular, are noisy and\nheterogeneous by their nature. It has been shown in various systems that\ncertain levels of noise and diversity can significantly improve signal\nencoding. However, these phenomena, especially the effects of diversity, are\nrarely considered in the models of sleep regulation. The present paper is\nfocused on a neuron-based physiologically motivated model of sleep-wake cycles\nthat proposes a novel mechanism of the homeostatic regulation of sleep based on\nthe dynamics of a wake-promoting neuropeptide orexin. Here this model is\ngeneralized by the introduction of intrinsic diversity and noise in the\norexin-producing neurons in order to study the effect of their presence on the\nsleep-wake cycle. A quantitative measure of the quality of a sleep-wake cycle\nis introduced and used to systematically study the generalized model for\ndifferent levels of noise and diversity. The model is shown to exhibit a clear\ndiversity-induced resonance: that is, the best wake-sleep cycle turns out to\ncorrespond to an intermediate level of diversity at the synapses of the\norexin-producing neurons. On the other hand only a mild evidence of stochastic\nresonance is found when the level of noise is varied. These results show that\ndisorder, especially in the form of quenched diversity, can be a key-element\nfor an efficient or optimal functioning of the homeostatic regulation of the\nsleep-wake cycle. Furthermore, this study provides an example of constructive\nrole of diversity in a neuronal system that can be extended beyond the system\nstudied here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2012 09:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

We envisage the need for a formal model for backward security for RFID\nprotocol designs in shared key settings, since the RFID tags are too\nresource-constrained to support public key settings. However, there has not\nbeen much research on backward security for shared key environment since Serge\nVaudenay in his Asiacrypt 2007 paper showed that perfect backward security is\nimpossible to achieve without public key settings. We propose a Privacy\nPreserving RFID Authentication Protocol for shared key environment, APRAP,\nwhich minimizes the damage caused by secret key exposure using insulated keys.\nEven if a tag's secret key is exposed during an authentication session, forward\nsecurity and 'restricted' backward security of the tag are preserved under our\nassumptions. The notion of 'restricted' backward security is that the adversary\nmisses the protocol transcripts which are needed to update the compromised\nsecret key. Although our definition does not capture perfect backward security,\nit is still suitable for effective implementation as the tags are highly mobile\nin practice. We also provide a formal security model of APRAP.

In order to\nunderstand and manage the network to potentially avoid such abrupt changes, it\nis crucial and challenging to locate where in the network lies the cause of\nsuch delays so that some corresponding actions may be taken. To tackle this\nchallenge, the present paper proposes a simple and novel approach. The proposed\napproach relies only on end-to-end measurements, unlike literature approaches\nthat often require a distributed and possibly complicated monitoring /\nmeasurement infrastructure. Here, the key idea of the proposed approach is to\nmake use of compressed sensing theory to estimate delays on each hop between\nthe two nodes where end-to-end delay measurement is conducted, and infer\ncritical hops that contribute to the abrupt delay increases. To demonstrate its\neffectiveness, the proposed approach is applied to a real network. The results\nare encouraging, showing that the proposed approach is able to locate the hops\nthat have the most significant impact on or contribute the most to abrupt\nincreases on the end-to-end delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2012 15:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

Resistance against illegal tracking,\ncloning, timing, and replay attacks are necessary for a secure RFID\nauthentication scheme. Reader authentication is also necessary to thwart any\nillegal attempt to read the tags. With an objective to design a secure and\nlow-cost RFID authentication protocol, Gene Tsudik proposed a timestamp-based\nprotocol using symmetric keys, named YA-TRAP*. Although YA-TRAP* achieves its\ntarget security properties, it is susceptible to timing attacks, where the\ntimestamp to be sent by the reader to the tag can be freely selected by an\nadversary. Moreover, in YA-TRAP*, reader authentication is not provided, and a\ntag can become inoperative after exceeding its pre-stored threshold timestamp\nvalue. In this paper, we propose two mutual RFID authentication protocols that\naim to improve YA-TRAP* by preventing timing attack, and by providing reader\nauthentication. Also, a tag is allowed to refresh its pre-stored threshold\nvalue in our protocols, so that it does not become inoperative after exceeding\nthe threshold. Our protocols also achieve other security properties like\nforward security, resistance against cloning, replay, and tracking attacks.\nMoreover, the computation and communication costs are kept as low as possible\nfor the tags. It is important to keep the communication cost as low as possible\nwhen many tags are authenticated in batch-mode. By introducing aggregate\nfunction for the reader-to-server communication, the communication cost is\nreduced. We also discuss different possible applications of our protocols. Our\nprotocols thus capture more security properties and more efficiency than\nYA-TRAP*. Finally, we show that our protocols can be implemented using the\ncurrent standard low-cost RFID infrastructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2012 15:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

Both forward security and backward security are required\nto maintain the privacy of a tag i.e., exposure of a tag's secret key should\nnot reveal the past or future secret keys of the tag. We envisage the need for\na formal model for backward security for RFID protocol designs in shared key\nsettings, since the RFID tags are too resource-constrained to support public\nkey settings. However, there has not been much research on backward security\nfor shared key environment since Serge Vaudenay in his Asiacrypt 2007 paper\nshowed that perfect backward security is impossible to achieve without public\nkey settings. We propose a Key-Insulated Mutual Authentication Protocol for\nshared key environment, KIMAP, which minimizes the damage caused by secret key\nexposure using insulated keys. Even if a tag's secret key is exposed during an\nauthentication session, forward security and `restricted' backward security of\nthe tag are preserved under our assumptions. The notion of `restricted'\nbackward security is that the adversary misses the protocol transcripts which\nare needed to update the compromised secret key. Although our definition does\nnot capture perfect backward security, it is still suitable for effective\nimplementation as the tags are highly mobile in practice. We also provide a\nformal security model of KIMAP. Our scheme is more efficient than previous\nproposals from the viewpoint of computational requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Sep 2012 15:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}
