While infrared observations reveal the evolutionary status of the\ndisk, optical spectroscopy is fundamental to acquire information on the\nproperties of the central star and on the accretion characteristics. 2MASS\narchive data and the Spitzer c2d survey of the Chamaeleon II dark cloud have\nprovided disk properties of a large number of young stars. We complement these\ndata with spectroscopy with the aim of providing physical stellar parameters\nand accretion properties. We use FLAMES/UVES+GIRAFFE observations of 40 members\nof Cha II to measure radial velocities through cross-correlation technique, Li\nabundances by means of curves of growth, and for a suitable star elemental\nabundances of Fe, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, and Ni using the code MOOG. From the\nequivalent widths of the Halpha, Hbeta, and the HeI-5876, 6678, 7065 Angstrom\nemission lines, we estimate the mass accretion rates, dMacc/dt, for all the\nobjects. We derive a radial velocity distribution for the Cha II stars\n(<Vrad>=11.4+-2.0 km/s). We find dMacc/dt prop. to Mstar^1.3 and to Age^(-0.82)\nin the 0.1-1.0 Msun mass regime, and a mean dMacc/dt for Cha II of ~7*10^(-10)\nMsun/yr. We also establish a relationship between the HeI-7065 Angstrom line\nemission and the accretion luminosity. The radial velocity distributions of\nstars and gas in Cha II are consistent. The spread in dMacc/dt at a given\nstellar mass is about one order of magnitude and can not be ascribed entirely\nto short timescale variability. Analyzing the relation between dMacc/dt and the\ncolors in Spitzer and 2MASS bands, we find indications that the inner disk\nchanges from optically thick to optically thin at dMacc/dt~10^(-10) Msun/yr.\nFinally, the disk fraction is consistent with the age of Cha II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 16:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We formulate the\nrecommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal\nprobability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be\npredicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is\ncomputationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the\nBP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each\nactive user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As\nopposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving\nthe recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the\nrecommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the\nrecommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a\ntraining period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),\nwe verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of\nthe users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to\nthe state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)\nand Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision\naccuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a\nnew promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability\nwhile providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 16:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

This paper explores this\ndissonance with particular focus on how gravity couples to matter from the\nperspective of the Cartan-geometric formulation of gravity. There the\ngravitational field is represented by a pair of variables: 1) a `contact\nvector' $V^A$ which is geometrically visualized as the contact point between\nthe spacetime manifold and a model spacetime being `rolled' on top of it, and\n2) a gauge connection $A_{\\mu}^{\\ph\\mu AB}$, taken to be valued in the Lie\nalgebra of SO(2,3) or SO(1,4), which mathematically determines how much the\nmodel spacetime is rotated when rolled. By insisting on two principles, the\n{\\em gauge principle} and {\\em polynomial simplicity}, we show how one can\nreformulate the standard matter field actions in a way that is harmonious with\nCartan's geometric construction. This yields a formulation of all matter fields\nin terms of first order partial differential equations. We show in detail how\nthe standard second order formulation can be recovered. Furthermore, the\nenergy-momentum and spin-density three-forms are naturally combined into a\nsingle object here denoted the spin-energy-momentum three-form. Finally, we\nhighlight a peculiarity in the mathematical structure of our first-order\nformulation of Yang-Mills fields. This suggests a way to unify a U(1) gauge\nfield with gravity into a SO(1,5)-valued gauge field using a natural\ngeneralization of Cartan geometry in which the larger symmetry group is\nspontaneously broken down to $SO(1,3)\\times U(1)$. The coupling of this unified\ntheory to matter fields and possible extensions to non-Abelian gauge fields are\nleft as open questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 18:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 06:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The secure d.o.f.\nof the canonical Gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is zero. It has been\nknown that a strictly positive secure d.o.f. can be obtained in the Gaussian\nwiretap channel by using a helper which sends structured cooperative signals.\nWe show that the exact secure d.o.f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with a\nhelper is 1/2. Our achievable scheme is based on real interference alignment\nand cooperative jamming, which renders the message signal and the cooperative\njamming signal separable at the legitimate receiver, but aligns them perfectly\nat the eavesdropper preventing any reliable decoding of the message signal. Our\nconverse is based on two key lemmas. The first lemma quantifies the secrecy\npenalty by showing that the net effect of an eavesdropper on the system is that\nit eliminates one of the independent channel inputs. The second lemma\nquantifies the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between the\ncooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate. We extend this\nresult to the case of M helpers, and show that the exact secure d.o.f. in this\ncase is M/(M+1).

In this paper, we propose to use a database of images, rather than\ncoordinates, and frame the problem as transfer learning: learning a\ndiscriminant model on a reference task to apply it to a different but related\nnew task. To facilitate statistical analysis of small cohorts, we use a sparse\ndiscriminant model that selects predictive voxels on the reference task and\nthus provides a principled procedure to define ROIs. The benefits of our\napproach are twofold. First it uses the reference database for prediction, i.e.\nto provide potential biomarkers in a clinical setting. Second it increases\nstatistical power on the new task. We demonstrate on a set of 18 pairs of\nfunctional MRI experimental conditions that our approach gives good prediction.\nIn addition, on a specific transfer situation involving different scanners at\ndifferent locations, we show that voxel selection based on transfer learning\nleads to higher detection power on small cohorts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 19:38:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 14:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-01"}

One of these is the Roche density, which is that required\nfor a strengthless satellite to resist tidal disruption by its primary. Another\nis the Toomre density, which is that required for de-stabilizing self-gravity\nto defeat the stabilizing influences of pressure and rotation. We show that for\nsublayers containing aerodynamically well-coupled dust, the Toomre density\nexceeds the Roche density by many (up to about 4) orders of magnitude.

Sound-crossing times for thin layers are easily shorter than\nfree-fall times, and the effective sound speed in dust-gas suspensions\ndecreases only weakly with the dust-to-gas ratio (as the inverse square root).\nOur findings assume that particles are small enough that their stopping times\nin gas are shorter than all other timescales.

We present a model for the synthesis of the XRB\nthat uses as input a library of AGN X-ray spectra generated by the Monte Carlo\nsimulations described by Brightman & Nandra. This is essential to account for\nthe Compton scattering of X-ray photons in a dense medium and the impact of\nthat process on the spectra of obscured AGN. We identify a small number of\ninput parameters to the XRB synthesis code which encapsulate the minimum level\nof uncertainty in reconstructing the XRB spectrum. These are the power-law\nindex and high energy cutoff of the intrinsic X-ray spectra of AGN, the level\nof the reflection component in AGN spectra and the fraction of CT AGN in the\nUniverse. We then map the volume of the space allowed to these parameters by\ncurrent observations of the XRB spectrum in the range 3-100 keV. One of the\nleast constrained parameters is the fraction of CT AGN. Statistically\nacceptable fits to the XRB spectrum at the 68% confidence level can be obtained\nfor CT fractions in the range 5-50%. This is because of degeneracies among\ninput parameters to the XRB synthesis code and uncertainties in the modeling of\nAGN spectra (e.g. reflection). The most promising route for constraining the\nfraction of CT AGN in the Universe is via the direct detection of those sources\nin high energy (>10keV) surveys. It is shown that the observed fraction of CT\nsources identified in the SWIFT/BAT survey, limits the intrinsic fraction of CT\nAGN, at least at low redshift, to 10-20% (68% confidence level). We also make\npredictions on the number density of CT sources that current and future X-ray\nmissions are expected to discover.

X-ray observations with\nSwift/XRT, Chandra, and XMM-Newton to ~19 d reveal a single power law decline.\nThe optical afterglow is faint, and comparison to the X-ray flux indicates that\nGRB 120804A is \"dark\", with a rest-frame extinction of A_V~2.5 mag (at z~1.3).\nThe intrinsic neutral hydrogen column density inferred from the X-ray spectrum,\nN_H~2x10^22 cm^-2, is commensurate with the large extinction. The host galaxy\nexhibits red optical/near-IR colors. Equally important, JVLA observations at\n0.9-11 d reveal a constant 5.8 GHz flux density and an optically-thin spectrum,\nunprecedented for GRB afterglows, but suggestive instead of emission from the\nhost galaxy.

In this AMR system there are four basic units. They are reading\nunit, communication unit, data receiving and processing unit and billing\nsystem. For reading unit we identified the disk rotation of the energy meter\nand stored the data in microcontroller. So it is not required to change the\ncurrent analog energy meter. An external module will be added with the current\nenergy meter. In the communication unit Wimax transceiver was used for wireless\ncommunication between meter end and the server end because of its wide coverage\narea. In the data receiving and processing unit meter reading will be collected\nfrom the transceiver which is controlled by another microcontroller. There will\nbe a computer application that will take the data from the microcontroller.\nThis will also help to avoid any tampering or break down of energy meter.

Much of this soft hot gas is likely to be from\nlocal active star-forming regions; however, besides the nuclear region, the\nmorphology of hot gas does not strongly correlate with sites of active star\nformation. The central ~650 pc radius starburst zone exhibits much higher\nsurface brightness diffuse emission than the surrounding regions and a harder\nspectral component in addition to its soft component.

Moreover these variabilities, also\nknown as inter-subject or inter-session variabilities, require lengthy\ncalibration sessions before the BCI system can be used. Furthermore, the\ncalibration session has to be repeated for each subject independently and\nbefore use of the BCI due to the inter-session variability. In this study, we\npresent an algorithm in order to minimize the above-mentioned variabilities and\nto overcome the time-consuming and usually error-prone calibration time. Our\nalgorithm is based on linear programming support-vector machines and their\nextensions to a multiple kernel learning framework. We tackle the inter-subject\nor -session variability in the feature spaces of the classifiers. This is done\nby incorporating each subject- or session-specific feature spaces into much\nricher feature spaces with a set of optimal decision boundaries. Each decision\nboundary represents the subject- or a session specific spatio-temporal\nvariabilities of neural signals.

Here, we present a scalable qubit design and device architecture\nbased on the spin states of single holes confined in a quantum dot molecule.\nThe quantum dot molecule qubit enables a new strategy for optical coherent\ncontrol with dramatically enhanced wavelength tunability. The use of hole spins\nallows the suppression of decoherence via hyperfine interactions and enables\ncoherent spin rotations using Raman transitions mediated by a hole-spin-mixed\noptically excited state. Because the spin mixing is present only in the\noptically excited state, dephasing and decoherence are strongly suppressed in\nthe ground states that define the qubits and nondestructive readout is\npossible.

So defecting agents face a social pressure, which decreases if\nfree-riding becomes widespread. In this model, diversity among agents naturally\nappears because of the different sensitivity towards the social norm. We study\nthe evolution of cooperation as a response to the social norm (i) for the\nreplicator dynamics, and (ii) for the logit dynamics by means of numerical\nsimulations.

However, in real\nstructures, there is an additional potential barrier caused by a oxide layer at\ninterface. For typical values of thickness and height of a barrier its tunnel\ntransparency for light holes can be higher by three order of magnitude than\nthat for heavy holes. Due to such separative role of insulator layer one can\nexpect that the current is manly a contribution of light holes. To clear up\nthis problem the investigation of transport in a magnetic field is used as a\nkey experiment in this work. The pronounced magnetic field effect for heavy\nholes in investigated Pb-p-HgCdTe Schottky barriers is expected only at\nextremely strong magnetic fields B>10 T within the framework of both diode and\ndiffusion mechanism of transport. At the same time experimentally more than\ntwofold decrease in saturation current is observed even at B=0.5 T at any\norientation of magnetic field. The studies performed for HgCdTe with different\nKane's gap and at different temperatures show that the magnitude of magnetic\nfield effect is uniquely determined by the ratio of light hole cyclotron energy\nto a thermal energy. However the magnitude of effect exceeds considerably the\nprediction of the simple theory and the experimental magnetic field\ndependencies of a saturation current do not follow the simple exponential\nfalling predicted for thermionic current. The reason of this discrepancy\nremains a mystery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 08:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In terms of efficiency and\naccuracy, the exponential Rosenbrock--Euler time integrator has advantages over\nstandard time-dicretization schemes, which suffer from time-step restrictions\nor excessive numerical diffusion when advection processes are dominating.

Our method improves by an order of\nmagnitude the known processing time of each element in the stream, which is\nextremely crucial for data stream applications. For example, for a sample of\nsize $O(\\epsilon^{-2} \\log{(1/\\delta)})$ in Non-strict streams, our solution\nrequires $O((\\log\\log(1/\\epsilon))^2 + (\\log\\log(1/\\delta)) ^ 2)$ operations\nper stream element, whereas the best previous solution requires\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2} \\log^2(1/\\delta))$ evaluations of a fully independent hash\nfunction per element.

Such systems have distinctive\ncharacteristics in comparison with ordinary chemical systems: i) the numbers of\nmolecules involved are small, ii) there are typically only a couple of genes in\na cell with a finite regulation time scale. Due to the fluctuations caused by\nthese features, the system behavior can be quite different from the one\nobtained by rate equations, because the rate equations ignore molecular\nfluctuations and thus are exact only in the infinite molecular number limit.\nThe molecular fluctuations on a free-running circadian system have been studied\nby Gonze et al.

They consider, however, only the first effect, assuming that the gene\nprocess is fast enough for the second effect to be ignored, but this has not\nbeen examined systematically yet. In this work, we study fluctuation effects\ndue to the finite gene regulation time by introducing a new scale parameter\n$\\tau$, which we take as the unbinding time of a nuclear protein from the gene.\nWe focus on the case where the fluctuations due to small molecular numbers can\nbe ignored.

We also demonstrate that the distribution width for the oscillation\nperiod and the amplitude scales with $\\sqrt\\tau$, and the correlation time of\nthe oscillation scales with $1/\\tau$ in the small $\\tau$ regime.

The proposed method does not rely on the detailed\nknowledge of the three-dimensional field configuration but is general enough to\nemploy only a magnetic connectivity matrix on the lower boundary. The\ncalculation yields a minimum free magnetic energy and a relative magnetic\nhelicity consistent with this free magnetic energy. The method is directly\napplicable to photospheric or chromospheric vector magnetograms of solar active\nregions. Upon validation, it basically reproduces magnetic energies and\nhelicities obtained by well-known, but computationally more intensive and\nnon-unique, methods relying on the extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic\nfield vector. We apply the method to three active regions, calculating the\nphotospheric connectivity matrices by means of simulated annealing, rather than\na model-dependent nonlinear force-free extrapolation. For two of these regions\nwe correct for the inherent linear force-free overestimation in free energy and\nrelative helicity that is larger for larger, more eruptive, active regions. In\nthe third studied region, our calculation can lead to a physical interpretation\nof observed eruptive manifestations. We conclude that the proposed method,\nincluding the proposed inference of the magnetic connectivity matrix, is\npractical enough to contribute to a physical interpretation of the dynamical\nevolution of solar active regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 13:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The\ntrigger and timing system of the Double Chooz experiment was designed according\nto this goal. The Double Chooz trigger system is driven by the basic idea of\ntriggering on multiple thresholds according to the total visible energy and\nadditionally triggering on the number of active photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in\nthe detector. To do so, the trigger system continuously monitors the analogue\nsignals from all PMTs in the detector. The amplitudes of these PMT-signals are\nsummed for groups of certain PMTs (group signals) and for all PMTs (sum\nsignal), respectively. The group signals are discriminated by two thresholds\nfor each input channel and four thresholds for the sum signal. The resulting\nsignals are processed by the trigger logic unit which is implemented in a FPGA.\nIn addition to the proper trigger, the trigger system provides a common clock\nsignal for all subsequent data acquisition systems to guarantee a synchronous\nreadout of the Double Chooz detectors. The present design of the system\nprovides a high flexibility for the applied logic and settings, making it\nuseful for experiments other than Double Chooz. The Double Chooz trigger and\ntiming system was installed and commissioned in 2011. This article describes\nthe hardware of the trigger and timing system. Furthermore the setup,\nimplemented trigger logic and performance of the trigger and timing system for\nthe Double Chooz experiment is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 13:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 11:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Specifying the data in a unified fashion is necessary\nfor any system that intends to integrate with state, federal, and international\nlaw enforcement agencies. However, the contents, format, and structure of the\ndata is highly inconsistent across jurisdictions, and each datum requires\ndifferent ways of being printed, transmitted, and displayed. The goal was to\ndesign a system that is unified in its approach to specify data, and is\namenable to future \"unknown unknowns\". We have developed a domain-specific\nlanguage in Common Lisp which allows the specification of complex data with\nevolving formats and structure, and is inter-operable with the Common Lisp\nlanguage. The resultant system has enabled the easy handling of complex\nevolving information in the general criminal data environment and has made it\npossible to manage and extend the system in a high-paced market. The language\nhas allowed the principal product of Secure Outcomes Inc. to enjoy success with\nover 50 users throughout the United States.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 14:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

It was found that the most significant links\nassociated with epilepsy are those bilateral links with regions mainly\nbelonging to the default mode network and subcortex, such as amygdala, fusiform\ngyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, temporal pole, parahippocampal\ngyrus, insula, middle occipital gyrus, cuneus. These links were found to have\nmuch higher odd ratios than other links, and all of them showed reduced\nfunctional couplings in patients compared with controls. Interestingly, with\nthe increasing of the seizure onset frequency or duration of illness, the\nfunctional connection between these bilateral regions became further reduced.\nOn the other hand, as a functional compensation and brain plasticity,\nconnections of these bilateral regions to other brain regions were abnormally\nenhanced and became even much stronger with the increase of the seizure onset\nfrequency. Furthermore, patients had higher network efficiencies than healthy\ncontrols, and the seizure onset frequency was found to be positively correlated\nwith the network efficiency. A negative correlation between the bilateral\nconnection and the network efficiency was also observed. To further validate\nour findings, we then employed our BWAS results in discriminating patients from\nhealthy controls and the leave-one-out accuracy was around 78%. Given the fact\nthat a genome-wide association study with a large cohort has failed to identify\nany significant association between genes and epilepsy, our study could provide\nus with a set of endophenotypes for further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 14:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-26"}

Using Summability\nCalculus, any given finite sum of the form $f(n) = \\sum_{k=a}^n s_k\\, g(k,n)$,\nwhere $s_k$ is an arbitrary periodic sequence, becomes immediately \\emph{in\nanalytic form}. Not only can we differentiate and integrate with respect to the\nbound $n$ without having to rely on an explicit analytic formula for the finite\nsum, but we can also deduce asymptotic expansions, accelerate convergence,\nassign natural values to divergent sums, and evaluate the finite sum for any\n$n\\in\\mathbb{C}$. This follows because the discrete definition of the simple\nfinite sum $f(n) = \\sum_{k=a}^n s_k\\, g(k,n)$ embodies a \\emph{unique natural}\ndefinition for all $n\\in\\mathbb{C}$. Throughout the paper, many established\nresults are strengthened such as the Bohr-Mollerup theorem, Stirling's\napproximation, Glaisher's approximation, and the Shannon-Nyquist sampling\ntheorem. In addition, many celebrated theorems are extended and generalized\nsuch as the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula and Boole's summation formula.\nFinally, we show that countless identities that have been proved throughout the\npast 300 years by different mathematicians using different approaches can\nactually be derived in an elementary straightforward manner using the rules of\nSummability Calculus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 10:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}

We developed a prototype of a smart laptop charger that\ncontrols the charging process depending on the locally measured frequency of\nthe electricity grid. If this technique is incorporated into millions of\ndevices in UK households, this will contribute significantly to the stability\nof the electricity grid, help to mitigate the power production fluctuations\nfrom renewable energy sources and avoid the high cost of building and\nmaintaining conventional power plants as standby reserve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 13:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2013 15:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-26"}

This error can be corrected by\nperiodically updating the system with a Metropolis criteria, where the\nintegration step is treated as a selection probability for candidate state\ngeneration. Such a method, closely related to generalized hybrid Monte Carlo\n(GHMC), satisfies the balance condition by imposing a reversal of momenta upon\ncandidate rejection. In the present study, we demonstrate that such momentum\nreversals can have a significant impact on molecular kinetics and extend the\ntime required for system decorrelation, resulting in an order of magnitude\nincrease in the integrated autocorrelation times of molecular variables for the\nworst cases. We present a simple method, referred to as reduced-flipping GHMC,\nthat uses the information of the previous, current, and candidate states to\nreduce the probability of momentum flipping following candidate rejection while\nrigorously satisfying the balance condition. This method is a simple\nmodification to traditional, automatic-flipping, GHMC methods and significantly\nmitigates the impact of such algorithms on molecular kinetics and simulation\nmixing times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 01:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Coarse-grained mesoscopic\nand macroscopic analogs are derived leading to the coupled system of PDEs for\nthe density of the pedestrian traffic. The obtained PDE system is of a mixed\nhyperbolic-elliptic type and therefore, we rigorously derive higher-order\nnonlinear diffusive corrections for the macroscopic PDE model. We perform\nnumerical experiments, which compare and contrast the behavior of the\nmicroscopic stochastic model and the resulting coarse-grained PDEs for various\nparameter settings and initial conditions. We also demonstrate that the\nnonlinear diffusion is essential for reproducing the behavior of the stochastic\nsystem in the nonhyperbolic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 02:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}
