Electronic localization is captured\nby employing hybrid functionals within time-dependent density-functional theory\n(TDDFT) and with Hubbard-model corrections within the delta-SCF approach. The\nperformance of both methods are studied comparatively and shown to be in good\nagreement with experiment. The Hubbard-corrected functionals provide further\ninsight into the localization of electrons and on the charge-transfer character\nof excited-states. The gained insight allows us to comment on envisioned\nfunctionalization strategies to improve the performance of these systems.\nComplementary discussions on the delta-SCF method are also presented in order\nto fill some of the gaps in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 16:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In this\npaper we describe a previously-unknown \"precession\" of the peak emission\ndirection with time, both before and after the merger, about the total angular\nmomentum direction. We demonstrate the gravitational wave polarization encodes\nthe orientation of this direction to the line of sight. We argue the effects of\npolarization can be estimated nonparametrically, directly from the\ngravitational wave signal as seen along one line of sight, as a slowly-varying\nfeature on top of a rapidly-varying carrier. After merger, our results can be\ninterpreted as a coherent excitation of quasinormal modes of different angular\norders, a superposition which naturally \"precesses\" and modulates the\nline-of-sight amplitude. Recent analytic calculations have arrived at a similar\ngeometric interpretation. We suspect the line-of-sight polarization content\nwill be a convenient observable with which to define new high-precision tests\nof general relativity using gravitational waves. Additionally, as the nonlinear\nmerger process seeds the initial coherent perturbation, we speculate the\namplitude of this effect provides a new probe of the strong-field dynamics\nduring merger. To demonstrate the ubiquity of the effects we describe, we\nsummarize the post-merger evolution of 104 generic precessing binary mergers.\nFinally, we provide estimates for the detectable impacts of precession on the\nwaveforms from high-mass sources. These expressions may identify new precessing\nbinary parameters whose waveforms are dissimilar from the existing sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 16:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 20:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-14"}

This paper aims to\nstudy linear precoding designs for a cellular MU-TWRS where a multi-antenna\nbase station (BS) conducts bi-directional communications with multiple mobile\nstations (MSs) via a multi-antenna relay station (RS) with amplify-and-forward\nrelay strategy.

The RS precoding design with the BS precoder\nfixed, on the other hand, is non-convex and we present an iterative algorithm\nto find a local optimal solution. Then, the joint BS-RS precoding is obtained\nby solving the BS precoding and the RS precoding alternately.

The method\naccommodates arbitrary temporal sampling, and takes into account measurement\nuncertainties for arbitrary error models (not just Gaussian) on both the time\nand signal variables. Any model for the deterministic component of the\nvariation of the signal with time is supported, as is any model of the\nstochastic component on the signal and time variables. Models illustrated here\nare constant and sinusoidal models for the signal mean combined with a Gaussian\nstochastic component, as well as a purely stochastic model, the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process. The posterior probability distribution over model\nparameters is determined via Monte Carlo sampling. Models are compared using\nthe \"cross-validation likelihood\", in which the posterior-averaged likelihood\nfor different partitions of the data are combined. In principle this is more\nrobust to changes in the prior than is the evidence (the prior-averaged\nlikelihood). The method is demonstrated by applying it to the light curves of\n11 ultra cool dwarf stars, claimed by a previous study to show statistically\nsignificant variability. This is reassessed here by calculating the\ncross-validation likelihood for various time series models, including a null\nhypothesis of no variability beyond the error bars. 10 of 11 light curves are\nconfirmed as being significantly variable, and one of these seems to be\nperiodic, with two plausible periods identified.

The best currently known\ninteractive debugging systems rely upon some meta information in terms of fault\nprobabilities, which can speed up the debugging procedure in the good case, but\ncan also have negative impact on the performance in the bad case. The problem\nis that assessment of the meta information is only possible a-posteriori.\nConsequently, as long as the actual fault is unknown, there is always some risk\nof suboptimal interactive diagnoses discrimination.

By employing this mechanism we prove two conjectures\nregarding the total number of peaks, as well as a decomposition rule in the\ncircular pattern of an order $n$ HRW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 13:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 09:26:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 14:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 15:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Using data from the\noptical LINEAR asteroid survey, we characterize the optical variability of\nblazars by fitting a damped random walk model to individual light curves with\ntwo main model parameters, the characteristic timescales of variability (tau),\nand driving amplitudes on short timescales (sigma). Imposing cuts on minimum\ntau and sigma allows for blazar selection with high efficiency E and\ncompleteness C. To test the efficacy of this approach, we apply this method to\noptically variable LINEAR objects that fall within the several-arcminute error\nellipses of gamma-ray sources in the Fermi 2FGL catalog.

The existence of universality classes and the relevance of\nanomalous dimensions are reproduced by the hadronization models in Pythia 8 and\nHerwig++, though the two programs differ in the values of their low-energy\nmatrix elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 20:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 19:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Two signals\nwere detected in most phases, corresponding to probe atoms on cubic R- and\nnon-cubic Pd-sublattices.

While there are empirical\nsuggestions of particular increasing length scales that accompany such\ntransitions, this identification is not universal. To better understand such\nbehavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in\nstochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature\nclassical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature\nto include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or\nstochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical\nsystems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of\nspace-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation\nrelates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative\nsystems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body\nquantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the\nabsence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible\nlattice counterparts) may exhibit a zero-point \"quantum dynamical\nheterogeneity\" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially\nnon-uniform. While the static length scales accompanying this phenomenon do not\nexhibit a clear divergence in standard correlation functions, the length scale\nof the dynamical heterogeneities can increase dramatically. We study \"quantum\njamming\" and illustrate how a hard core bosonic system may undergo a zero\ntemperature quantum critical metal-to-insulator-type transition with an\nextremely large effective dynamical exponent z>4 consistent with length scales\nthat increase far more slowly than the relaxation time as a putative critical\ntransition is approached.

The reduced size of each cell\nforces to install many cells, and consequently causes to increase inter-cell\ninterference at many cell edge areas. This paper considers a practical way of\nmitigating interference at the receiver equipped with multiple antennas in\ninterference channels. Recently, it is shown that the capacity region of\ninterference channels over point-to-point codes could be established with a\ncombination of two schemes: treating interference as noise and jointly decoding\nboth desired and interference signals. In practice, the first scheme is\nstraightforwardly implementable, but the second scheme needs impractically huge\ncomputational burden at the receiver. Within a practical range of complexity,\nthis paper proposes the interference-aware successive decoding (IASD) algorithm\nwhich successively decodes desired and interference signals while updating a\npriori information of both signals. When multiple decoders are allowed to be\nused, the proposed IASD can be extended to interference-aware parallel decoding\n(IAPD). The proposed algorithm is analyzed with extrinsic information transfer\n(EXIT) chart so as to show that the interference decoding is advantageous to\nimprove the performance.

By incorporating with the\nrandom linear network coding technique, the existing schemes can reduce the\nretransmission overhead significantly. However, the receivers may incur large\ndecoding delay and complexity due to the batch decoding scheme. In addition,\nthe dependency on the explicit feedback leads to scalability problem in larger\nnetworks. In this paper, a cooperative multicast protocol named MWNCast is\nproposed based on a novel moving window network coding technique. We prove\nthree properties of the proposed scheme. Firstly, without explicit feedback,\nMWNCast can approach the cooperative capacity with the packet loss probability\ndropping almost exponentially with the increase of window size. Secondly, the\naverage decoding delay of a receiver is on the order of\n$O(\\frac{1}{(1-\\rho)^2})$ with respect to its traffic intensity $\\rho$.\nThirdly, MWNCast can achieve the linear decoding complexity of $O(W)$ with\nrespect to the window size $W$.

Their\nmain aim was to describe the statistics of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence\nin spectral space, using a simple set of ordinary differential equations. In\nthe eighties, shell models of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence emerged\nbased on the same principles as their hydrodynamic counter-part but also\nincorporating interactions between magnetic and velocity fields. In recent\nyears, significant improvements have been made such as the inclusion of\nnon-local interactions and appropriate definitions for helicities. Though shell\nmodels cannot account for the spatial complexity of MHD turbulence, their\ndynamics are not over simplified and do reflect those of real MHD turbulence\nincluding intermittency or chaotic reversals of large-scale modes. Furthermore,\nthese models use realistic values for dimensionless parameters (high kinetic\nand magnetic Reynolds numbers, low or high magnetic Prandtl number) allowing\nextended inertial range and accurate dissipation rate. Using modern computers\nit is difficult to attain an inertial range of three decades with direct\nnumerical simulations, whereas eight are possible using shell models. In this\nreview we set up a general mathematical framework allowing the description of\nany MHD shell model. The variety of the latter, with their advantages and\nweaknesses, is introduced.

The CKF solution is a successful solution, but it contains a poloidal\ncurrent sheet that flows along the last open field line. This current sheet is\nartificially added to make the current system closed. In this paper, we suggest\nan alternative method to solve the pulsar equation and construct pulsar\nmagnetosphere models without a current sheet. In our method, the pulsar\nequation is decomposed into Ampere's law and the force-free condition. We\nnumerically solve these equations simultaneously with a fixed poloidal current.\nAs a result, we obtain a pulsar magnetosphere model without a current sheet,\nwhich is similar to the CKF solution near the neutron star and has a jet-like\nstructure at a distance along the pole.

The properties of such clumpy dusty tori can be inferred by\nanalyzing spectral energy distributions (SEDs), sometimes with scarce sampling\ngiven that large aperture telescopes and long integration times are needed to\nget good spatial resolution and signal. We aim at using the information already\npresent in the data and the assumption of clumpy dusty torus, in particular,\nthe CLUMPY models of Nenkova et al., to evaluate the optimum next observation\nsuch that we maximize the constraining power of the new observed photometric\npoint. To this end, we use the existing and barely applied idea of Bayesian\nadaptive exploration, a mixture of Bayesian inference, prediction and decision\ntheories. The result is that the new photometric filter to use is the one that\nmaximizes the expected utility, which we approximate with the entropy of the\npredictive distribution. In other words, we have to sample where there is\nlarger variability in the SEDs compatible with the data with what we know of\nthe model parameters. We show that Bayesian adaptive exploration can be used to\nsuggest new observations, and ultimately optimal filter sets, to better\nconstrain the parameters of the clumpy dusty torus models. In general, we find\nthat the region between 10 and 200 um produces the largest increase in the\nexpected utility, although sub-mm data from ALMA also prove to be useful. It is\nimportant to note that here we are not considering the angular resolution of\nthe data, which is key when constraining torus parameters. Therefore, the\nexpected utilities derived from this methodology must be weighted with the\nspatial resolution of the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 08:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Such winds are\nmagneto-centrifugal winds launched from a thin annulus in the disc, along open\nmagnetic field lines that fan out above the disc. In principle, such winds\ncould be found in two situations: (1) at the interface between an inner Jet\nEmitting Disc, which is itself powering magneto-centrifugally driven winds, and\nan outer standard accretion disc; (2) at the interface between an inner closed\nstellar magnetosphere and the outer standard accretion disc. We refer to\nTerminal or T-winds to the former kind and to Magnetospheric or M-winds to the\nlatter.\n  The full set of resistive and viscous steady state MHD equations are analyzed\nfor the disc (the annulus), which allow us to derive general expressions valid\nfor both configurations. We find that, under the framework of our analysis, the\nonly source of energy able to power any kind of fan-shaped winds is the viscous\ntransport of rotational energy coming below the inner radii. Using standard\nlocal $\\alpha$ prescriptions for the anomalous (turbulent) transport of angular\nmomentum and magnetic fields in the disc, we derive the strength of the\ntransport coefficients that are needed to steadily sustain the global\nconfiguration. It turns out that, in order for these winds to be dynamically\nrelevant and explain observed jets, the disc coefficients must be far much\nlarger than values expected from current knowledge of turbulence occurring\ninside proto-stellar discs.\n  Either the current view on MHD turbulence must be deeply reconsidered or\nsteady-state fan-shaped winds are never realized in Nature.

The model of SF galaxies reproduces the\nconstraints obtained by Spitzer, Herschel, and ground-based submm/mm\nexperiments: number counts, redshift distribution of galaxies, cosmic\nbackground intensity and anisotropies. The template SEDs of this model are\nextrapolated to the radio adding synchrotron, free-free, and spinning dust\nemissions. To fix the synchrotron intensity, we use the IR/radio flux ratio,\nq70, and a spectral index beta=-3. For a constant q70, our model added to the\nAGN contribution provides a good fit to the number counts from 12THz to 408MHz\nand to the CIB. Spinning dust accounts for up to 20% of the cosmic microwave\nbackground produced by SF galaxies, but for less than 10% of the total\nbackground when AGN are included.

Considering the case when\nq70 decreases strongly with redshift, this still does not explain the ARCADE2\nresults. It also yields to an overestimate of the low-flux number counts in the\nradio. Thus, we rule out a steep variation of q70 with redshift at least for\nz<3.5. Adding a population of faint SF galaxies at high redshift (Lir<1e11Lsun\nand 4<z<6), which would reproduce the ARCADE2 results, leads to predictions of\nthe CIB much higher than what is observed, ruling out this as the explanation\nfor the ARCADE2 results.

So far this issue has\nbeen mostly investigated with collisionless N-body numerical models. We\nnumerically investigate how the coupled effect of collisions and radiation\npressure can affect the formation and survival of radial and azimutal\nstructures in a disc perturbed by a planet. We consider two set-ups: a planet\nembedded within an extended disc and a planet exterior to an inner debris ring.\nWe use the DyCoSS code of Thebault(2012) and derive synthetic images of the\nsystem in scattered light. The planet's mass and orbit, as well as the disc's\ncollisional activity are explored as free parameters.\n  We find that collisions always significantly damp planet-induced structures.\nFor the case of an embedded planet, the planet's signature, mostly a density\ngap around its radial position, should remain detectable in head-on images if\nM_planet > M_Saturn. If the system is seen edge-on, however, inferring the\npresence of the planet is much more difficult, although some planet-induced\nsignatures might be observable under favourable conditions.\n  For the inner-ring/external-planet case, planetary perturbations cannot\nprevent collision-produced small fragments from populating the regions beyond\nthe ring: The radial luminosity profile exterior to the ring is close to the\none it should have in the absence of the planet. However, a Jovian planet on a\ncircular orbit leaves precessing azimutal structures that can be used to\nindirectly infer its presence. For a planet on an eccentric orbit, the ring is\nelliptic and the pericentre glow effect is visible despite of collisions and\nradiation pressure, but detecting such features in real discs is not an\nunambiguous indicator of the presence of an outer planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 14:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Scaling the\ngoverning equations reveals the dimensionless groups that identify topological\nregimes of droplet behavior which provides a novel perspective from which to\nfurther investigate jets, droplets, and other capillary phenomena over large\nlength scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 15:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-19"}

Most MSP gamma-ray light curves display\nsharp peaks indicative of thin accelerating gaps, suggesting copious\npair-creation in the open volume. MSP gamma-ray and radio light curves have\nbeen simulated using geometric outer-gap (OG), slot-gap/two-pole caustic (TPC),\nand pair-starved polar cap gamma-ray models and either a hollow-cone beam or\naltitude-limited, outer-magnetospheric gap radio model, all assuming a vacuum\nretarded dipolar magnetic field geometry. A Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum\nlikelihood technique has been developed to find the best-fit model parameters\nfor nineteen MSPs using data from the LAT and various radio observatories. The\nbest-fit viewing angles follow a uniform, angular distribution. The\ndistribution of magnetic inclination angles favors all angles equally, contrary\nto analyses of non-recycled pulsars, which supports the theory that MSPs have\nbeen spun-up via accretion. There are suggestions that the radio emission\nshould occur nearer the light cylinder. These results have implications for MSP\npopulation simulations and for addressing MSP contributions to diffuse\nbackgrounds. An implied transition in the gamma-ray luminosity versus spin-down\npower trend is observed but more statistics are necessary to describe it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2012 15:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-19"}

The third is to explore many-body physics\ninaccessible to existing theoretical techniques.
