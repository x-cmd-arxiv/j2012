Such a stochastic\ndifferential equation constitutes the basis for the calculation of the\n(nucleation) induction time under Kramers' theory of thermally activated escape\nprocesses. Considering the nucleation stage as a Poisson rare-event, analytical\nexpressions for the induction time statistics are deduced for both steady and\nunsteady conditions, the latter assuming the semiadiabatic limit. These\nexpressions can be used to identify the underlying mechanism of molecular\ncluster formation (distinguishing between homogeneous or heterogeneous\nnucleation from the nucleation statistics is possible) as well as to predict\ninduction times and induction time distributions. The predictions of this model\nare in good agreement with experimentally measured induction times at constant\ntemperature, unlike the values obtained from the classical equation, but\nagreement is not so good for induction time statistics. Stochastic simulations\ntruncated to the maximum waiting time of the experiments confirm that this fact\nis due to the time constraints imposed by experiments. Correcting for this\neffect, the experimental and predicted curves fit remarkably well. Thus, the\nproposed model seems to be a versatile tool to predict cluster size\ndistributions, nucleation rates, (nucleation) induction time and induction time\nstatistics for a wide range of conditions (e.g. time-dependent temperature,\nsupersaturation, pH, etc.) where classical nucleation theory is of limited\napplicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 16:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2013 14:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-25"}

In the globalized world the importance of Information Systems (IS)\nand Information Technology (IT) become increasingly relevant regarding the\nrequirements imposed by competition. Both the knowledge of the business as the\nrapid flow of information are fundamental for a enterprise decision making.\nWhereas the basic definition of IT = hardware + software, i.e., tools that has\nbeen used to create, store and disseminate data and information in the creation\nof knowledge, and IS = IT + People + procedures that collect, process and\ndisseminate the information to support decision making, coordination, control,\nanalysis and visualization in the organization [01], it makes implicit the\nunderstanding of IS is essential to create competitive companies, to manage\nglobal corporations and provide customers with products and services of value.\nIn this work we are correlating IS with the governance of management of an\necosystem. Yet, as IT is redefining the foundations of business, then the\ncustomer service, operations, strategies of product marketing and its\ndistribution and even the knowledge management (KM) depends very much, or\nsometimes even completely, on the IS. The IT and its costs have become a part\nof day-to-day business [02].

Based on a delay model proposed by Sotiriadis et al.,\ntransition patterns over a bus can be classified according to their delays.\nUsing this classification, crosstalk avoidance codes (CACs) have been proposed\nto alleviate the crosstalk delays by restricting the transition patterns on a\nbus. In this paper, we first propose a new classification of transition\npatterns, and then devise a new family of CACs based on this classification. In\ncomparison to the previous classification, our classification has more classes\nand the delays of its classes do not overlap, both leading to more accurate\ncontrol of delays. Our new family of CACs includes some previously proposed\ncodes as well as new codes with reduced delays and improved throughput. Thus,\nthis new family of crosstalk avoidance codes provides a wider variety of\ntradeoffs between bus delay and efficiency. Finally, since our analytical\napproach to the classification and CACs treats the technology-dependent\nparameters as variables, our approach can be easily adapted to a wide variety\nof technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 17:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-13"}

It follows that the maximization\nof QN must accomodate two factors pulling in opposite directions: Qf favors a\nsmall number of clusters and Q0 favors many balanced (i.e., with approximately\nequal degrees) clusters. In certain cases the Q0 term can cause overestimation\nof the true cluster number; this is the opposite of the well-known under\nestimation effect caused by the \"resolution limit\" of modularity. We illustrate\nthe overestimation effect by constructing families of graphs with a \"natural\"\ncommunity structure which, however, does not maximize modularity.

The region of strong gravity that develops\nwhen matter collapses to form the blackhole remains visible to the whole of\nspacetime and has to be described by a microscopic theory of strong gravity.\nThe arguments imply that the information paradox is demoted from a paradox\ninvolving fundamental principles of physics to the problem of describing how\nmatter at the highest densities gravitates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 18:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-13"}

Recent advances in\nbiology have encouraged using genetically engineered bacteria as the main\ncomponent in the molecular communication. This has stimulated a new line of\nresearch that attempts to study molecular communication among bacteria from an\ninformation-theoretic point of view. Due to high randomness in the individual\nbehavior of the bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria is\nalmost impossible. Therefore, we recently proposed that a population of\nbacteria in a cluster is considered as a node capable of molecular transmission\nand reception. This proposition enables us to form a reliable node out of many\nunreliable bacteria. The bacteria inside a node sense the environment and\nrespond accordingly. In this paper, we study the communication between two\nnodes, one acting as the transmitter and the other as the receiver. We consider\nthe case in which the information is encoded in the concentration of molecules\nby the transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter\nnode propagate in the environment via the diffusion process. Then, their\nconcentration sensed by the bacteria in the receiver node would decode the\ninformation. The randomness in the communication is caused by both the error in\nthe molecular production at the transmitter and the reception of molecules at\nthe receiver. We study the theoretical limits of the information transfer rate\nin such a setup versus the number of bacteria per node. Finally, we consider\nM-ary modulation schemes and study the achievable rates and their error\nprobabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 18:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-13"}

However, particle physics experiments are\nexpensive and time consuming to carry out, thus if an analysis has inherent\nbias (even if unintentional), much money and effort can be wasted trying to\nreplicate or understand the results, particularly if the analysis is\nfundamental to our understanding of the universe.\n  In this note we discuss the significant biases that can result from data\nbinning schemes. As we will show, if data are binned such that they provide the\nbest comparison to a particular (but incorrect) model, the resulting model\nparameter estimates when fitting to the binned data can be significantly\nbiased, leading us to too often accept the model hypothesis when it is not in\nfact true. When using binned likelihood or least squares methods there is of\ncourse no a priori requirement that data bin sizes need to be constant, but we\nshow that fitting to data grouped into variable width bins is particularly\nprone to produce biased results if the bin boundaries are chosen to optimize\nthe comparison of the binned data to a wrong model. The degree of bias that can\nbe achieved simply with variable binning can be surprisingly large.\n  Fitting the data with an unbinned likelihood method, when possible to do so,\nis the best way for researchers to show their analyses are not biased by\nbinning effects. Failing that, equal bin widths should be employed as a\ncross-check of the fitting analysis whenever possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 18:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-13"}

By comparing with the flare parameters\nobtained from other UV Ceti type stars, we examine the behaviour of optical\nflare processes along the spectral types. Moreover, we aimed, using large\nwhite-light flare data,to analyse the flare time-scales in respect to some\nresults obtained from the X-ray observations. Using the SPSS V17.0 and the\nGraphPad Prism V5.02 software, the flares detected from CR Dra were modelled\nwith the OPEA function and analysed with t-Test method to compare similar flare\nevents in other stars. In addition, using some regression calculations in order\nto derive the best histograms, the time-scales of the white-light flares were\nanalysed. Firstly, CR Dra flares have revealed that the white-light flares\nbehave in a similar way as their counterparts observed in X-rays. As seen in\nX-ray observations, the electron density seems to be a dominant parameter in\nwhite-light flare process, too. Secondly, the distributions of the flare\ntime-scales demonstrate that the number of observed flares gets a maximum value\nin some particular ratios, which are 0.5 or its multiples, and especially\npositive integers. The thermal processes might be dominant for these\nwhite-light flares, while non-thermal processes might be dominant in the\nothers.

In\nparticular, a geometric measure of asymmetric discord [Dakic et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 105, 190502 (2010)] was recently defined as the Hilbert-Schmidt distance\nof a given two-qubit state to the closest classical-quantum (CQ) correlated\nstate. We analyze a geometric measure of symmetric discord defined as the\nHilbert-Schmidt distance of a given state to the closest classical-classical\n(CC) correlated state. The optimal member of $\\Omega$ is just specially\nmeasured original state both for the CQ and CC discords. This implies that this\nmeasure is equal to quantum deficit of post-measurement purity. We discuss some\ngeneral relations between the CC discords and explain why an analytical formula\nfor the CC discord, contrary to the CQ discord, can hardly be found even for a\ngeneral two-qubit state. Instead of such exact formula, we find simple\nanalytical measurement-based upper bounds for the CC discord which, as we show,\nare very efficient in the case of two qubits and may serve as independent\nindicators of two-party quantum correlations. In particular, we propose an\nadaptive upper bound, which corresponds to the optimal states induced by\nsingle-party measurements: optimal measurement on one of the parties determines\nan optimal measurement on the other party. We discuss how to refine the\nadaptive upper bound by nonoptimal single-party measurements and by an\niterative procedure which usually rapidly converges to the CC discord.

Our previous work showed that the near-infrared Ca II triplet line\nstrength varied more than expected for a chemically homogeneous cluster, and\nthat at least one star had unusual abundances of Mg and K. Here, we confirm\nthat NGC 2419 harbors a population of stars, comprising about one third of its\nmass, that is depleted in Mg by a factor of 8 and enhanced in K by a factor of\n6 with respect to the Mg-normal population. Although the majority, Mg-normal\npopulation appears to have a chemical abundance pattern indistinguishable from\nordinary, inner halo globular clusters, the Mg-poor population exhibits\ndispersions of several elements. The abundances of K and Sc are strongly\nanti-correlated with Mg, and some other elements (Si and Ca among others) are\nweakly anti-correlated with Mg. These abundance patterns suggest that the\ndifferent populations of NGC 2419 sample the ejecta of diverse supernovae in\naddition to AGB ejecta. However, the abundances of Fe-peak elements except Sc\nshow no star-to-star variation. We find no nucleosynthetic source that\nsatisfactorily explains all of the abundance variations in this cluster.\nBecause NGC 2419 appears like no other globular cluster, we reiterate our\nprevious suggestion that it is not a globular cluster at all, but rather the\ncore of an accreted dwarf galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 17:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 19:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

We use far-infrared data from the\nGOODS-Herschel survey to show that most DOGs with 10^12 L_Sun < L_IR < 10^13\nL_Sun are not abnormally bright in the mid-IR when compared to other dusty\ngalaxies with similar IR (8--1000um) luminosities. We observe a relation\nbetween the median IR to UV luminosity ratios and the median UV continuum\npower-law indices for these galaxies, and we find that only 24% have specific\nstar formation rates which indicate the dominance of compact star-forming\nregions. This circumstantial evidence supports the idea that the UV- and\nIR-emitting regions in these galaxies are spatially coincident, which implies a\nconnection between the abnormal UV faintness of DOGs and dust obscuration. We\nconclude that the range in rest-frame mid-IR to UV flux density ratios spanned\nby dusty galaxies at z ~ 2 is due to differing amounts of UV obscuration. Of\ngalaxies with these IR luminosities, DOGs are the most obscured.

Here we present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that\nsystematically explore the effect of adding a single nuclear reaction to a\nviscous torus. The equation of state, anomalous shear stress, and nuclear\nreactions are given parametric forms. Our results point to the existence of two\nqualitatively different regimes of NuDAF evolution: (1) steady accretion with\nquiescent burning; or (2) detonation of the disk. These outcomes are controlled\nprimarily by the ratio of the nuclear energy released to the enthalpy at the\nburning radius. Disks detonate if this ratio exceeds a critical value (~1), and\nif burning occurs in regions where neutrino cooling is unimportant.\nThermonuclear runaways are seeded by the turbulent mixing of hot ash with cold\nfuel at the burning front. Subcritical disks do not explode, but instead power\na persistent collimated outflow of unbound material composed primarily of ash,\nwith a mass-loss rate that increases with the nuclear binding energy released.\nWe discuss the implications of our results for supernova-like counterparts from\nastrophysical events in the NuDAF regime.

Since that time it has had enormous impact in many\napplication domains because of its robustness and ease of implementation, and\nnumerical evidence of its accuracy. In this paper we propose the application of\nan iterative ensemble Kalman method for the solution of a wide class of inverse\nproblems. In this context we show that the estimate of the unknown function\nthat we obtain with the ensemble Kalman method lies in a subspace A spanned by\nthe initial ensemble. Hence the resulting error may be bounded above by the\nerror found from the best approximation in this subspace. We provide numerical\nexperiments which compare the error incurred by the ensemble Kalman method for\ninverse problems with the error of the best approximation in A, and with\nvariants on traditional least-squares approaches, restricted to the subspace A.\nIn so doing we demonstrate that the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems\nprovides a derivative-free optimization method with comparable accuracy to that\nachieved by traditional least-squares approaches. Furthermore, we also\ndemonstrate that the accuracy is of the same order of magnitude as that\nachieved by the best approximation. Three examples are used to demonstrate\nthese assertions: inversion of a compact linear operator; inversion of\npiezometric head to determine hydraulic conductivity in a Darcy model of\ngroundwater flow; and inversion of Eulerian velocity measurements at positive\ntimes to determine the initial condition in an incompressible fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 21:19:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2012 17:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2013 18:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-08"}

We present qualitative comparisons of synthetic\nVLA observations of simulated galaxy clusters to radio observations of Faraday\nRotation Measure (RM) and radio halos. The cluster formation is modeled using\nadaptive mesh refinement (AMR) magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the\nassumption that the initial magnetic fields are injected into the ICM by active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. In addition to simulated clusters in\nXu et al. (2010, 2011), we present a new simulation with magnetic field\ninjections from multiple AGNs. We find that the cluster with multiple injection\nsources is magnetized to a similar level as in previous simulations with a\nsingle AGN. The RM profiles from simulated clusters, both $|RM|$ and the\ndispersion of RM ($\\sigma_{RM}$), are consistent at a first-order with the\nradial distribution from observations. The correlations between the\n$\\sigma_{RM}$ and X-ray surface brightness from simulations are in a broad\nagreement with the observations, although there is an indication that the\nsimulated clusters could be slightly over-dense and less magnetized with\nrespect to those in the observed sample. In addition, the simulated radio halos\nagree with the observed correlations between the radio power versus the cluster\nX-ray luminosity and between the radio power versus the radio halo size.

These include the implications of a\nperturbative connection to a large scale; Yukawa couplings, which must be\ngenerated from higher-dimensional operators in many constructions; anomaly\ncancellation, in particular the implications of the required exotics for the\naxigluon width, perturbativity, and the signatures from exotic decays; the\npossibility of family nonuniversality via mirror representations, mixing with\nexotics, or additional SU(3) factors; the additional constraints from anomalous\nU(1) factors in the string constructions; tadpole cancellation, which implies\nnew uncolored matter; the prevention of string-scale masses for vector pairs;\nand various phenomenological issues involving FCNC, CKM constraints, and the\naxigluon coupling strength.

We employ two different hydrodynamic codes to perform\n2D-axisymmetric and 3D simulations that examine the long-term evolution of the\ndisc models as a function of the power-law indices of the temperature or\nentropy, the thermal relaxation time of the fluid, and the viscosity. We\npresent a stability analysis of the problem that we use to interpret the\nsimulation results. We find that disc models whose temperature or entropy\nprofiles cause the equilibrium angular velocity to vary with height are\nunstable to the growth of modes with wavenumber ratios |k_R/k_Z| >> 1 when the\nthermodynamic response of the fluid is isothermal, or the thermal evolution\ntime is comparable to or shorter than the local dynamical time scale.

A\ndifferential approach is used to quantify the changes in theoretical equivalent\nwidth of a set of 28 iron spectral lines spanning a wide range in lambda,\nexcitation potential, oscillator strength, Land\\'e factor, and formation\nheight. The lines were computed in LTE using the spectral synthesis code LILIA.\nWe used input magnetoconvection snapshots covering 50 minutes of solar\nevolution and belonging to series having an average vertical magnetic flux\ndensity of 0, 50, 100 and 200 G. For the relevant calculations we used the\nCopenhagen Stagger code. The presence of magnetic fields causes both a direct\n(Zeeman-broadening) effect on spectral lines with non-zero Land\\'e factor and\nan indirect effect on temperature-sensitive lines via a change in the\nphotospheric T-tau stratification. The corresponding correction in the\nestimated atomic abundance ranges from a few hundredths of a dex up to |Delta\nlog(Fe)| ~ 0.15 dex, depending on the spectral line and on the amount of\naverage magnetic flux within the range of values we considered. The\nZeeman-broadening effect gains relatively more importance in the IR. The\nlargest modification to previous solar abundance determinations based on\nvisible spectral lines is instead due to the indirect effect, i.e., the\nline-weakening caused by a warmer stratification on an optical depth scale. Our\nresults indicate that the average solar iron abundance obtained when using\nmagnetoconvection models can be 0.03-0.11 dex higher than when using the\nsimpler HD convection approach.

The search for an optical counterpart did not yield any\nstellar object brighter than 20 mag, suggesting that XMMU J013359.5+303634 is\nnot a Galactic foreground object and almost certainly belongs to M33. Assuming\nthe distance of 817 kpc, the maximum observed luminosity of the source in the\n0.3-10 keV energy range is ~1.4e37 ergs/s, at least 20 times higher than\nquiescent luminosity. The brightest optical object inside the error circle of\nXMMU J013359.5+303634 has a visual magnitude of 20.9 and properties consistent\nwith being an early B V star when placed at a distance of M33.

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

Thus, molecular\nnegative ions received minor attention until their possible existence was\nobservationally confirmed (discovery of the first interstellar anion, C6H-),\nabout thirty years after the first physically reasonable proposal on their\nactual detection was theoretically surmised by E.Herbst. In an astrophysical\ncontext, their role should be then found in their involvement in the charge\nbalance as well as in the chemical evolution of the considered environment:\ndepending on their amount and on the global gas density, in fact, the possible\nevolutive scenario could be susceptible of marked variations on the estimated\ntime needed for reaching the steady state, their presence having thus also\nimportant repercussions on the final chemical composition of a given\nenvironment. The main reasons that originally motivated us to undertake the\npresent work, were at least two. First of all, we intended to demonstrate the\nimportance of resonances in forming molecular anions in different astrophysical\nenvironments. Secondly, we were attracted by the possibility of investigating\nthe occurrence of radiationless paths like intramolecular vibrational\nredistributions to account for the dissipation of the extra energy initially\ncarried by the impinging electron. Accordingly, the present PhD represents a\ntheoretical/computational work which deals with an area placed at the boundary\nbetween (molecular) astrophysics, quantum collision thery, and theoretical\nchemistry. The three molecular species whose behaviour under low-energy\nelectron collisions will be discussed are: the ortho-benzyne, the coronene and\nthe carbon nitride.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 09:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-14"}

In particular, when a\nquasi-two-dimensional monolayer of mono-disperse non-cohesive particles is\nvertically vibrated, a solid-liquid-like transition occurs when the driving\namplitude exceeds a critical value. Here, the physical mechanism underlying\nparticle clustering relies on the strong interactions mediated by grain\ncollisions, rather than on grain-grain cohesive forces. In average, the solid\ncluster resembles a drop, with a striking circular shape. We experimentally\ninvestigate the coarse-grained solid-liquid interface fluctuations, which are\ncharacterized through the static and dynamic correlation functions in the\nFourier space. These fluctuations turn out to be well described by the\ncapillary wave theory, which allows us to measure the solid-liquid interface\nsurface tension and mobility once the granular \"thermal\" kinetic energy is\ndetermined. Despite the system is strongly out of equilibrium and that the\ngranular temperature is not uniform, there is energy equipartition at the\nsolid-liquid interface, for a relatively large range of angular wave-numbers.\nFurthermore, both surface tension and mobility are consistent with a simple\norder of magnitude estimation considering the characteristic energy, length and\ntime scales, which is very similar to what can be done for atomic systems.\n  Please find the supplementary material of this article here: arXiv:1304.2646\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 09:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 11:50:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 00:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The processor features dynamic speed scaling\nas well as suspension to a sleep mode. Jobs arrive over time, are preemptable,\nand have different sizes, values, and deadlines. On the arrival of a new job,\nthe scheduler may either accept or reject the job. Accepted jobs need a certain\nenergy investment to be finished in time, while rejected jobs cause costs equal\nto their values. Here, power consumption at speed $s$ is given by\n$P(s)=s^{\\alpha}+\\beta$ and the energy investment is power integrated over\ntime. Additionally, the scheduler may decide to suspend the processor to a\nsleep mode in which no energy is consumed, though awaking entails fixed\ntransition costs $\\gamma$.

The inflow should be\nconfined to the common equatorial plane of the torus and the accretion disc and\nhave a radial optical depth of 1 < tau < 3.

The method\nemployed in this paper is a BC-type adaptation of techniques used in an earlier\nwork of the author, which gave a combinatorial method for proving vanishing\nresults of Rains and Vazirani at the Hall-Littlewood level. As a consequence of\nthis work, we obtain direct arguments for the constant term evaluations and\nnorms in both the symmetric and nonsymmetric cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 15:35:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 20:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-13"}

This technique\ncapitalizes on the absorption properties of Hydrogen and Helium at different\nwavelength ranges and temperature regimes. Several cases where this technique\ncan be successfully applied are described. This technique works best when\nprominence plasmas are hotter than 15,000 K and thus it is ideally suited for\nrapidly heating erupting prominences observed during the initial phases of\ncoronal mass ejections. An example is made using simulated intensities of 4\nchannels of the SDO/AIA instrument.

We find\nthat flow quantities, such as the energy density or the local Lorentz factor,\nshow large spatial variance even in the subsonic case as compressibility is\nenhanced by relativistic effects. The velocity field is highly intermittent,\nbut its power-spectrum is found to be in good agreement with the predictions of\nthe classical theory of Kolmogorov.
