Given a\nnetwork, the network coding solvability problem decides whether all the packets\nrequested by the destinations can be transmitted. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew approach to this problem. We define a closure operator on a digraph closely\nrelated to the network coding instance and we show that the constraints for\nnetwork coding can all be expressed according to that closure operator. Thus, a\nsolution for the network coding problem is equivalent to a so-called solution\nof the closure operator. We can then define the closure solvability problem in\ngeneral, which surprisingly reduces to finding secret-sharing matroids when the\nclosure operator is a matroid. Based on this reformulation, we can easily prove\nthat any multiple unicast where each node receives at least as many arcs as\nthere are sources is solvable by linear functions. We also give an alternative\nproof that any nontrivial multiple unicast with two source-receiver pairs is\nalways solvable over all sufficiently large alphabets. Based on singular\nproperties of the closure operator, we are able to generalise the way in which\nnetworks can be split into two distinct parts; we also provide a new way of\nidentifying and removing useless nodes in a network. We also introduce the\nconcept of network sharing, where one solvable network can be used to\naccommodate another solvable network coding instance. Finally, the guessing\ngraph approach to network coding solvability is generalised to any closure\noperator, which yields bounds on the amount of information that can be\ntransmitted through a network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 16:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 14:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 17:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}

The\nreliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering,\ni.e., time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike trains.\nAdditional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging as\nwell as the instantaneous comparison of spike train groups. In a second step, a\ncausal SPIKE-distance is defined such that the instantaneous values of\ndissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train\nsynchrony can be estimated in real-time. We demonstrate that these methods are\ncapable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the\nsynchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure.

A crucial step toward verifying such evidence is the measurement of the\nwould-be dark matter mass. If, for example, the invisible particles are found\nto have masses consistent with zero, it may prove very challenging to ascertain\nwhether light dark matter or neutrinos are being observed. We assume that new\ninvisible particles are pair-produced in a ttbar-like topology and use two\nMT2-based methods to measure the masses of the particles associated with the\nmissing energy. Instead of simulating events and backgrounds, we estimate the\nuncertainty associated with measuring the mass of the invisible particle by\nassuming a fixed value of the uncertainty associated with the location of the\nMT2 endpoint. We find that if this uncertainty associated with measuring the\nMT2 endpoints is, quite optimistically, O(1 GeV), the invisible particles must\nhave masses greater than O(10 GeV) so they can be distinguished from massless\nones at 95% CL. If the results from the CoGeNT, DAMA/LIBRA, and CRESST\nexperiments have indeed revealed the existence of light dark matter with mass\nO(10 GeV), our results suggest that it may be difficult for the LHC to\ndistinguish dark matter from neutrinos solely via mass measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 19:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

As the resonator constitutes an open driven and\ndamped system, the dynamics is non-conservative and in general enables cooling\nand confining the motion of polarizable particles. In addition, the emitted\ncavity field allows for real-time monitoring of the particle's position with\nminimal perturbation up to sub-wavelength accuracy.

To properly\nconstrain the dark matter cross-section it is necessary to understand the\ndynamics of the merger, as the inferred cross-section is a function of both the\nvelocity of the collision and the observed time since collision. While the best\nunderstanding of merging system dynamics comes from N-body simulations, these\nare computationally intensive and often explore only a limited volume of the\nmerger phase space allowed by observed parameter uncertainty. Simple analytic\nmodels exist but the assumptions of these methods invalidate their results near\nthe collision time, plus error propagation of the highly correlated merger\nparameters is unfeasible. To address these weaknesses I develop a Monte Carlo\nmethod to discern the properties of dissociative mergers and propagate the\nuncertainty of the measured cluster parameters in an accurate and Bayesian\nmanner. I introduce this method, verify it against an existing hydrodynamic\nN-body simulation, and apply it to two known dissociative mergers: 1ES 0657-558\n(Bullet Cluster) and DLSCL J0916.2+2951 (Musket Ball Cluster). I find that this\nmethod surpasses existing analytic models - providing accurate (10% level)\ndynamic parameter and uncertainty estimates throughout the merger history.

This birth of a relativistic jet may have\nbeen observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs), which\nwere discovered in gamma-rays by Swift. Yet no transient radio emission has\nbeen detected from the tens of TDF candidates that were discovered at optical\nto soft X-ray frequencies. Because the sample that was followed-up at radio\nfrequencies is small, the non-detections can be explained by Doppler boosting,\nwhich reduces the jet flux for off-axis observers. And since the existing\nfollow-up observation are mostly within ~10 months of the discovery, the\nnon-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio emission with respect to\nthe time of disruption. To test the conjecture that all TDFs launch jets, we\nobtained 5 GHz follow-up observations with the Jansky VLA of seven known TDFs.\nTo avoid missing delayed jet emission, our observations probe 1-8 years since\nthe estimated time of disruption. None of the sources are detected, with very\ndeep upper limits at the 10 micro Jansky level. These observations rule out the\nhypothesis that these TDFs launched jets similar to radio-loud quasars. We also\nconstrain the possibility that the flares hosted a jet identical to Sw 1644+57,\nthe first and best-sampled relativistic TDF. We thus obtain evidence for a\ndichotomy in the stellar tidal disruption population, implying that the jet\nlaunching mechanism is sensitive to the parameters of the disruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 20:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2013 08:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-14"}

The calculation employs a 2+1-flavor\nmixed-action lattice scheme, thus treating the strange quark degrees of freedom\nin dynamical fashion. Numerical results are obtained at three pion masses, m_pi\n= 495 MeV, 356 MeV, and 293 MeV, renormalized, and chirally extrapolated to the\nphysical pion mass. The value extracted for Delta s at the physical pion mass\nin the MSbar scheme at a scale of 2 GeV is Delta s = -0.031(17), whereas the\nstrange quark contribution to the nucleon mass amounts to f_Ts =0.046(11). In\nthe employed mixed-action scheme, the nucleon valence quarks as well as the\nstrange quarks entering the nucleon matrix elements which determine f_Ts and\nDelta s are realized as domain wall fermions, propagators of which are\nevaluated in MILC 2+1-flavor dynamical asqtad quark ensembles.

The goal is to reproduce a thematic map that will be compared with a\nreference ground truth map (GT), constructed by expecting the region. The HIS\ncontains more than a hundred bidirectional measures, called bands (or simply\nimages), of the same region. They are taken at juxtaposed frequencies.\nUnfortunately, some bands contain redundant information, others are affected by\nthe noise, and the high dimensionality of features made the accuracy of\nclassification lower. The problematic is how to find the good bands to classify\nthe pixels of regions. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and threshold,\nto select relevant bands, without treatment of redundancy. Others control and\neliminate redundancy by selecting the band top ranking the MI, and if its\nneighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered\nredundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method,\nbecause this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious\ninformation can be discarded. In this paper we'll accept the useful redundancy.\nA band contains useful redundancy if it contributes to produce an estimated\nreference map that has higher MI with the GT.nTo control redundancy, we\nintroduce a complementary threshold added to last value of MI.

With the lower approximation operator in\nthe new parametric rough sets, a backward algorithm is designed for the rule\nmining problem. Experiments on two real world data sets show that the new\nalgorithm is significantly faster than the existing sandwich algorithm. This\nstudy indicates a new application area, namely recommender systems, of\nrelational data mining, granular computing and rough sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 01:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 11:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

It was generally believed that this reflects a\ndifferent physical origin: Collapsars (long) and non-Collapsars (short). We\nhave recently shown that the duration distribution of Collapsars is flat,\nnamely independent of the duration, at short durations. Using this model for\nthe distribution of Collapsars we determine the duration distribution of\nnon-Collapsars and estimate the probability that a burst with a given duration\n(and hardness) is a Collapsar or not. We find that this probability depends\nstrongly on the spectral window of the observing detector. While the commonly\nused limit of 2 sec is conservative and suitable for BATSE bursts, 40% of\nswift's bursts shorter than 2 sec are Collapsars and division >/<0.8 sec is\nmore suitable for swift. We find that the duration overlap of the two\npopulations is very large. On the one hand there is a non-negligible fraction\nof non-Collapsars longer than 10 sec, while on the other hand even bursts\nshorter than 0.5 sec in the swift sample have a non-negligible probability to\nbe Collapsars. Our results enable the construction of non-Collapsar samples\nwhile controlling the Collapsar contamination. They also highlight that no firm\nconclusions can be drawn based on a single burst and they have numerous\nimplications concerning previous studies of non-Collapsar properties that were\nbased on the current significantly contaminated swift samples of localized\nshort GRBs. Specifically: (i) all known short bursts with z>1 are most likely\nCollapsars, (ii) the only short burst with a clear jet break is most likely a\nCollapsar, indicating our lack of knowledge concerning non-Collapsar beaming\n(iii) the existence of non-Collapsars with durations up to 10 sec impose new\nchallenges to non-Collapsar models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 01:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The detection of non-thermal emission from SNRs\ndemonstrates the presence of energetic particles, but direct signatures of\nprotons and other ions remain elusive. If these particles receive a sizeable\nfraction of the explosion energy, the morphological and spectral evolution of\nthe SNR must be modified. To assess this, we run 3D hydrodynamic simulations of\na remnant coupled with a non-linear acceleration model. We obtain the\ntime-dependent evolution of the shocked structure, impacted by the\nRayleigh-Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities at the contact discontinuity and by\nthe back-reaction of particles at the forward shock. We then compute the\nprogressive temperature equilibration and non-equilibrium ionization state of\nthe plasma, and its thermal emission in each cell. This allows us to produce\nthe first realistic synthetic maps of the projected X-ray emission from the\nSNR. Plasma conditions (temperature, ionization age) can vary widely over the\nprojected surface of the SNR, especially between the ejecta and the ambient\nmedium owing to their different composition. This demonstrates the need for\nspatially-resolved spectroscopy. We find that the integrated emission is\nreduced with particle back-reaction, with the effect being more significant for\nthe highest photon energies. Therefore different energy bands, corresponding to\ndifferent emitting elements, probe different levels of the impact of particle\nacceleration. Our work provides a framework for the interpretation of SNR\nobservations with current X-ray missions (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Suzaku) and with\nupcoming X-ray missions (such as Astro-H).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 06:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

During a computational episode,\nactivations are spreading from input neurons through the SLIM NN until the\ncomputation activates a special halt neuron. Weights of the NN's used\nconnections define its program. Halting programs form a prefix code. The reset\nof the initial NN state does not cost more than the latest program execution.\nSince prefixes of SLIM programs influence their suffixes (weight changes\noccurring early in an episode influence which weights are considered later),\nSLIM NN learning algorithms (LAs) should execute weight changes online during\nactivation spreading. This can be achieved by applying AOPS to growing SLIM\nNNs. To efficiently teach a SLIM NN to solve many tasks, such as correctly\nclassifying many different patterns, or solving many different robot control\ntasks, each connection keeps a list of tasks it is used for.
