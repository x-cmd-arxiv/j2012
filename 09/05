The\nform factors are all approximated by a simple dipole function, normalized to\nthe charge or magnetic moment of the nucleon. The differences between the\nproton and neutron form factors and the deviation of GEn from zero are\nsensitive to the difference between up- and down-quark contributions to the\nform factors.\n  Methods: We combine recent measurements of the neutron form factors with\nupdated extractions of the proton form factors, accounting for two-photon\nexchange corrections and including an estimate of the uncertainties for all of\nthe form factors to obtain a complete set of measurements up to Q^2\napproximately 4 (GeV/c)^2. We use this to extract the up- and down-quark\ncontributions which we compare to recent fits and calculations.\n  Results: We find a large differences between the up- and down-quark\ncontributions to G_E and G_M, implying significant flavor dependence in the\ncharge and magnetization distributions. The rapid falloff of the ratio GEp/GMp\ndoes not appear in the individual quark form factors, but arises from a\ncancellation between the up- and down-quark contributions. We see indications\nthat the down-quark contributions to the Dirac and Pauli form factors deviate\nfrom the suggested 1/Q^4 scaling behavior suggested by a previous analysis.\nFinally, while recent models provide a generally good qualitative description\nof the data, the down-quark contribution to G_E/G_M and F_2/F_1 are not\nreproduced by any of the models. Finally, we note that while the inclusion of\nrecent $\\gmn$ data from CLAS modifies the high-$Q^2$ slightly, the tension\nbetween these data and previous measurements at lower $Q^2$ has a more\nsignificant impact, suggesting the need for additional data in this region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 16:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2012 18:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Its flexible\ntemplate scaling increases the sensitivity to slope changes and small scale\nfeatures in the spectrum, while a new selection algorithm called Maximum\nCombined Pseudo-Likelihood (MCPL) provides increased accuracy and a lower\nnumber of outliers compared to the standard maximum-likelihood (ML) approach.\nUnlike ML, MCPL searches for local (instead of absolute) maxima of a\n'pseudo-likelihood' (PL) function, and combines results obtained for all the\ntemplates in the library to weed out spurious redshift solutions. The\ncapabilities of MCPL are demonstrated by comparing its results to those of\nregular ML and to the optical spectroscopic redshifts of a sample of 491\nSpitzer/IRS spectra from sources at 0<z<3.7. MCPL achieves a redshift accuracy\ndz/(1+z)<0.005 for 78% of the galaxies in the sample compared to 68% for ML.\nThe rate of outliers (dz/(1+z)>0.02) is 14% for MCPL and 22% for ML. chi^2\nvalues for ML solutions are found to correlate with the SNR of the spectra, but\nnot with redshift accuracy. By contrast, the peak value of the normalised\ncombined PL (gamma) is found to provide a good indication on the reliability of\nthe MCPL solution for individual sources. The accuracy and reliability of the\nredshifts depends strongly on the MIR SED. Sources with significant polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon emission obtain much better results compared to sources\ndominated by AGN continuum. Nevertheless, for a given gamma the frequency of\naccurate solutions and outliers is largely independent on their SED type. This\nreliability indicator for MCPL solutions allows to select subsamples with\nhighly reliable redshifts. In particular, a gamma>0.15 threshold retains 79% of\nthe sources with dz/(1+z)<0.005 while reducing the outlier rate to 3.8%\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 16:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A complete stability analysis is\ndone for the background inflaton evolution equations, which includes both\ninflaton dissipation and radiation bulk viscous effects. Three representative\napproaches of bulk viscous irreversible thermodynamics are analyzed: the Eckart\nnoncausal theory, the linear and causal theory of Israel-Stewart and a more\nrecent nonlinear and causal bulk viscous theory. It is found that the causal\ntheories allow for larger bulk viscosities before encountering an instability\nin comparison to the noncausal Eckart theory.

The study of stochastic switching circuits has\nwidespread applications in many fields of computer science, neuroscience, and\nbiochemistry. In this paper, we discuss several properties of stochastic\nswitching circuits, including robustness, expressibility, and probability\napproximation.\n  First, we study the robustness, namely, the effect caused by introducing an\nerror of size \\epsilon to each pswitch in a stochastic circuit. We analyze two\nconstructions and prove that simple series-parallel circuits are robust to\nsmall error perturbations, while general series-parallel circuits are not.\nSpecifically, the total error introduced by perturbations of size less than\n\\epsilon is bounded by a constant multiple of \\epsilon in a simple\nseries-parallel circuit, independent of the size of the circuit.\n  Next, we study the expressibility of stochastic switching circuits: Given an\ninteger q and a pswitch set S=\\{\\frac{1}{q},\\frac{2}{q},...,\\frac{q-1}{q}\\},\ncan we synthesize any rational probability with denominator q^n (for arbitrary\nn) with a simple series-parallel stochastic switching circuit? We generalize\nprevious results and prove that when q is a multiple of 2 or 3, the answer is\nyes.

Ecologists and social scientists have described many ways that\nindividuals can be important; This paper makes two key contributions to this\nresearch area. First, it shows that throughflow, the total energy-matter\nentering or exiting a system component, is a global indicator of the relative\ncontribution of the component to the whole system activity. It is global\nbecause it includes the direct and indirect exchanges among community members.\nFurther, throughflow is a special case of Hubbell status as defined in social\nscience. This recognition effectively joins the concepts, enabling ecologists\nto use and build on the broader centrality research in network science. Second,\nI characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically-based trophic\necosystem models. Consistent with expectations, this analysis shows that a\nsmall fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the\nsystem activity. In 73% of the ecosystem models, 20% or less of the nodes\ngenerate 80% or more of the total system throughflow. Four or fewer dominant\nnodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity. 121 of the\n130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary\nproducers, dead organic matter, or bacteria. Thus, throughflow centrality\nindicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the power\nconcentration in the primary production and decomposition cycle. Although these\nresults are specific to ecosystems, these techniques build on flow analysis\nbased on economic input-output analysis. Therefore these results should be\nuseful for ecosystem ecology, industrial ecology, the study of urban\nmetabolism, as well as other domains using input-output analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 18:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-24"}

Using sensitive microwave observations we revisit\nthis finding made by Battaglia et al. (2009) based on RHESSI data analysis. We\nhave found that nonthermal microwave emission produced by accelerated electrons\nwith energy of at least several hundred keV, appears as early as the thermal\nsoft X-ray emission indicative that the electron acceleration takes place at\nthe very early flare phase. The non-detection of the hard X-rays at that early\nstage of the flares is, thus, an artifact of a limited RHESSI sensitivity. In\nall considered events, the microwave emission intensity increases at the early\nflare phase. We found that either thermal or nonthermal gyrosynchrotron\nemission can dominate the low-frequency part of the microwave spectrum below\nthe spectral peak occurring at 3-10 GHz. In contrast, the high-frequency\noptically thin part of the spectrum is always formed by the nonthermal,\naccelerated electron component, whose power-law energy spectrum can extend up\nto a few MeV at this early flare stage. This means that even though the total\nnumber of accelerated electrons is small at this stage, their nonthermal\nspectrum is fully developed. This implies that an acceleration process of\navailable seed particles is fully operational. While, creation of this seed\npopulation (the process commonly called `injection' of the particles from the\nthermal pool into acceleration) has a rather low efficiency at this stage,\nalthough, the plasma heating efficiency is high. This imbalance between the\nheating and acceleration (in favor of the heating) is difficult to reconcile\nwithin most of available flare energization models. Being reminiscent of the\ntradeoff between the Joule heating and runaway electron acceleration, it puts\nadditional constraints on the electron injection into the acceleration process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 18:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This case is called {\\it\nlow-frequency} nanoflare heating and we investigate its feasibility as an\nactive region heating scenario here. We explore a parameter space of heating\nand coronal loop properties with a hydrodynamic model. For each model run, we\ncalculate the slope $\\alpha$ of the emission measure distribution $EM(T)\n\\propto T^\\alpha$. Our conclusions are: (1) low-frequency nanoflare heating is\nconsistent with about 36% of observed active region cores when uncertainties in\nthe atomic data are not accounted for; (2) proper consideration of\nuncertainties yields a range in which as many as 77% of observed active regions\nare consistent with low-frequency nanoflare heating and as few as zero; (3)\nlow-frequency nanoflare heating cannot explain observed slopes greater than 3;\n(4) the upper limit to the volumetric energy release is in the region of 50 erg\ncm$^{-3}$ to avoid unphysical magnetic field strengths; (5) the heating\ntimescale may be short for loops of total length less than 40 Mm to be\nconsistent with the observed range of slopes; (6) predicted slopes are\nconsistently steeper for longer loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 19:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We\nsystematically investigate the dependence of the energization process on\ninitial position, initial energy and initial pitch angle.\n  Results. We find that in our symmetric trap model particles can gain up to\nabout 50 times their initial energy, but that for most initial conditions the\nenergy gain is more moderate. Particles with an initial position in the weak\nfield region of the collapsing trap and with pitch angles around 90 degrees\nachieve the highest energy gain, with betatron acceleration of the\nperpendicular energy the dominant energization mechanism. For particles with\nsmaller initial pitch angle, but still outside the loss cone, we find the\npossibility of a significant increase in parallel energy.

Here we introduce TAM waves, solutions of fixed total angular\nmomentum to the Helmholtz equation, for three-dimensional scalar, vector, and\ntensor fields. The vector TAM waves of given total angular momentum can be\ndecomposed further into a set of three basis functions of fixed orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM), a set of fixed helicity, or a basis consisting of a\nlongitudinal (L) and two transverse (E and B) TAM waves.

An alternative is\nto ascribe the radiation around the spectral peak to a thermalization process\noccurring well inside the Thomson photosphere. This quasi-thermal spectrum can\nevolve into the observed non-thermal shape by additional energy release at\nmoderate to small Thomson optical depths, which can readily give rise to the\nhard spectral tail. The position of the spectral peak is determined by the\ntemperature and Lorentz factor of the flow in the termalization zone, where the\ntotal number of photons carried by the jet is established. To reach\nthermalization, dissipation alone is not sufficient and photon generation\nrequires an efficient emission/absorption process in addition to scattering. We\nperform a systematic study of all relevant photon production mechanisms\nsearching for possible conditions in which thermalization can take place. We\nfind that a significant fraction of the available energy should be dissipated\nat intermediate radii, $\\sim 10^{10}$-- a few$\\times 10^{11}$ cm and the flow\nthere should be relatively slow: the bulk Lorentz factor could not exceed a few\ntens for all but the most luminous bursts with the highest $\\Epk$-s.

This requires,\nhowever, a non-thermal acceleration deep below the Thomson photosphere\ntransferring a significant fraction of the flow energy to relativistic\nelectrons with Lorentz factors between 10 and 100. Other processes require bulk\nflow Lorentz factors of order of a few for typical bursts.

The resulting radiative\nfeedback heats the environments of young protostars, and may thereby suppress\nfurther fragmentation and star formation. There is growing evidence that the\naccretion of material onto protostars is episodic rather than continuous; most\nof it happens in short bursts that last up to a few hundred years, whereas the\nintervals between these outbursts of accretion could be thousands of years. We\nhave developed a model to include the effects of episodic accretion in\nsimulations of star formation. Episodic accretion results in episodic radiative\nfeedback, which heats and temporarily stabilises the disc, suppressing the\ngrowth of gravitational instabilities. However, once an outburst has been\nterminated, the luminosity of the protostar is low, and the disc cools rapidly.\nProvided that there is enough time between successive outbursts, the disc may\nbecome gravitationally unstable and fragment. The model suggests that episodic\naccretion may allow disc fragmentation if (i) the time between successive\noutbursts is longer than the dynamical timescale for the growth of\ngravitational instabilities (a few kyr), and (ii) the quiescent accretion rate\nonto the protostar is sufficiently low (at most a few times 1e-7 Msun/yr). We\nalso find that after a few protostars form in the disc, their own episodic\naccretion events shorten the intervals between successive outbursts, and sup-\npress further fragmentation, thus limiting the number of objects forming in the\ndisc. We conclude that episodic accretion moderates the effect of radiative\nfeedback from young protostars on their environments, and, under certain\nconditions, allows the formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and\nplanetary-mass objects by fragmentation of protostellar discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

As an illustration of\nthe method we investigate massive vector (Proca) perturbations in the Kerr\nmetric, which do not appear to be separable in the standard Teukolsky\nformalism. Working in a perturbative scheme, we discuss two important effects\ninduced by rotation: a Zeeman-like shift of nonaxisymmetric quasinormal modes\nand bound states with different azimuthal number m, and the coupling between\naxial and polar modes with different multipolar index l. We explicitly compute\nthe perturbation equations up to second order in rotation, but in principle the\nmethod can be extended to any order. Working at first order in rotation we show\nthat polar and axial Proca modes can be computed by solving two decoupled sets\nof equations, and we derive a single master equation describing axial\nperturbations of spin s=0 and s=+-1. By extending the calculation to second\norder we can study the superradiant regime of Proca perturbations in a\nself-consistent way. For the first time we show that Proca fields around Kerr\nblack holes exhibit a superradiant instability, which is significantly stronger\nthan for massive scalar fields. Because of this instability, astrophysical\nobservations of spinning black holes provide the tightest upper limit on the\nmass of the photon: mv<4x10^-20 eV under our most conservative assumptions.\nSpin measurements for the largest black holes could reduce this bound to\nmv<10^-22 eV or lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 05:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Mass function types\nreflect the older stars and therefore the stellar mass distribution, while SFR\nfunction types arise from the young stars and hence the distribution of SFRs.\nOptical and near-infrared LFs are of the mass function type, and are well fit\nby a Schechter function (power law with an exponential cutoff at the bright\nend). In contrast, LFs of the SFR function type are of a different form, one\nthat cannot be adequately described by a Schechter function. We demonstrate\nthis difference by generating SFR distributions for mock samples of galaxies\ndrawn from a Schechter stellar mass distribution along with established\nempirical relations between the SFR and stellar mass. Compared with the\nSchechter function, SFR distributions have a shallower decline at the bright\nend, which can be traced to the large intrinsic scatter of SFRs at any given\nstellar mass. A superior description of SFR distributions is given by the\n\"Saunders\" function, which combines a power law with a Gaussian at the high\nend. We show that the Schechter-like appearance of UV and H alpha LFs, although\nthey are LFs of SFR function type, results when luminosities are not corrected\nfor dust, or when average statistical corrections are used because individual\nattenuation measurements are not available. We thus infer that the\nnon-Schechter form of the far-IR LFs is a true reflection of the underlying SFR\ndistribution, rather than the purported artifact of AGN contamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 20:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We investigate\nwhether the remnants resulting from collision-less N-body simulations of\nintermediate and minor mergers onto S0 galaxies evolve fulfilling global\nstructural relations observed between the bulges and disks of these galaxies.\nDifferent initial bulge-to-disk ratios of the primary S0 have been considered,\nas well as different satellite densities, mass ratios, and orbits of the\nencounter.

The electronic\nstructure near vortices can serve as a platform for phase-sensitive\nmeasurements to answer this question. By solving Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations\nfor LiFeAs, we calculate the energy-dependent local electronic structure near a\nvortex for different nodeless gap-structure possibilities. At low energies, the\nlocal density of states (LDOS) around a vortex is determined by the\nnormal-state electronic structure. However, at energies closer to the gap\nvalue, the LDOS can distinguish an anisotropic from a conventional isotropic\ns-wave gap.

In this study we show\nhow the interplay of heating, radiative cooling, and heat conduction in an\nexpanding magnetic structure can explain the observed constant cross section.\nWe employ a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (3D MHD) model of the\ncorona. The heating of the coronal plasma is the result of braiding of the\nmagnetic field lines through footpoint motions and subsequent dissipation of\nthe induced currents. From the model we synthesize the coronal emission, which\nis directly comparable to observations from, e.g., the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (AIA/SDO). We find that the\nsynthesized observation of a coronal loop seen in the 3D data cube does match\nactually observed loops in count rate and that the cross section is roughly\nconstant, as observed. The magnetic field in the loop is expanding and the\nplasma density is concentrated in this expanding loop; however, the temperature\nis not constant perpendicular to the plasma loop. The higher temperature in the\nupper outer parts of the loop is so high that this part of the loop is outside\nthe contribution function of the respective emission line(s). In effect, the\nupper part of the plasma loop is not bright and thus the loop actually seen in\ncoronal emission appears to have a constant width. From this we can conclude\nthat the underlying field-line-braiding heating mechanism provides the proper\nspatial and temporal distribution of the energy input into the corona --- at\nleast on the observable scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 20:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The\ndiscussion centers around the possible role of two level systems and structural\nglassy components for inducing the observed anomalies. We propose that the\norigin of glassy behavior is due to the dynamics of defects like dislocations\nformed in He-4. Within the developed framework of glassy components in a solid,\nwe give a summary of the results and predictions for the effects that cover the\nmechanical, thermodynamic, viscoelastic, and electro-elastic contributions of\nthe glassy response of solid He-4. Our proposed glass model for solid He-4 has\nseveral implications: (1) The anomalous properties of He-4 can be accounted for\nby allowing defects to freeze out at lowest temperatures. The dynamics of solid\nHe-4 is governed by glasslike (glassy) relaxation processes and the\ndistribution of relaxation times varies significantly between different\ntorsional oscillator, shear modulus, and dielectric function experiments. (2)\nAny defect freeze-out will be accompanied by thermodynamic signatures\nconsistent with entropy contributions from defects. It follows that such\nentropy contribution is much smaller than the required superfluid fraction, yet\nit is sufficient to account for excess entropy at lowest temperatures. (3) We\npredict a Cole-Cole type relation between the real and imaginary part of the\nresponse functions for rotational and planar shear that is occurring due to the\ndynamics of defects. Similar results apply for other response functions. (4)\nUsing the framework of glassy dynamics, we predict low-frequency yet to be\nmeasured electro-elastic features in defect rich He-4 crystals. These\npredictions allow one to directly test the ideas and very presence of glassy\ncontributions in He-4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 21:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}

The\nevolution of the nucleus energy with deformation is determined by the\nmacroscopic properties of the nucleus, and is also strongly influenced by the\nsingle-particle structure of the nucleus. The fission fragment distribution is\na direct consequence of the deformation path the nucleus has encountered, and\ntherefore is the most genuine experimental observation of the potential energy\nlandscape of the deforming nucleus. Very asymmetric fusion-fission reactions at\nenergy close to the Coulomb barrier, produce well-defined conditions of the\ncompound nucleus formation, where processes such as quasi-fission,\npre-equilibrium emission and incomplete fusion are negligible. In the same\ntime, the excitation energy is sufficient to reduce significantly structural\neffects, and mostly the macroscopic part of the potential is responsible for\nthe formation of the fission fragments. We use inverse kinematics combined with\nspectrometers to select and identify the fission fragments produced in\n$^{238}$U+$^{12}$C at a bombarding energy close to and well-above the Coulomb\nbarrier. For the first time, the isotopic yields are measured over the complete\natomic-number distribution, between Z=30 and Z=63. The experimental set-up also\nallows to identify transfer-induced reactions, which lead to low-energy fission\nwhere the nuclear shell structure shows a strong influence on the\nfission-fragment distributions. The resulting set of data gives the possibility\nto observe the fission fragment properties over a wide range of excitation\nenergy, and they reveal the vanishing of the shell effects in the potential\nenergy of the fissioning nucleus, as well as the influence of fission dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 22:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 11:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For\nthe remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni\nprofiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha. By day 147, after the plateau has ended,\nthe SN entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbidden\ntransitions of [O I], [O II], and [Ca II] over a weak continuum.

In the redshift range considered ($11 < z < 16$) the\naverage sphericity is $<s> = 0.3 \\pm 0.1$, and for more than 90% of halos the\ntriaxiality parameter is $T \\lesssim 0.4$, showing a clear preference for\noblateness over prolateness. Larger halos in the simulation tend to be both\nmore spherical and prolate: we find $s \\propto M_h^{\\alpha_s}$ and $T \\propto\nM_h^{\\alpha_T}$, with $\\alpha_s \\approx 0.128$ and $\\alpha_T= 0.276$ at z = 11.\nThe spin distributions of dark matter and gas are considerably different at\n$z=16$, with the baryons rotating slower than the dark matter. At lower\nredshift, instead, the spin distributions of dark matter and gas track each\nother almost perfectly, as a consequence of a longer time interval available\nfor momentum redistribution between the two components. The spin of both the\ngas and dark matter follows a lognormal distribution, with a mean value at z=16\nof $<\\lambda> =0.0184$, virtually independent of halo mass. This is in good\nagreement with previous studies. Using the results of two feedback models (MT1\nand MT2) by McKee & Tan (2008) and mapping our halo spin distribution into a\nPopIII IMF, we find that at high-$z$ the IMF closely tracks the spin lognormal\ndistribution. Depending on the feedback model, though, the distribution can be\ncentered at $\\approx 65 M_\\odot$ (MT1) or $\\approx 140 M_\\odot$ (MT2). At later\ntimes, model MT1 evolves into a bimodal distribution with a second prominent\npeak located at $35-40 M_\\odot$ as a result of the non-linear relation between\nrotation and halo mass. We conclude that the dark matter halo properties might\nbe a key factor shaping the IMF of the first stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 22:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 22:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-03"}

We focus on a symmetric model (SPED) that requires the two stubs\nof an edge to be of equal length. In this way, the stub at the other endpoint\nof an edge assures the viewer of the edge's existence.

Perhaps the oldest result in ergodic\ntheory is that of Poincar\\'e's Recurrence Principle which states: For any set\n$A \\in \\mathcal{F}$, the set of points $x$ of $A$ such that $T^nx$ is not in\nthe set $A$ for all $n > 0$ has zero measure.

It is valid at any\npoint in space, i.e. in the plane of the distribution (inside and outside) as\nwell as off-plane, thereby generalizing the results reported by Durand (1953)\nfor the circular disc. The three components of the gravitational acceleration\nare given. The mathematical demonstration proceeds from the \"incomplete version\nof Durand's formula\" for the potential (based on complete elliptic integrals).\nWe determine first the potential due to the circular sector (i.e. a pie-slice\nsheet), and then deduce that of the polar cell (from convenient radial scaling\nand subtraction).

Using 69\nlow-resolution GRB afterglow spectra, we conduct a study of the rest-frame\nequivalent width (EW) distribution of features with an average rest-frame EW\nlarger than 0.5 A. To compare an individual GRB with the sample, we develop EW\ndiagrams as a graphical tool, and we give a catalogue with diagrams for the 69\nspectra. We introduce a line strength parameter (LSP) that allows us to\nquantify the strength of the absorption features as compared to the sample by a\nsingle number. Using the distributions of EWs of single-species features, we\nderive the distribution of column densities by a curve of growth (CoG) fit. We\nfind correlations between the LSP and the extinction of the GRB, the UV\nbrightness of the host galaxies and the neutral hydrogen column density.\nHowever, we see no significant evolution of the LSP with the redshift. There is\na weak correlation between the ionisation of the absorbers and the energy of\nthe GRB, indicating that, either the GRB event is responsible for part of the\nionisation, or that galaxies with high-ionisation media produce more energetic\nGRBs. Spectral features in GRB spectra are, on average, 2.5 times stronger than\nthose seen in QSO intervening damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems and slightly\nmore ionised. In particular we find larger excess in the EW of CIV1549 relative\nto QSO DLAs, which could be related to an excess of Wolf-Rayet stars in the\nenvironments of GRBs. From the CoG fitting we obtain an average number of\ncomponents in the absorption features of GRBs of 6.00(-1.25,+1.00). The most\nextreme ionisation ratios in our sample are found for GRBs with low neutral\nhydrogen column density, which could be related to ionisation by the GRB\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 08:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-14"}

In this\nregime hydrodynamic interactions between particles arise from a superposition\nof potential dipolar singularities. We exploit this feature to derive the\nequations of motion for the particle positions and orientations. After showing\nthat all five planar Bravais lattices are stationary solutions of the equations\nof motion, we consider separately the case where the particles are passively\ndriven by an external force, and the situation where they are self-propelling.\nWe first demonstrate that phonon modes propagate in driven crystals, which are\nalways marginally stable. The spatial structure of the eigenmodes depend solely\non the symmetries of the lattices, and on the orientation of the driving force.\nFor active crystals, the stability of the particle positions and orientations\ndepends not only on the symmetry of the crystals but also on the perturbation\nwavelengths and on the crystal density. Unlike unconfined fluids, the stability\nof active crystals is independent of the nature of the propulsion mechanism at\nthe single particle level. The square and rectangular lattices are found to be\nlinearly unstable at short wavelengths provided the volume fraction of the\ncrystals is high enough. Differently, hexagonal, oblique, and face-centered\ncrystals are always unstable.

As\nbenefited from the better interpretability, neighborhood-based collaborative\nfiltering techniques, such as item-based collaborative filtering adopted by\nAmazon, have gained a great success in many practical recommender systems.\nHowever, the neighborhood-based collaborative filtering method suffers from the\nrating bound problem, i.e., the rating on a target item that this method\nestimates is bounded by the observed ratings of its all neighboring items.\nTherefore, it cannot accurately estimate the unobserved rating on a target\nitem, if its ground truth rating is actually higher (lower) than the highest\n(lowest) rating over all items in its neighborhood.

Recent experiments under such loading\nhave found this to be accompanied by a striking dip in the segmental relaxation\ntime. This can be explained by a minimal nonfactorable model combining\nflow-induced melting of a glass with the buildup of stress carried by strained\npolymers. Within this model, liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong\nflow that creates polymer-borne stress, slowing the deformation enough for the\nsegmental (or solvent) modes to then re-vitrify. Here we present new results\nfor the corresponding behavior under step-stress shear loading, to which very\nsimilar physics applies. To explain the unloading behavior in the extensional\ncase requires introduction of a crinkle factor describing a rapid loss of\nsegmental ordering. We discuss in more detail here the physics of this, which\nwe argue involves non-entropic contributions to the polymer stress, and which\nmight lead to some important differences between shear and elongation. We also\ndiscuss some fundamental and possibly testable issues concerning the physical\nmeaning of entropic elasticity in vitrified polymers.

If the shock hits only one agent initially and causes it to\nfail, this can induce a cascade of failures among neighoring agents. Several\ncritical constellations determine whether this cascade remains finite or\nreaches the size of the system, i.e. leads to systemic risk. We investigate the\ncritical parameters for such cascades in a simple model, where agents are\ncharacterized by an individual threshold \\theta_i determining their capacity to\nhandle a load \\alpha\\theta_i with 1-\\alpha being their safety margin. If agents\nfail, they redistribute their load equally to K neighboring agents in a regular\nnetwork. For three different threshold distributions P(\\theta), we derive\nanalytical results for the size of the cascade, X(t), which is regarded as a\nmeasure of systemic risk, and the time when it stops. We focus on two different\nregimes, (i) EEE, an external extreme event where the size of the shock is of\nthe order of the total capacity of the network, and (ii) RIE, a random internal\nevent where the size of the shock is of the order of the capacity of an agent.\nWe find that even for large extreme events that exceed the capacity of the\nnetwork finite cascades are still possible, if a power-law threshold\ndistribution is assumed. On the other hand, even small random fluctuations may\nlead to full cascades if critical conditions are met. Most importantly, we\ndemonstrate that the size of the \"big\" shock is not the problem, as the\nsystemic risk only varies slightly for changes of 10 to 50 percent of the\nexternal shock. Systemic risk depends much more on ingredients such as the\nnetwork topology, the safety margin and the threshold distribution, which gives\nhints on how to reduce systemic risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 13:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 07:25:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 14:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For example, the hemizgosity of the X may lead to a\nlower chromosomal effective population size compared to the autosomes\nsuggesting that the X might be more strongly affected by genetic drift.\nHowever, the X may also experience stronger positive selection than the\nautosomes because recessive beneficial mutations will be more visible to\nselection on the X where they will spend less time being masked by the\ndominant, less beneficial allele - a proposal known as the faster-X hypothesis.\nThus, empirical studies demonstrating increased genetic divergence on the X\nchromosome could be indicative of either adaptive or non-adaptive evolution. We\nmeasured gene expression in Drosophila species and in D. melanogaster inbred\nstrains for both embryos and adults. In the embryos we found that expression\ndivergence is on average more than 20% higher for genes on the X chromosome\nrelative to the autosomes, but in contrast, in the inbred strains gene\nexpression variation is significantly lower on the X chromosome.

This\nindicates that the overshooting mixing should be involved in investigating the\nsolar Li abundance problem. Observations of Li abundance of solar-twins show\nthat the sun is not very peculiar. The overshooting mixing should be also\ninvolved in investigating Li abundance in clusters. However, the fully\novershooting mixing with the length of $0.37H_P$ results in too much Li\ndepletion to fit the observation in the solar case. Therefore, using the\ndiffusive process to describe the overshooting is more suitable. The diffusive\novershooting approach requires the turbulent r.m.s. velocity in the\novershooting region to calculate the diffusion coefficient. Turbulent\nconvection models(TCMs), which are suggested by helioseimic investigation, can\nprovide the turbulent properties in the overshooting region. However, TCMs are\noften too complex to be applied in the calculations of the stellar evolution.\nIt is an easier way to use the asymptotic solution of TCMs. In this paper, I\nuse the asymptotic solution of Li & Yang's TCM, which results in agreements in\nboth solar sound speed and solar Li abundance, to investigate Li abundance in\nclusters(Hyades, Praesepe, NGC6633, NGC752, NGC3680 & M67).

Previous observations of the prototype FU\nOrionis have suggested that the wind lines and the photospheric lines are\nmodulated with periods of 14.54 and 3.54 days respectively (Herbig et al.\n2003). We have re-observed the system at higher spectral resolution, by\nmonitoring variations of optical line profiles over 21 nights in 2007 and have\nfound periods of 13.48 and 3.6 days in the wind and disc components consistent\nwith the above: this implies variability mechanisms that are stable over at\nleast a decade. In addition we have found: i) that the variations in the\nphotospheric absorption lines are confined to the blue wing of the line (around\n-9km/s): we tentatively ascribe this to an orbiting hotspot in the disc which\nis obscured by a disc warp during its receding phase. ii) The wind period is\nmanifested not only in blue-shifted Halpha absorption, but also in red-shifted\nemission of Halpha and Hbeta, as well as in blue-shifted absorption of Na I D,\nLi I and Fe II. iii) We find that the periodic modulation of blue-shifted\nHalpha absorption at around -100km/s, is phase lagged with respect to\nvariations in the other lines by ~1.8days. This is consistent with a picture in\nwhich variations at the wind base first affect chromospheric emission and then\nlow velocity blue-shifted absorption, followed - after a lag equal to the\npropagation time of disturbances across the wind's acceleration region - by a\nresponse in high velocity blue-shifted absorption. Such arguments constrain the\nsize of the acceleration region to ~10^12cm. We discuss possible mechanisms for\nperiodic variations within the innermost 0.1AU of the disc, including the\npossibility that these variations indicate the presence of an embedded hot\nJupiter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 13:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Sep 2012 14:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We find signs of\nrestructuring of the photospheric magnetic field during the flare close to the\npolarity inversion line (PIL) at the flaring site. At two locations in the\numbra we encounter strong fields (approx. 3 kG), as inferred from the Stokes I\nprofiles which, however, exhibit a low polarization signal.

The two-component atmosphere fits of the asymmetric Stokes\nprofiles result in line-of-sight velocity differences in the range of approx.\n12km/s to 14 km/s between the two components in the photosphere. Another\npossibility is that local atmospheric heating is causing the observed\nasymmetric Stokes V profile shape.

In the quantitative framework, an objective assigns a\nvalue to every play, and the goal of player 1 is to minimize the value of the\nobjective.

Consequently, a\ncomplete description of the Dirac state should include both the spin and\norbital (spatial) parts of the wavefunction. For the family of materials with a\nsingle Dirac cone, theories and experiments agree qualitatively, showing the\ntopological state has a chiral spin texture that changes handedness across the\nDirac point (DP), but they differ quantitatively on how the spin is polarized.\nLimited existing theoretical ideas predict chiral local orbital angular\nmomentum on the two sides of the DP.

Most existing\napproaches give conditions for perfect reliable broadcast (all correct nodes\ndeliver the authentic message and nothing else), but they require a highly\nconnected network. An approach giving only probabilistic guarantees (correct\nnodes deliver the authentic message with high probability) was recently\nproposed for loosely connected networks, such as grids and tori. Yet, the\nproposed solution requires a specific initialization (that includes global\nknowledge) of each node, which may be difficult or impossible to guarantee in\nself-organizing networks - for instance, a wireless sensor network, especially\nif they are prone to Byzantine failures. In this paper, we propose a new\nprotocol offering guarantees for loosely connected networks that does not\nrequire such global knowledge dependent initialization. In more details, we\ngive a methodology to determine whether a set of nodes will always deliver the\nauthentic message, in any execution. Then, we give conditions for perfect\nreliable broadcast in a torus network. Finally, we provide experimental\nevaluation for our solution, and determine the number of randomly distributed\nByzantine failures than can be tolerated, for a given correct broadcast\nprobability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2012 14:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-15"}
