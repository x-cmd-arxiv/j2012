Their spectral energy\ndistribution has a double-humped structure: the first hump lies in the X-ray\nregime, the second in the gamma-ray range. The X-ray emission is generally\nunderstood as synchrotron radiation by highly energetic leptons, the gamma-ray\nemission as Inverse Compton scattering of energetic leptons with ambient photon\nfields. The spectral evolution is influenced by the time-dependent spin-down of\nthe pulsar and the decrease of the magnetic field strength with time. Thus, the\npresent spectral appearance of a PWN depends on the age of the pulsar: while\nyoung PWNe are bright in X-rays and gamma-rays, the X-ray emission of evolved\nPWNe is suppressed. Hence, evolved pulsar wind nebulae may offer an explanation\nof the nature of some of the unidentified VHE (very high-energy, E > 100GeV)\ngamma-ray sources not yet associated with a counterpart at other wavelengths.\nThe purpose of this work is to develop a model which allows to calculate the\nexpected X-ray fluxes of unidentified VHE gamma-ray sources considered to be\nPWN candidates. Such an estimate may help to evaluate the prospects of\ndetecting the X-ray signal in deep observations with current X-ray\nobservatories in future studies. We present a time-dependent leptonic model\nwhich predicts the broad-band emission of a PWN according to the\ncharacteristics of its pulsar. For a sample of representative PWNe, the\nresulting model predictions in the X-ray and gamma-ray range are compared to\nobservations. The comparison shows that the energy flux of the X-ray emission\nof identified PWNe from different states of evolution can be roughly predicted\nby the model. This implies the possibility of an estimate of the non-thermal\nX-ray emission of unidentified VHE gamma-ray sources in case of an evolved PWN\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 16:19:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 08:08:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 09:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-16"}

Apart\nfrom low operational overhead, a highly attractive property of CHOKe is that it\ncan protect responsive TCP flows from unresponsive UDP flows. Particularly,\nprevious works have proven that CHOKe is able to bound both bandwidth share and\nbuffer share of (a possible aggregate) UDP traffic (flow) on a link. However,\nthese studies consider, and pertain only to, a steady state where the queue\nreaches equilibrium in the presence of many (long-lived) TCP flows and an\nunresponsive UDP flow of fixed arrival rate. If the steady state conditions are\nperturbed, particularly when UDP traffic rate changes over time, it is unclear\nwhether the protection property of CHOKe still holds. Indeed, it can be\nexamined, for example, that when UDP rate suddenly becomes 0 (i.e., flow\nstops), the unresponsive flow may assume close to full utilization in sub-RTT\nscales, potentially starving out the TCP flows. To explain this apparent\ndiscrepancy, this paper investigates CHOKe queue properties in a transient\nregime, which is the time period of transition between two steady states of the\nqueue, initiated when the rate of the unresponsive flow changes. Explicit\nexpressions that characterize flow throughputs in transient regimes are\nderived. These results provide additional understanding of CHOKe, and give some\nexplanation on its intriguing behavior in the transient regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 16:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

This paper uses Chen's\nrate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP) analysis to study what happens when\nsymbols must be transmitted in packets, as with a traditional hybrid ARQ\nsystem, and limited to relatively few (six or fewer) incremental transmissions.\n  Numerical optimizations find the series of progressively growing cumulative\nblock lengths that enable RCSP to approach capacity with the minimum possible\nlatency. RCSP analysis shows that five incremental transmissions are sufficient\nto achieve 92% of capacity with an average block length of fewer than 101\nsymbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB.\n  The RCSP analysis provides a decoding error trajectory that specifies the\ndecoding error rate for each cumulative block length. Though RCSP is an\nidealization, an example tail-biting convolutional code matches the RCSP\ndecoding error trajectory and achieves 91% of capacity with an average block\nlength of 102 symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB.

To cope\nwith the increasing demand for content, CPs deploy massively distributed\ninfrastructures. This poses new challenges for CPs as they have to dynamically\nmap end-users to appropriate servers, without being fully aware of network\nconditions within an ISP as well as the end-users network locations.\nFurthermore, ISPs struggle to cope with rapid traffic shifts caused by the\ndynamic server selection process of CPs.\n  In this paper, we argue that the challenges that CPs and ISPs face separately\ntoday can be turned into an opportunity. We show how they can jointly take\nadvantage of the deployed distributed infrastructures to improve their\noperation and end-user performance. We propose Content-aware Traffic\nEngineering (CaTE), which dynamically adapts the traffic demand for content\nhosted on CPs by utilizing ISP network information and end-user location during\nthe server selection process. As a result, CPs enhance their end-user to server\nmapping and improve end-user experience, thanks to the ability of\nnetwork-informed server selection to circumvent network bottlenecks. In\naddition, ISPs gain the ability to partially influence the traffic demands in\ntheir networks. Our results with operational data show improvements in path\nlength and delay between end-user and the assigned CP server, network wide\ntraffic reduction of up to 15%, and a decrease in ISP link utilization of up to\n40% when applying CaTE to traffic delivered by a small number of major CPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 17:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-08"}

We consider a model with a dilaton-like\ncoupling between a U(1) gauge field and a scalar inflaton. We show that this\ncoupling can result in observable non-gaussianity, even in the conventional\nregime where inflation is supported by a single scalar slowly rolling on a\nsmooth potential: the time dependent inflaton condensate leads to amplification\nof the large-scale gauge field fluctuations, which can feed-back into the\nscalar/tensor cosmological perturbations. In the squeezed limit, the resulting\nbispectrum is close to the local one, but it shows a sizable and characteristic\nquadrupolar dependence on the angle between the shorter and the larger modes in\nthe correlation. Observable non-gaussianity is obtained in a regime where\nperturbation theory is under control.

In its simplest form, the\nplanted partition model is a model for random graphs on $n$ nodes with two\nequal-sized clusters, with an between-class edge probability of $q$ and a\nwithin-class edge probability of $p$. Although most of the literature on this\nmodel has focused on the case of increasing degrees (ie.\\ $pn, qn \\to \\infty$\nas $n \\to \\infty$), the sparse case $p, q = O(1/n)$ is interesting both from a\nmathematical and an applied point of view.\n  A striking conjecture of Decelle, Krzkala, Moore and Zdeborov\\'a based on\ndeep, non-rigorous ideas from statistical physics gave a precise prediction for\nthe algorithmic threshold of clustering in the sparse planted partition model.\nIn particular, if $p = a/n$ and $q = b/n$, then Decelle et al.\\ conjectured\nthat it is possible to cluster in a way correlated with the true partition if\n$(a - b)^2 > 2(a + b)$, and impossible if $(a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)$. By\ncomparison, the best-known rigorous result is that of Coja-Oghlan, who showed\nthat clustering is possible if $(a - b)^2 > C (a + b)$ for some sufficiently\nlarge $C$.\n  We prove half of their prediction, showing that it is indeed impossible to\ncluster if $(a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)$. Furthermore we show that it is impossible\neven to estimate the model parameters from the graph when $(a - b)^2 < 2(a +\nb)$; on the other hand, we provide a simple and efficient algorithm for\nestimating $a$ and $b$ when $(a - b)^2 > 2(a + b)$. Following Decelle et al,\nour work establishes a rigorous connection between the clustering problem,\nspin-glass models on the Bethe lattice and the so called reconstruction\nproblem. This connection points to fascinating applications and open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 19:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 02:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 19:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 00:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-23"}

Here, we show that a\nset of tunneling problems may be investigated with no ancillary qubits and a\ncost of one single-qubit operator per time step for the potential evolution. We\nshow that physically interesting simulations of tunneling using 2 qubits (i.e.\non 4 lattice point grids) may be performed with 40 single and two-qubit gates.\nApproximately 70 to 140 gates are needed to see interesting tunneling dynamics\nin three-qubit (8 lattice point) simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 21:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

Methods: This study was based on 12CO(1-0) fully sampled observations of a\nregion of ~0.45{\\deg} in size around the star WR 55 and the nebula RCW 78\nobtained with the 4-m NANTEN telescope, radio continuum archival data at 1.4\nand 4.85 GHz, obtained from SGPS and PMNRAO Southern Radio Survey,\nrespectively, and available infrared MIPSGAL images at 24 microns. Results: A\nmolecular gas component in the velocity range from ~ -58 to -45 km s-1,\ncompatible with the velocity of the ionized gas, was found to be associated\nwith the optical nebula. Adopting a distance of ~ 5 kpc, the mass of this\nmolecular component is about 3.4 x 10^4 Msun. The analysis of the molecular\ndata revealed the presence of a velocity gradient, in agreement with the Halpha\nline. New radiocontinuum flux density determinations confirm the thermal nature\nof RCW 78. This indicates that the ionized gas in RCW 78 arises from\nphotoionization of the molecular gas component in the velocity range from -58\nkm s-1 to -45 km s-1. A molecular concentration at a velocity of -56.1 km s-1\n(identified as C1) is very likely associated with the star HD 117797 and with a\ncollection of candidate YSOs, lying at a distance of 3.9 kpc, while the rest of\nthe molecular gas at velocities between -56 and -46 km s-1 constitute an\nincomplete ring-like structure which expands around WR 55 at a velocity of\nabout ~ 5 km s-1.

The data allows for evaluation of neutron production process\nimplemented in theoretical simulation codes. It also helps exploring the\nreasons for some disagreement between calculation results and shielding\nbenchmark data taken at high energy accelerator facilities, since it is\nevaluated separately from neutron transport. The experiment was carried out\nusing a 120 GeV proton beam of 3E5 protons/spill. Since the spill duration was\n4 seconds, proton-induced events were counted pulse by pulse. The intensity was\nmaintained using diffusers and collimators installed in the beam line to MTBF.\nThe protons hit a copper block target the size of which is 5cm x 5cm x 60 cm\nlong. The neutrons produced in the target were measured using NE213 liquid\nscintillator detectors, placed about 5.5 m away from the target at 30^{\\circ}\nand 5 m 90^{\\circ} with respect to the proton beam axis. The neutron energy was\ndetermined by time-of-flight technique using timing difference between the\nNE213 and a plastic scintillator located just before the target.

Altogether we analyze 2.5 transits, 3\neclipses, and a 58-hour near-continuous observation designed to detect the\nplanet's thermal phase curve. The results of our analysis are: (1) A mean\ntransit depth of 1.484% +/- 0.035%, consistent with previous measurements and\nshowing no evidence of variability in transit depth at the 3% level. (2) A mean\neclipse depth of 0.332% +/- 0.026%, somewhat higher than that previously\nreported for this system; this new value brings observations into better\nagreement with models. The dayside flux shows no evidence of variability at the\n12% level.

The most interesting is that the microwave\nQPP is consisting of millisecond timescale superfine structures. Each microwave\nQPP pulse is made up of clusters of millisecond spike bursts or narrow band\ntype III bursts. There are three different frequency drift rates: global\nfrequency drift rate of microwave QPP pulse group, frequency drift rate of\nmicrowave QPP pulse, and frequency drift rate of individual millisecond spikes\nor type III bursts. The physical analysis indicates that the energetic\nelectrons accelerating from a large-scale highly dynamic magnetic reconnecting\ncurrent sheet above the flaring loop propagate downwards, impact on the flaring\nplasma loop, and produce HXR bursts. The tearing-mode (TM) oscillations in the\ncurrent sheet modulate HXR emission and generate HXR QPP; the energetic\nelectrons propagating downwards produce Langmuir turbulence and plasma waves,\nresult in plasma emission. The modulation of TM oscillation on the plasma\nemission in the current-carrying plasma loop may generate microwave QPP. The TM\ninstability produces magnetic islands in the loop. Each X-point will be a small\nreconnection site and accelerate the ambient electrons. These accelerated\nelectrons impact on the ambient plasma and trigger the millisecond spike\nclusters or the group of type III bursts.

The presence of the strong RRC is the definitive\nevidence that the plasma is recombining (overionized). As a possible origin of\nthe overionization, an interaction between the ejecta and dense circumstellar\nmatter is proposed; the highly ionized gas was made at the initial phase of the\nSNR evolution in dense regions, and subsequent rapid adiabatic expansion caused\nsudden cooling of the electrons. The analysis on the full X-ray band spectrum\nof IC 443, which is newly presented in this paper, provides a consistent\npicture with this scenario.

The manner in which dust populations evolve with the\nexcitation and the physical conditions is a first step in the comprehension of\nthe evolution of inter- stellar dust. Within the framework of the Evolution of\ninterstellar dust Herschel key program, we have acquired PACS and SPIRE spec-\ntrophotometric observations of various photodissociation regions, to\ncharacterise this evolution. The aim of this paper is to trace the evolution of\ndust grains in the Orion Bar photodissociation region. We use Herschel/PACS (70\nand 160 mic) and SPIRE (250, 350 and 500 mic) together with Spitzer/IRAC\nobservations to map the spatial distribution of the dust populations across the\nBar. Brightness profiles are modelled using the DustEM model coupled with a\nradiative transfer code. Thanks to Herschel, we are able to probe finely the\ndust emission of the densest parts of the Orion Bar with a resolution from 5.6\"\nto 35.1\". These new observations allow us to infer the temperature of the\nbiggest grains at different positions in the Bar, which reveals a gradient from\n\\sim 80 K to 40 K coupled with an increase of the spectral emissivity index\nfrom the ionization front to the densest regions. Combining Spitzer/IRAC\nobservations, which are sensitive to the dust emission from the surface, with\nHerschel maps, we have been able to measure the Orion Bar emission from 3.6 to\n500 mic. We find a stratification in the different dust components which can be\nre- produced quantitatively by a simple radiative transfer model without dust\nevolution. However including dust evolution is needed to explain the brightness\nin each band. PAH abundance variations, or a combination of PAH abundance\nvariations with an emissivity enhancement of the biggest grains due to\ncoagulation give good results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 08:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In our model, structural inhomogeneities in the jet\nmagnetic field create cancellation of polarization along the line of sight.\nInternal Faraday rotation, which increases like wavelength squared, acts to\nalign the polarization from the far and near sides of the jet, leading to\nincreased polarization at longer wavelengths. Structural inhomogeneities of the\nright type are naturally produced in helical magnetic fields and will also\nappear in randomly tangled magnetic fields. We explore both alternatives and\nfind that, for random fields, the length scale for tangling cannot be too small\na fraction of the jet diameter and still be consistent with the relatively high\nlevels of fractional polarization observed in these features.

Its solution is\nof central importance in covariance estimation, particularly in the recent\nhigh-dimensional data environment where enforcing the positive-definiteness\nconstraint could be computationally expensive. We provide a survey of the\nprogress made in modeling covariance matrices from two relatively complementary\nperspectives: (1) generalized linear models (GLM) or parsimony and use of\ncovariates in low dimensions, and (2) regularization or sparsity for\nhigh-dimensional data. An emerging, unifying and powerful trend in both\nperspectives is that of reducing a covariance estimation problem to that of\nestimating a sequence of regression problems. We point out several instances of\nthe regression-based formulation. A notable case is in sparse estimation of a\nprecision matrix or a Gaussian graphical model leading to the fast graphical\nLASSO algorithm. Some advantages and limitations of the regression-based\nCholesky decomposition relative to the classical spectral (eigenvalue) and\nvariance-correlation decompositions are highlighted. The former provides an\nunconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization, and\nguarantees the positive-definiteness of the estimated covariance matrix. It\nreduces the unintuitive task of covariance estimation to that of modeling a\nsequence of regressions at the cost of imposing an a priori order among the\nvariables. Elementwise regularization of the sample covariance matrix such as\nbanding, tapering and thresholding has desirable asymptotic properties and the\nsparse estimated covariance matrix is positive definite with probability\ntending to one for large samples and dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 11:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-09"}

With the help of recently released\nWISE satellite data, we look for signs of enhanced mid-infrared scattering\n(coreshine), an indication of growth of the dust grains, and examine the star\nformation activity associated with the cold clumps. The mapped clouds have\ndistances ranging from ~100pc to several kiloparsecs and cover a range of sizes\nand masses from cores of less than 10 solar masses to clouds with masses in\nexcess of 10000 solar mass. Most fields contain some filamentary structures and\nin about half of the cases a filament or a few filaments dominate the\nmorphology. In one case out of ten, the clouds show a cometary shape or have\nsharp boundaries indicative of compression by an external force. The width of\nthe filaments is typically ~0.2-0.3pc. However, there is significant variation\nfrom 0.1pc to 1pc and the estimates are sensitive to the methods used and the\nvery definition of a filament. Enhanced mid-infrared scattering, coreshine, was\ndetected in four clouds with six additional tentative detections. The cloud\nLDN183 is included in our sample and remains the best example of this\nphenomenon. About half of the fields are associated with active star formation\nas indicated by the presence of mid-infrared point sources.

We find that the standard deviation for the\nmean cross correlation deviate from that of simulations at the 99.9% level.\nAdditionally, a comparison between the CMB temperature extrema and the extremum\npoints of the Faraday rotation is also performed, showing a general overlap\nbetween the two. Also we find that the CMB Cold Spot is located at an area of\nstrong negative cross correlation, meaning that it may be explained by a\ngalactic origin. Further, we investigate nearby supernova remnants in the\ngalaxy, traced by the galactic radio loops. These super nova remnants are\nlocated at high and low galactic latitude, and thus well outside the galactic\nplane. We find some correlation between the Faraday Rotation and the CMB\ntemperature, at select radio loops. This indicate, that the galactic\nforegrounds may affect the CMB, at high galactic latitudes\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 14:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-27"}

The macroscopic static friction coefficient, which\ncorresponds to the onset of bulk sliding of the object, decreases as pressure\nor system length increases. This decrease results from precursor slips before\nthe onset of bulk sliding, and is consistent with the results of certain\nprevious experiments. The mechanisms for these behaviours are clarified.

We prove that the Kuzmin property for\nNewtonian gravity still holds, i.e., that the density distribution of separable\npotentials is fully determined once the density profile along the minor axis is\nassigned. At variance with the Newtonian case, the fact that a positive density\nalong the minor axis leads to a positive density everywhere remains unproven.\nWe also prove that (i) all regular separable models in MOND have a vanishing\ndensity at the origin, so that they would correspond to centrally dark-matter\ndominated systems in Newtonian gravity; (ii) triaxial separable potentials\nregular at large radii and associated with finite total mass leads to density\ndistributions that at large radii are not spherical and decline as ln(r)/r^5;\n(iii) when the triaxial potentials admit a genuine Frobenius expansion with\nexponent 0<epsilon<1, the density distributions become spherical at large\nradii, with the profile ln(r)/r^(3+2epsilon).

The complete EVE spectral range covers the free-bound continua of\nH I (Lyman continuum), He I, and He II, with recombination edges at 91.2, 50.4,\nand 22.8 nm, respectively. By fitting the wavelength ranges blue-ward of each\nrecombination edge with an exponential function, lightcurves of each of the\nintegrated continua were generated over the course of the flare, as well as\nemission from the free-free continuum (6.5-37 nm). The He II 30.4 nm and\nLyman-alpha 121.6 nm lines, and soft X-ray (0.1-0.8 nm) emission from GOES are\nalso included for comparison. Each free-bound continuum was found to have a\nrapid rise phase at the flare onset similar to that seen in the 25-50 keV\nlightcurves from RHESSI, suggesting that they were formed by recombination with\nfree electrons in the chromosphere. However, the free-free emission exhibited a\nslower rise phase seen also in the soft X-ray emission from GOES, implying a\npredominantly coronal origin. By integrating over the entire flare the total\nenergy emitted via each process was determined. We find that the flare energy\nin the EVE spectral range amounts to at most a few per cent of the total flare\nenergy, but EVE gives us a first comprehensive look at these diagnostically\nimportant continuum components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 15:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Optical follow-up spectroscopic observations show\nthat in addition to cataclysmic variables (CVs) and very active stellar\ncoronae, massive stars (colliding wind binaries, quiescent high-mass X-ray\nbinaries and Gamma-Cas analogs) account for a sizable fraction of the Galactic\nhard X-ray sources at medium flux (Fx > 10^-13 erg/s/cm^2). Cross-correlations\nof the 2XMM-DR3 catalogue with 2MASS and GLIMPSE confirm the presence above 2\nkeV of a large population of coronally active binaries, probably of the BY Dra\nand RS CVn types, in addition to many distant and absorbed massive stars.

In this\nwork, which utilizes data from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard\nHinode, the broadened line profiles were observed to be co-spatial with the two\nHXR footpoints as observed by RHESSI. By plotting the derived nonthermal\nvelocity for each pixel within the Fe XV and Fe XVI rasters against its\ncorresponding Doppler velocity a strong correlation (|r| > 0.59) was found\nbetween the two parameters for one of the footpoints. This suggested that the\nexcess broadening at these temperatures is due to a superposition of flows\n(turbulence), presumably as a result of chromospheric evaporation due to\nnonthermal electrons. Also presented are diagnostics of electron densities\nusing five pairs of density-sensitive line ratios. Density maps derived using\nthe Mg XII and Si X line pairs showed no appreciable increase in electron\ndensity at the footpoints, while the Fe XII, Fe XIII, and Fe XIV line pairs\nrevealed densities approaching 10^(11.5) cm^(-3). Using this information, the\nnonthermal velocities derived from the widths of the two Fe XIV lines were\nplotted against their corresponding density values derived from their ratio.\nThis showed that pixels with large nonthermal velocities were associated with\npixels of moderately higher densities. This suggests that nonthermal broadening\nat these temperatures may have been due to enhanced densities at the\nfootpoints, although estimates of the amount of opacity broadening and pressure\nbroadening appeared to be negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 15:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-09"}

With the help of density functional theory, we\ncalculate the relaxed geometries and vibrational modes of extended molecules\neach consisting of one or two PDT molecules connecting two gold nanoclusters.\nWe formulate a perturbative theory of inelastic tunneling through molecules\nbridging metal contacts in terms of elastic transmission amplitudes, and use\nthis theory to calculate the inelastic tunneling spectra of the gold-PDT-gold\nextended molecules. We consider PDT molecules with both trans and gauche\nconformations bound to the gold clusters at top, bridge and hollow bonding\nsites. Comparing our results with the experimental data of Hihath et al. [Nano\nLett. 8, 1673 (2008)], we identify the most frequently realized conformation in\nthe experiment as that of trans molecules top-site bonded to both electrodes.\nWe find the switching from the 42 meV vibrational mode to the 46 meV mode\nobserved in the experiment to be due to the transition of trans molecules from\nmixed top-bridge to pure top-site bonding geometries. Our results also indicate\nthat gauche molecular conformations and hollow site bonding did not contribute\nsignificantly to the experimental inelastic tunneling spectra. For pairs of PDT\nmolecules connecting the gold electrodes in parallel we find total elastic\nconductances close to twice those of single molecules bridging the contacts\nwith similar bonding conformations and small splittings of the vibrational mode\nenergies for the modes that are the most sensitive to the molecule-electrode\nbonding geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 05:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

The blended learning model is realized\nas a combination of face to face education and e-learning. The intelligent\nlearning environments consist of two applications named CTutor, ITest. In\naddition to standard e-learning tools, students can use CTutor to resolve C\nprogramming exercises. CTutor is a problem-solving environment, which diagnoses\nstudents' knowledge level but also gives feedbacks and tips to help them to\nunderstand the course subject, overcome their misconceptions and reinforce\nlearnt concepts. ITest provides an assessment environment in which students can\ntake quizzes that were prepared according to their learning levels. The\nrealized model was used for two terms in the \"C Programming\" course given at\nAfyon Kocatepe University. A survey was conducted at the end of the course to\nfind out to what extent the students were accepting the blended learning model\nsupported with @KU-UZEM and to discover students' attitude towards intelligent\nlearning environments. Additionally, an experiment formed with an experimental\ngroup who took an active part in the realized model and a control group who\nonly took the face to face education was performed during the first term of the\ncourse. According to the results, students were satisfied with intelligent\nlearning environments and the realized learning model. Furthermore, the use of\nintelligent learning environments improved the students' knowledge about C\nprogramming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 11:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-14"}

Malware is potentially low to high risk and\ncan cause systems to function incorrectly, steal data and even crash. Malware\nmay be executable or system library files in the form of viruses, worms,\nTrojans, all aimed at breaching the security of the system and compromising\nuser privacy. Typically, anti-virus software is based on a signature definition\nsystem which keeps updating from the internet and thus keeping track of known\nviruses. While this may be sufficient for home-users, a security risk from a\nnew virus could threaten an entire enterprise network. This paper proposes a\nnew and more sophisticated antivirus engine that can not only scan files, but\nalso build knowledge and detect files as potential viruses. This is done by\nextracting system API calls made by various normal and harmful executable, and\nusing machine learning algorithms to classify and hence, rank files on a scale\nof security risk. While such a system is processor heavy, it is very effective\nwhen used centrally to protect an enterprise network which maybe more prone to\nsuch threats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 14:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-15"}
