The UV/optical\nflux from the nucleus was found to vary dramatically over the monitoring\nperiod, with a similar pattern of variation in each of the observed UV/optical\nbands (spanning 1900 - 5500 {\\AA}). In particular, the luminosity of NGC 4395\nin the 1900 {\\AA} band changed by more than a factor of eight over the\nmonitoring period. The fractional variability was smaller in the UV/optical\nbands than that seen in the X-rays, with the X-ray/optical ratio increasing\nwith increasing flux. Pseudo-instantaneous flux measurements in the X-ray and\neach UV/optical band were well correlated, with cross correlation coefficients\nof >0.7, significant at 99.9 per cent confidence. Archival Swift observations\nfrom 2006 sample the intra-day X-ray/optical variability on NGC 4395. These\narchival data show a very strong correlation between the X-ray and b bands,\nwith a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.84 (significant at >99 per cent\nconfidence). The peak in the cross correlation function is marginally resolved\nand asymmetric, suggesting that X-rays lead the b band, but by 1 hour. In\nresponse to recent (August 2011) very high X-ray flux levels from NGC4395 we\ntriggered Swift ToO observations, which sample the intra-hour X-ray/UV\nvariability. These observations indicate, albeit with large uncertainties, a\nlag of the 1900 {\\AA} band behind the X-ray flux of ~400 s. The tight\ncorrelation between the X-ray and UV/optical lightcurves, together with the\nconstraints we place on lag time-scale are consistent with the UV/optical\nvariability of NGC 4395 being primarily due to reprocessing of X-ray photons by\nthe accretion disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 16:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Using the\nassociation of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with the death of massive stars\nand their ultra-luminous nature, the CSFH can be probed to higher redshifts\nthan current conventional methods. Unfortunately, no consensus has been reached\non the manner in which the LGRB rate (LGRBR) traces the CSFH, leaving many of\nthe questions mentioned mostly unexplored by this method. Observations by the\nGRB NIR detector (GROND) over the past 4 years have, for the first time,\nacquired highly complete LGRB samples. Driven by these completeness levels and\nnew evidence of LGRBs also occurring in more massive and metal rich galaxies\nthan previously thought, the possible biases of the LGRBR-CSFH connection are\ninvestigated over a large range of galaxy properties. The CSFH is modelled\nusing empirical fits to the galaxy mass function and galaxy star formation\nrates. Biasing the CSFH by metallicity cuts, mass range boundaries, and other\nunknown redshift dependencies, a LGRBR is generated and compared to the highly\ncomplete GROND sample. It is found that there is no strong preference for a\nmetallicity cut or fixed galaxy mass boundaries and that there are no unknown\nredshift effects, in contrast to previous work which suggest values of\nZ/Z_sun~0.1-0.3. From the best-fit models, we predict that ~1.2% of the LGRB\nburst sample exists above z=6. The linear relationship between the LGRBR and\nthe CSFH suggested by our results implies that redshift biases present in\nprevious LGRB samples significantly affect the inferred dependencies of LGRBs\non their host galaxy properties. Such biases can lead to, e.g., an\ninterpretation of metallicity limitations and evolving LGRB luminosity\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 17:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It contributes to the line of work initiated\nby Procaccia and Tennenholtz [EC09] on approximate mechanism design without\nmoney. We explore and argue for an intuitive and simple rule of complexity\nO(nk),a so-called proportionality mechanism. The mechanism works in k\nconsecutive rounds,each time choosing a random player at whose position to\nplace the next facility; each time the probabilities of players to be picked\nare distributed proportionally to their distances to the current set of the\nfacilities. Lu et al. [EC10] showed that the proportionality rule is incentive\ncompatible for k=1,2, but fails to be so for k>2.\n  We tweak the model slightly such that for any k, the proportionality\nmechanism becomes incentive compatible. In the new model we allow the\ngovernment to be bureaucratic, i.e., to have the power of to force each player\nto choose from only a specific set of available facilities. In the\nproportionality mechanism, we force every player that receives a facility at\nhis reported location to connect to exactly that facility. We extend the\nproportionality mechanism to a more general setting with a private network of\nfacilities already present in the metric space and show that it is truthful as\nwell.\n  We further show that for any fixed k, the proportionality rule achieves in\nexpectation a constant approximation guarantee to the optimal solution; namely\nat most a ratio of 4k. On the other hand, we show a lower bound of ln\nk(1+o(1)), and we suspect the truth to be closer to this lower bound. Thus, our\nwork is the first among those on incentive compatible facility location that\ntreats effectively (with a constant factor of approximation) the general case\nof an arbitrary number of facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 18:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 10:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-10"}

The\nworst, same experimental systems dealing with the same pairs of mRNA and miRNA\ncan provide ambiguous evidences about which is the actual mechanism of\ntranslation repression observed in the experiment. We start with reviewing the\ncurrent knowledge of various mechanisms of miRNA action and suggest that\nmathematical modeling can help resolving some of the controversial\ninterpretations. We describe three simple mathematical models of miRNA\ntranslation that can be used as tools in interpreting the experimental data on\nthe dynamics of protein synthesis. The most complex model developed by us\nincludes all known mechanisms of miRNA action. It allowed us to study possible\ndynamical patterns corresponding to different miRNA-mediated mechanisms of\ntranslation repression and to suggest concrete recipes on determining the\ndominant mechanism of miRNA action in the form of kinetic signatures. Using\ncomputational experiments and systematizing existing evidences from the\nliterature, we justify a hypothesis about co-existence of distinct\nmiRNA-mediated mechanisms of translation repression.

Image sequences of the same region reveal weakly\nemitting upward propagating disturbances in both hot and cool emission with\napparent speeds of 50-150km/s. Spectroscopic observations indicate that these\npropagating disturbances produce a weak emission component in the blue wing at\ncommensurate speed, but that they contribute only a few percent to the\n(ensemble) emission line profile in a single spatio-temporal resolution\nelement. Subsequent analysis of imaging data shows material \"draining\" slowly\n(~10km/s) out of the corona, but only in the cooler passbands. We interpret the\ndraining as the return-flow of coronal material at the end of the complex\nchromosphere-corona mass cycle. Further, we suggest that the efficient\nradiative cooling of the draining material produces a significant contribution\nto the red wing of cool emission lines that is ultimately responsible for their\nsystematic red-shift as derived from a single Gaussian fit when compared to\nthose formed in hotter (conductively dominated) domains.

To quantify the uncertainty arising from\nrandom rate constants, it is necessary to investigate how one can simulate such\na biochemical system. To do this, we will take the Gillespie's stochastic\nsimulation algorithm for simulating the evolution of the state of a chemical\nsystem, and study a modification of the algorithm that incorporates the random\nrate constants. In addition to simulating the waiting time of each reaction\nstep, the modified algorithm also involves simulating the random fluctuation of\nthe rate constant at each reaction time. We consider the modified algorithm in\na general framework, then specialize it to two contrasting physical models, one\nin which the fluctuations occur on a much faster time scale than the reaction\nstep, and the other in which the fluctuations occur much more slowly. The\nlatter case was applied to the single enzyme reaction system, using in part the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm to enact the given distribution on the random\nrate constants. The modified algorithm is shown to produce simulation outputs\nthat are corroborated by the experimental results.

Gravitino mediation\narises from minimally uplifting SUSY anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to Minkowski\nspace, generating soft masses proportional to the gravitino mass. Kahler\nmediation arises when visible sector fields have linear couplings to SUSY\nbreaking in the Kahler potential, generating soft masses proportional to beta\nfunction coefficients.

We do this using a set of XMM-Newton\nreference spectra of local galaxies for which we have accurate NH information,\nas described in Brightman & Nandra. The technique uses two rest-frame hardness\nratios which are optimised for this task, which we designate HR1 (2-4/1-2 keV)\nand HR2 (4-16/2-4 keV). The selection method exploits the fact that while\nobscured AGN appear hard in HR2 due to absorption of the intrinsic source flux\nbelow ~4 keV, they appear soft in HR1 due to excess emission originating from\nscattered source light, thermal emission, or host galaxy emission. Such\nemission is ubiquitous in low redshift samples. The technique offers a very\nsimple and straight forward way of estimating the fraction of obscured AGN in\nsamples with relatively low signal-to-noise ratio in the X-ray band. We apply\nthis technique to a moderate redshift (z~1) sample of AGN from the Chandra Deep\nField North, finding that 61% of this sample has NH> 10^23 cm^-2. A clear and\nrobust conclusion from our analysis, is that in deep surveys the vast majority\nof sources do not show hardness ratios consistent with a simple absorbed\npower-law. The ubiquity of complex spectra in turn shows that simple hardness\nratio analysis will not yield reliable obscuration estimates, justifying the\nmore complex colour-colour analysis described in this paper.

This review article highlights recent advances in the\ncondensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe\nthat this quest may soon bear fruit.

Numerous\nproposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as\ntopological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals, and\nmany others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects\nMajorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes\nof measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling,\nJosephson effects, and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable\nproperties of condensed matter Majorana fermions--the non-Abelian exchange\nstatistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum\ncomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 21:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We contribute to this endeavor by deriving\nanalytical formulas concerning a geometric correction for the ICME speed and\narrival time for the technique introduced by Davies et al.

This model assumes that a\ncircle propagates outward, along a plane specified by a position angle (e.g.\nthe ecliptic), with constant angular half width (lambda). This is an extension\nto earlier, more simple models: Fixed-Phi-Fitting (lambda = 0 degree) and\nHarmonic Mean Fitting (lambda = 90 degree). This approach has the advantage\nthat it is possible to assess clearly, in contrast to previous models, if a\nparticular location in the heliosphere, such as a planet or spacecraft, might\nbe expected to be hit by the ICME front. Our correction formulas are especially\nsignificant for glancing hits, where small differences in the direction greatly\ninfluence the expected speeds (up to 100-200 km/s) and arrival times (up to two\ndays later than the apex). For very wide ICMEs (2 lambda > 120 degree), the\ngeometric correction becomes very similar to the one derived by M\\\"ostl et al.\n(2011, ApJ, 741, id. 34) for the Harmonic Mean model.

In this paper, we consider these effects using the Zel'dovich\napproximation and a novel approach to 2nd order perturbation theory. The second\norder term of the Zel'dovich power spectrum is built from convolutions of the\nlinear power spectrum with polynomial kernels in Fourier space, suggesting that\nthe corresponding term of the the Zel'dovich correlation function can be\nwritten as a sum of quadratic products of a broader class of correlation\nfunctions, expressed through simple spherical Bessel transforms of the linear\npower spectrum.

Finally,\nwe highlight the advantages of writing the nonlinear expansion in configuration\nspace, as this calculation is easily extended to redshift space, and the higher\norder terms are mathematically simpler than their Fourier counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 22:13:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 13:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-24"}

The concept of verifiable\ncomputation enables a weak client to outsource difficult computations to a\npowerful, but untrusted, server. Protocols for verifiable computation aim to\nprovide the client with a guarantee that the server performed the requested\ncomputations correctly, without requiring the client to perform the\ncomputations herself. By design, these protocols impose a minimal computational\nburden on the client. However, existing protocols require the server to perform\na large amount of extra bookkeeping in order to enable a client to easily\nverify the results. Verifiable computation has thus remained a theoretical\ncuriosity, and protocols for it have not been implemented in real cloud\ncomputing systems.\n  Our goal is to leverage GPUs to reduce the server-side slowdown for\nverifiable computation. To this end, we identify abundant data parallelism in a\nstate-of-the-art general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation,\noriginally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, and recently extended by\nCormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler. We implement this protocol on the GPU,\nobtaining 40-120x server-side speedups relative to a state-of-the-art\nsequential implementation. For benchmark problems, our implementation reduces\nthe slowdown of the server to factors of 100-500x relative to the original\ncomputations requested by the client. Furthermore, we reduce the already small\nruntime of the client by 100x. Similarly, we obtain 20-50x server-side and\nclient-side speedups for related protocols targeted at specific streaming\nproblems. We believe our results demonstrate the immediate practicality of\nusing GPUs for verifiable computation, and more generally that protocols for\nverifiable computation have become sufficiently mature to deploy in real cloud\ncomputing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 04:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 05:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 04:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-23"}

The\nmass normalization of the clusters as measured by weak lensing shear is >~25%\nhigher than that measured using SZ and X-ray methods, a difference much larger\nthan the stated measurement errors in the analyses. We constrain the\nmass-richness relation of the MaxBCG galaxy cluster catalog by measuring the\ngravitational lensing magnification of type I quasars in the background of the\nclusters. The magnification is determined using the quasars' variability and\nthe correlation between quasars' variability amplitude and intrinsic\nluminosity. The mass-richness relation determined through magnification is in\nagreement with that measured using shear, confirming that the lensing strength\nof the clusters implies a high mass normalization, and that the discrepancy\nwith other methods is not due to a shear-related systematic measurement error.\nWe study the dependence of the measured mass normalization on the cluster halo\norientation. As expected, line-of-sight clusters yield a higher normalization;\nhowever, this minority of haloes does not significantly bias the average\nmass-richness relation of the catalog.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 08:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In close WR+O binaries, X-rays likely originate in\ncolliding stellar wind (CSW) shocks driven by the massive winds of the binary\ncomponents.

The calculation\nrequires the value of a multiplicative correction factor to the apparent\ncoefficient of viscosity calculated by substitution of terminal velocity of the\nfalling ball in Stokes formula. This correction factor, the so-called viscosity\nratio, a measure of deviation from Stokes limit, arises from non-vanishing\nvalues of the Reynolds number and the ball/tube radius ratio. The method, valid\nover a very wide range of Reynolds number, is based on the recognition of a\nrelationship between two measures of wall effect, the more widely investigated\nvelocity ratio, defined as the ratio of terminal velocity in a confined medium\nto that in a boundless medium and viscosity ratio. The calculation uses two\nrecently published correlation formulae based on extensive experimental results\non terminal velocity of a falling ball. The first formula relates velocity\nratio to Reynolds number and ball-tube radius ratio. The second formula gives\nan expression of the ratio of the drag force actually sensed by the ball\nfalling in an infinite medium to that in the Stokes limit as a function of\nReynolds number alone. It is shown that appropriate use of this correction\nfactor extends the utility of the technique of falling ball viscometry beyond\nthe very low Reynolds number 'creepy flow' regime, to which its application is\npresently restricted. Issues related to accuracy are examined by use of our own\nmeasurements of the terminal velocity of a falling ball in a narrow tube and\nthat of published literature reports, on liquids of known viscosity\ncoefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 12:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 14:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

The paper reveals the inherent relationship of the\nunambiguous measurement range (UMR), the outlier probability, the MSE\nperformance with the frequency pattern in MFI system, and then provides the\ncorresponding criterion for choosing the frequency pattern. We point out that\nthe theoretical rigorous UMR of MFI deduced in the literature is usually\noptimistic for practical application and derive a more practical expression .\nIt is found that the least-square (LS) estimator of MFI has a distinguished\n\"double threshold effect\". Distinct difference is observed for the MSE in\nmoderate and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region (denoted by MMSE and HMSE\nrespectively) and the second threshold effect occurs during the rapid\ntransition from MMSE to HMSE with increasing SNR. The closed-form expressions\nfor the MMSE, HMSE and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) are further derived, with HMSE\ncoinciding with CRB. Since the HMSE is insensitive to frequency pattern, we\nfocus on MMSE minimization by proper frequency optimization. We show that a\nprime-based frequency interval can be exploited for the purpose of both outlier\nsuppression and UMR extension and design a special optimal rearrangement for\nany set of frequency interval, in the sense of MMSE minimization. An extremely\nsimple frequency design method is finally developed.

We focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 bursts\nwith XRT error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. Three of\nthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upper\nlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on the\nX-ray flux.

However, little is known\nabout what lies ahead in the crucial sub-second regime where humans become\nunable to respond or intervene sufficiently quickly. Here we analyze a set of\n18,520 ultrafast black swan events that we have uncovered in stock-price\nmovements between 2006 and 2011.

For this purpose, we derive equations of\nmotion for steady-state spherically symmetric flow of phantom energy onto the\nstringy magnetically charged black hole. It is found that phantom energy\naccreting onto black hole decreases its mass. Further, the location of critical\npoints of accretion is explored, which yields mass to charge ratio. This ratio\nimplies that accretion process cannot transform a black hole into an extremal\nblack hole or a naked singularity, hence cosmic censorship hypothesis remains\nvalid here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2012 08:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
