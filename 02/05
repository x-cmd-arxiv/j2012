In this model, we assume that the mole fraction\nx of the liquid-like micro regions tends to zero as the temperature T of the\nliquid is decreased and extrapolated to a temperature Tg*, which we assume to\nbe below but close to the lowest glass transition temperature Tg attainable\nwith the slowest possible cooling rate for the liquid. Without referring to any\nspecific microscopic nature of the solid-like and liquid-like micro regions, we\nalso assume that near Tg, the molar enthalpy of the solid-like micro regions is\nlower than that of the liquid-like micro regions. We then show that the\ntemperature dependence of x is directly related to that of the molar excess\nentropy. Close to Tg, we assume that an activated motion of the solid-like\nmicro regions controls the viscosity and that this activated motion is a\ncollective motion involving practically all of the solid-like micro-regions so\nthat the molar activation free energy for the activated motion is proportional\nto the mole fraction, 1-x, of the solid-like micro regions. The temperature\ndependence of the viscosity is thus connected to that of the molar excess\nentropy through the temperature dependence of the mole fraction x.

Thus, an observed social network provides a noisy signal about\nthe latent underlying \"social space:\" the way in which individuals are similar\nor dissimilar. Many research questions frequently addressed via social network\nanalysis are in reality questions about this social space, raising the question\nof inverting the process: Given a social network, how accurately can we\nreconstruct the social structure of similarities and dissimilarities?\n  We begin to address this problem formally. Observed social networks are\nusually multiplex, in the sense that they reflect (dis)similarities in several\ndifferent \"categories,\" such as geographical proximity, kinship, or similarity\nof professions/hobbies. We assume that each such category is characterized by a\nlatent metric capturing (dis)similarities in this category. Each category gives\nrise to a separate social network: a random graph parameterized by this metric.\nFor a concrete model, we consider Kleinberg's small world model and some\nvariations thereof. The observed social network is the unlabeled union of these\ngraphs, i.e., the presence or absence of edges can be observed, but not their\norigins.

We simulate the\nelectron-cyclotron maser instability in a very low-beta plasma. The model used\ntakes into account the radiation escape from the source region and the particle\nflow through this region. We developed a kinetic code to simulate the time\nevolution of an electron distribution in a radio emission source. The model\nincludes the terms describing the particle injection to and escape from the\nemission source region. The spatial escape of the emission from the source is\ntaken into account by using a finite amplification time. The unstable electron\ndistribution of the horseshoe type is considered. A number of simulations were\nperformed for different parameter sets typical of the magnetospheres of planets\nand ultracool dwarfs. The generated emission (corresponding to the fundamental\nextraordinary mode) has a frequency close to the electron cyclotron frequency\nand propagates across the magnetic field. Shortly after the onset of a\nsimulation, the electron distribution reaches a quasi-stationary state. If the\nemission source region is relatively small, the resulting electron distribution\nis similar to that of the injected electrons; the emission intensity is low. In\nlarger sources, the electron distribution may become nearly flat due to the\nwave-particle interaction, while the conversion efficiency of the particle\nenergy flux into waves reaches 10-20%. We found good agreement of our model\nwith the in situ observations in the source regions of auroral radio emissions\nof the Earth and Saturn.

NLFFF\nextrapolation needs a considerable effort to be devoted for its numerical\nrealization. In this paper we present a new implementation of the\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-relaxation method for NLFFF extrapolation. The\nmagneto-frictional approach which is introduced for speeding the relaxation of\nthe MHD system is novelly realized by the spacetime conservation-element and\nsolution-element (CESE) scheme. A magnetic field splitting method is used to\nfurther improve the computational accuracy. The bottom boundary condition is\nprescribed by changing the transverse field incrementally to match the\nmagnetogram, and all other artificial boundaries of the computational box are\nsimply fixed. We examine the code by two types of NLFFF benchmark tests, the\nLow & Lou (1990) semi-analytic force-free solutions and a more realistic\nsolar-like case constructed by van Ballegooijen et al. (2007). The results show\nthat our implementation are successful and versatile for extrapolations of\neither the relatively simple cases or the rather complex cases which need\nsignificant rebuilding of the magnetic topology, e.g., a flux rope.

Applying the macroscopic force (of order 1) on the system, and\nthus on any of its components, one normally gets changes on the macroscale\nitself and simultaneously small, of the order $\\frac{1}{N}$, changes of the\nmicrocomponents. In the systems, considered below, with the strong Coulomb\nrepulsion between the particles, however, one can observe the influence of such\nforce on the equilibrium state only on a scale, much smaller that the standard\nmicroscale. Otherwise speaking, the information about the macroforce is not\navailable neither on the macrocale nor on the standard microscale, but only on\na finer scale. If this phenomenon does not depend on the continuity properties\nof the applied force, then the mere existence of the equilibrium depends\nessentially on the continuity properties of the external force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2012 14:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-07"}

Remarkably, much of this size evolution appears to take place\nin a short (1.8 Gyr) time span between z=2.2 and z=1.3, which poses a serious\nchallenge to hierarchical galaxy formation models where mergers occurring on a\nsimilar timescale are the main mechanism for galaxy growth. We compute the\nmerger-driven redshift evolution of stellar mass Mstar\\propto(1+z)^aM,\nhalf-mass radius Re\\propto(1+z)^aR and velocity-dispersion\nsigma0\\propto(1+z)^asigma predicted by concordance Lambda cold dark matter for\na typical massive ETG in the redshift range z=1.3-2.2.

It follows that the predicted z=2.2\nprogenitors of z=1.3 ETGs are significantly less compact (on average a factor\nof 2 larger Re at given Mstar) than the quiescent galaxies observed at z>2.\nFurthermore, we find that the scatter introduced in the size-mass correlation\nby the predicted merger-driven growth is difficult to reconcile with the\ntightness of the observed scaling law.
