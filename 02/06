We define LAEs as those\nLy$\\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent widths\n(Ly$\\alpha$ EW$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\\AA, the typical threshold in\nnarrow-band searches. Ly$\\alpha$ emitting galaxies with Ly$\\alpha$\nEW$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-LAEs. As a result of an individual SED fitting\nfor each object, we find that the studied sample of LAEs contains galaxies with\nages mostly below 100Myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, SFRs, and\nstellar masses. The heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen in\nthe morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. In\nthis way, we find that LAEs at 2.0$\\lesssim$z$\\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,\nand do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. Furthermore,\nthe main difference between LAEs and non-LAEs is their dust attenuation,\nbecause LAEs are not as dusty as non-LAEs. On the FIR side, four galaxies of\nthe sample (two LAEs and two non-LAEs) have PACS-FIR counterparts. Their total\nIR luminosity place all of them in the ULIRG regime and are all dusty objects,\nwith A$_{1200}$$\\gtrsim$4mag. This is an indication from direct FIR\nmeasurements that dust and Ly$\\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. This\npopulation of red and dusty LAEs is not seen at z$\\sim$0.3, suggesting an\nevolution with redshift of the IR nature of galaxies selected via their\nLy$\\alpha$ emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2012 20:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-14"}

A possible scheme for long-distance\nentanglement sharing and quantum communication exploits networks whose nodes\nshare Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. In Perseguers et al. [Phys. Rev. A\n78, 062324 (2008)] the authors put forward an important isomorphism between\nstoring quantum information in a dimension $D$ and transmission of quantum\ninformation in a $D+1$-dimensional network. We show that it is possible to\nobtain long-distance entanglement in a noisy two-dimensional (2D) network, even\nwhen taking into account that encoding and decoding of a state is exposed to an\nerror. For 3D networks we propose a simple encoding and decoding scheme based\nsolely on syndrome measurements on 2D Kitaev topological quantum memory. Our\nprocedure constitutes an alternative scheme of state injection that can be used\nfor universal quantum computation on 2D Kitaev code. It is shown that the\nencoding scheme is equivalent to teleporting the state, from a specific node\ninto a whole two-dimensional network, through some virtual EPR pair existing\nwithin the rest of network qubits. We present an analytic lower bound on\nfidelity of the encoding and decoding procedure, using as our main tool a\nmodified metric on space-time lattice, deviating from a taxicab metric at the\nfirst and the last time slices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2012 22:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 09:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2013 19:51:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2014 19:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 08:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-29"}

Most of the existing\nmethods use some information about the spatial distribution of components,\ne.g., closeness to an external template, independence of components etc., in\norder to separate them. In this paper we propose a method where one puts\nconditions on the spectra only. The advantages of our method are: 1) it is\ninternal: the maps of the components are constructed as combinations of data in\ndifferent energy bins, 2) the components may be correlated among each other, 3)\nthe method is semi-blind: in many cases, it is sufficient to assume a\nfunctional form of the spectra and determine the parameters from a maximization\nof a likelihood function. As an example, we derive the CMB map and the\nforeground maps for seven yeas of WMAP data. In an Appendix, we present a\ngeneralization of the method, where one can also add a number of external\ntemplates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 02:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-07"}

With this goal, we try to join on the results by Kubo on statistical\nmechanical systems close to equilibrium, i.e. whose unperturbed state can be\ndescribed by a canonical ensemble, the theory of dispersion relations, and the\nresponse theory recently developed by Ruelle for non-equilibrium systems\nequipped with an invariant SRB measure. Our derivations highlight the strong\nlink between causality and the possibility of connecting unambiguously\nfluctuation and response, both at linear and nonlinear level. We first show in\na rather general setting how the formalism of the Ruelle response theory can be\nused to derive in a novel way Kramers-Kronig relations connecting the real and\nimaginary part of the linear and nonlinear response to external perturbations.\nWe then provide a formal extension at each order of nonlinearity of the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) for general systems possessing a smooth\ninvariant measure. Finally, we focus on the physically relevant case of systems\nclose to equilibrium, for which we present explicit fluctuation-dissipation\nrelations linking the susceptibility describing the $n^{th}$ order response of\nthe system with the expectation value of suitably defined correlations of $n+1$\nobservables taken in the equilibrium ensemble. While the FDT has an especially\ncompact structure in the linear case, in the nonlinear case joining the\nstatistical properties of the fluctuations of the system to its response to\nexternal perturbations requires linear changes of variables, simple algebraic\nsums and multiplications, and a multiple convolution integral. These\noperations, albeit cumbersome, can be easily implemented numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 09:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It is found that the acceleration electric field and potential in the\nannular gap and core gap are huge enough in the several tens of neutron star\nradii. The pulsed emission of radio, X-ray, gamma-ray and TeV are mainly\ngenerated from the emission of primary particles or secondary particles with\ndifferent emission mechanisms in the nearly similar region of the annular gap\nlocated in the only one magnetic pole, which leads to the nearly\n\"phase-aligned\" multi-wavelength light curves.

The new pulsar, confirmed with the Green Bank\nTelescope, has a spin period of 2.38 ms, is relatively nearby (d <~ 2 kpc), and\nis in a 1.48 day orbit around a low mass companion, probably a He-type white\ndwarf. Pulsed gamma-ray emission was detected in the data recorded by the Fermi\nLAT. The gamma-ray light curve and spectral properties are typical of other\ngamma-ray millisecond pulsars seen with Fermi. X-ray observations of the pulsar\nwith Suzaku and the Swift/XRT yielded no detection. At 1.4 GHz we observe\nstrong flux density variations because of interstellar diffractive\nscintillation, however a sharp peak can be observed at this frequency during\nbright scintillation states. At 327 MHz the pulsar is detected with a much\nhigher signal-to-noise ratio and its flux density is far more steady. However,\nat that frequency the Arecibo instrumentation cannot yet fully resolve the\npulse profile. Despite that, our pulse time-of-arrival measurements have a\npost-fit residual rms of 2 \\mus. This and the expected stability of this system\nhas made PSR J2043+1711 one of the first new Fermi-selected millisecond pulsars\nto be added to pulsar gravitational wave timing arrays. It has also allowed a\nsignificant measurement of relativistic delays in the times of arrival of the\npulses due to the curvature of space-time near the companion, but not yet with\nenough precision to derive useful masses for the pulsar and the companion. A\nmass for the pulsar between 1.7 and 2.0 solar masses can be derived if a\nstandard millisecond pulsar formation model is assumed.

Provided that optical light in the rest\nframe traces the stellar mass of galaxies, the universal relation demonstrates\nthat the stellar mass was built up in galaxies over their cosmic histories in a\nsimilar manner on average irrelevant to galaxy mass. The small offset in each\nstellar mass bin from the universal relation shows weak size evolution at a\ngiven mass. There is a moderate increase of 30-50 percent for R_50 and R_90 for\nless massive galaxies (Mstar < 10^10 Msun) from z~3 to z~1, while the sizes\nremains unchanged or slightly decrease towards z~0.3. For massive galaxies\n(Mstar > 10^11 Msun), the evolution is ~70-80 % increase in R_90 from z~3 to\nz~0.3, though that in R_50 is weaker. The evolution of compactness factor,\nR_50/R_90, which becomes smaller at lower redshift, is suggestive of minor\nmerging effect in the outer envelope of massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 13:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Assuming that (i) u and v are two sparse vectors separated by an\nangle thetha, and (ii) the sensing matrix Phi satisfies RIP, this paper is\naimed at analytically characterizing the achievable angles between Phi*u and\nPhi*v. Motivated by geometric interpretations of RIP and with the aid of the\nwell-known law of cosines, we propose a plane geometry based formulation for\nthe study of the considered problem. It is shown that all the RIP-induced\nnorm/distance constraints on Phi*u and Phi*v can be jointly depicted via a\nsimple geometric diagram in the two-dimensional plane. This allows for a joint\nanalysis of all the considered algebraic constraints from a geometric\nperspective. By conducting plane geometry analyses based on the constructed\ndiagram, closed-form formulae for the maximal and minimal achievable angles are\nderived. Computer simulations confirm that the proposed solution is tighter\nthan an existing algebraic-based estimate derived using the polarization\nidentity. The obtained results are used to derive a tighter restricted isometry\nconstant of structured sensing matrices of a certain kind, to wit, those in the\nform of a product of an orthogonal projection matrix and a random sensing\nmatrix. Follow-up applications to three CS problems, namely, compressed-domain\ninterference cancellation, RIP-based analysis of the orthogonal matching\npursuit algorithm, and the study of democratic nature of random sensing\nmatrices are investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 14:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The resulting networks are\nthen often considered static. More often than not, the aggregation time window\nis dictated by the availability of data, and the effects of its length on the\nresulting networks are rarely considered. Here, we address this question by\nstudying the structural features of networks emerging from aggregating\nempirical data over different time intervals, focussing on networks derived\nfrom time-stamped, anonymized mobile telephone call records. Our results show\nthat short aggregation intervals yield networks where strong links associated\nwith dense clusters dominate; the seeds of such clusters or communities become\nalready visible for intervals of around one week. The degree and weight\ndistributions are seen to become stationary around a few days and a few weeks,\nrespectively. An aggregation interval of around 30 days results in the stablest\nsimilar networks when consecutive windows are compared. For longer intervals,\nthe effects of weak or random links become increasingly stronger, and the\naverage degree of the network keeps growing even for intervals up to 180 days.\nThe placement of the time window is also seen to affect the outcome: for short\nwindows, different behavioural patterns play a role during weekends and\nweekdays, and for longer windows it is seen that networks aggregated during\nholiday periods are significantly different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 14:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-29"}

We develop a\ncross-layer solution, based on hybrid ARQ transmission with incremental\nredundancy. We provide a scheme that combines power control, flow control, and\nscheduling in order to maximize a global utility function, subject to the\nstability of the data queues, an average power constraint, and a constraint on\nthe privacy outage probability. Our scheme is based on the assumption that each\nnode has an estimate of its uplink channel gain at each block, while only the\ndistribution of the cross channel gains is available. We prove that our scheme\nachieves a utility, arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility given\nthe available channel state information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 15:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-07"}

They are usually\nattributed in the literature to periodical phenomena in the source (e.g.,\nprecession). In this work, we use VLBI data of the radio-jet in the quasar S5\n0836+710 and hypothesize that the ridge-line of helical jets like this\ncorresponds to a pressure maximum in the jet and assume that the helically\ntwisted pressure maximum is the result of a helical wave pattern. For our\nstudy, we use observations of the jet in S5 0836+710 at different frequencies\nand epochs. The results show that the structures observed are physical and not\ngenerated artificially by the observing arrays. Our hypothesis that the\nobserved intensity ridge-line can correspond to a helically twisted pressure\nmaximum is confirmed by our observational tests. This interpretation allows us\nto explain jet misalignment between parsec and kiloparsec scales when the\nviewing angle is small, and also brings us to the conclusion that\nhigh-frequency observations may show only a small region of the jet flow\nconcentrated around the maximum pressure ridge-line observed at low\nfrequencies. Our work provides a potential explanation for the apparent\ntransversal superluminal speeds observed in several extragalactic jets by means\nof transversal shift of an apparent core position with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 15:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-20"}

When the microwave is applied only on the QD and in\nthe linear-response regime, the main peaks in the thermoelectric figure of\nmerit and the thermopower are found to decrease, with the emergence of a set of\nphoton-induced peaks. Under this condition the microwave field can not generate\nheat current or electrical bias voltage. Surprisingly, when the microwave field\nis applied only to one (bright) lead and not to the other (dark) lead or the\nQD, heat flows mostly from the dark to the bright lead, almost irrespectively\nto the direction of the thermal gradient. We attribute this effect to\nmicrowave-induced opening of additional transport channels below the Fermi\nenergy. The microwave field can change both the magnitude and the sign of the\nelectrical bias voltage induced by the temperature gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2012 15:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}
