Contour advection simulations provide a good\nmodel of the phenomenon by tracking the evolution of one or more contours or\nisolines of a trace substance to a high level of precision. The most accurate\nmethod of validating an advected contour is to divide the tracer concentration\ninto discrete ranges and perform a maximum likelihood classification, a method\nthat we term, \"isoline retrieval.\" Conditional probabilities generated as a\nresult provide excellent error characterization.\n  In this study, a water vapour isoline of 0.001 mass-mixing-ratio is advected\nover five days in the upper troposphere and compared with high-resolution AMSU\n(Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) satellite retrievals. The goal is to find\nthe same fine-scale, chaotic mixing in the isoline retrievals as seen in the\nadvection simulations. Some of the filaments generated by the simulations show\nup in the conditional probabilities as areas of reduced probability. By\nrescaling the probabilities, the filaments may be revealed in the isoline\nretrievals proper with little effect on the overall accuracy. Limitations\nimposed by the specific context, i.e. water-vapour retrieved with AMSU in the\nupper troposphere, are discussed. Nonetheless, isoline retrieval is shown to be\na highly effective technique for atmospheric sounding, showing good agreement\nwith both ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts)\nassimilation data and radiosonde measurements.\n  Software for isoline retrieval can be found at: http://isoret.sourceforge.net\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 16:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-28"}

The\nsimplest way to carry out such goodness-of-fit tests, especially in a\nmultivariate setting, is to use a parametric bootstrap. Although very easy to\nimplement, the parametric bootstrap can become very computationally expensive\nas the sample size, the number of parameters, or the dimension of the data\nincrease. An alternative resampling technique based on a fast weighted\nbootstrap is proposed in this paper, and is studied both theoretically and\nempirically. The outcome of this work is a generic and computationally\nefficient multiplier goodness-of-fit procedure that can be used as a\nlarge-sample alternative to the parametric bootstrap. In order to approximately\ndetermine how large the sample size needs to be for the parametric and weighted\nbootstraps to have roughly equivalent powers, extensive Monte Carlo experiments\nare carried out in dimension one, two and three, and for models containing up\nto nine parameters.

In natural\nlanguage processing applications, words are naturally modeled by K-ary discrete\ndistributions, where K is determined by the vocabulary size and can easily be\nin the hundreds of thousands. The conventional approach to training RBMs on\nword observations is limited because it requires sampling the states of K-way\nsoftmax visible units during block Gibbs updates, an operation that takes time\nlinear in K. In this work, we address this issue by employing a more general\nclass of Markov chain Monte Carlo operators on the visible units, yielding\nupdates with computational complexity independent of K. We demonstrate the\nsuccess of our approach by training RBMs on hundreds of millions of word\nn-grams using larger vocabularies than previously feasible and using the\nlearned features to improve performance on chunking and sentiment\nclassification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 20:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 12:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}

The excitonic evolution is\ndescribed by a Monte-Carlo wave function approach which allows for a unified\ndescription of the quantum (ballistic) and classical (diffusive) propagation of\nan exciton on a lattice in different parameter regimes. The transition between\nthe ballistic and diffusive regime is controlled by static and dynamic\ndisorder. As an example, the model is applied to three cyanine dye\nJ-aggregates: TC, TDBC, and U3. Each of the molecule-specific structure and\nexcitation parameters are estimated using time-dependent density functional\ntheory. The exciton diffusion coefficients are calculated and analyzed for\ndifferent degrees of film disorder and are correlated to the physical\nproperties and the structural arrangement of molecules in the aggregates.\nFurther, exciton transport is anisotropic and dependent on the initial exciton\nenergy. The upper-bound estimation of the exciton diffusion length in the TDBC\nthin-film J-aggregate is of the order of hundreds of nanometers, which is in\ngood qualitative agreement with the diffusion length estimated from\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2012 01:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-20"}

This significant warm-start bias which may be attributed to the limited\nexposure of a business in its first steps may mask analysis performed on\nratings and reputational ramifications. Therefore, we study techniques to\nidentify and correct for this bias. Further, we perform a case study to explore\nthe effect of a Groupon deal on the merchant's subsequent ratings and show both\nthat previous research has overestimated Groupon's effect to merchants'\nreputation and that average ratings anticorrelate with the number of reviews\nreceived.

It is based on the OPE\nanalysis of the four-point correlation function of stress-tensor multiplets,\nwhich has been recently constructed up to six loops. The Konishi operator gives\nthe leading contribution to the singlet SU(4) channel of this OPE. Its\nanomalous dimension is the coefficient of the leading single logarithmic\nsingularity of the logarithm of the correlation function in the double\nshort-distance limit, in which the operator positions coincide pairwise. We\nregularize the logarithm of the correlation function in this singular limit by\na version of dimensional regularization. At any loop level, the resulting\nsingularity is a simple pole whose residue is determined by a finite two-point\nintegral with one loop less. This drastically simplifies the five-loop\ncalculation of the Konishi anomalous dimension by reducing it to a set of known\nfour-loop two-point integrals and two unknown integrals which we evaluate\nanalytically.

The\ndetected transitions are modeled as arising from 2 different components: a\nmoderate excitation (ME) component close to the galaxy systemic velocity, and a\nhigh excitation (HE) component that is blueshifted by ~80 km s^{-1}.

A homogeneous 5D\nenergy-momentum manifold produces naturally the uncertainty principle, and from\nwhich we obtained the 5D metric operator, together with the 5D vector and\nmass-less spinor fields. A naturally coupled product of these two fields is\nalso a solution of the 5D metric operator. Thus the coupling constant is\nidentified as the unit charge. The charged mass-less spinor is coined as the\ne-trino. Hence the vector field generated by such e-trinos is derived, such\nthat in the 4x1 Hilbert space this vector potential can be identified as the\nMaxwell monopole potential. Through gauge invariance the concept of charge per\nunit mass is introduced, which then leads to the mapping of the 5D\nenergy-momentum into that of SU(2)xL and SU(3)xL via the time-shift projection\nP0 and the conformal space projection P1, respectively.

But the demon always fell short of doing so because of the\nimposed restrictive condition that reads, the demon needs to do \"work\".\nTherefore, you can always preserve the second law by default. Here, we\nencounter the supernatural demon (without the above restriction) right at the\nmelting point, and unambiguously expose why the demon is still doomed to fail\nfor all time- and space-scales. This means that the second law of\nthermodynamics can never be violated. We develop an analytic strategy (based on\nNewton's third law) to properly analyze the entropy in a chemical system with\nrespect to forward and reverse trajectories. We also explain the\nphysico-chemical processes that are responsible at very short timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2012 12:47:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 01:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-13"}
