Second, for stable\ntheories \"lots of indiscernibility exists\" a \"too good indiscernible existence\ntheorem\" saying, e.g. that if the type tp (d_beta ; {d_beta : beta < alpha}) is\nincreasing for alpha < kappa = cf(kappa) and kappa > 2^{|T|} then <d_alpha :\nalpha in S> is indiscernible for some stationary S subseteq kappa. Third, for\nstable T,a model is kappa-saturated iff it is aleph_epsilon-saturated and every\ninfinite indiscernible set (of elements) of cardinality < kappa can be\nincreased. We prove here an analog. Fourth, for p in S(M), the number of\nultrafilters on the outside definable subsets of M extending p has an absolute\nbound 2^{|T|} . Restricting ourselves to one phi(x, y), the number is finite,\nwith an absolute found (well depending on T and phi).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2012 22:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-28"}

Nearly five thousand\nperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental\nfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total\ncount up to over 2,300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to\nhigher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging\nof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis\nwhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of\nphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the new\ncandidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T_0, and orbital period, P) are\ntabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius\n(Rp/R*), reduced semi-major axis (d/R*), and impact parameter (b). The largest\nfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% for\ncandidates smaller than 2Re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2Re) and\nthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbits\nversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). The gains are larger than\nexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (Quarter 1--\nQuarter 5) to sixteen months (Quarter 1 -- Quarter 6). This demonstrates the\nbenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. The fraction of\nall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and the\npaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The\nprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new\ncatalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone are\nforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 08:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The notion has been recently extended\nto the identity-based setting by Bellare et al. (Eurocrypt'12). We provide one\nmore step in this direction, by considering the notion of hierarchical\nidentity-based (lossy) trapdoor functions (HIB-TDFs). Hierarchical\nidentity-based cryptography has proved very useful both for practical\napplications and to establish theoretical relations with other cryptographic\nprimitives.\n  The notion of security for IB-TDFs put forward by Bellare et al. easily\nextends to the hierarchical scenario, but an (H)IB-TDF secure in this sense is\nnot known to generically imply other related primitives with security against\nadaptive-id adversaries, not even IND-ID-CPA secure encryption. Our first\ncontribution is to define a new security property for (H)IB-TDFs. We show that\nfunctions satisfying this property imply secure cryptographic primitives in the\nadaptive identity-based setting: these include encryption schemes with semantic\nsecurity under chosen-plaintext attacks, deterministic encryption schemes, and\n(non-adaptive) hedged encryption schemes that maintain some security when\nmessages are encrypted using randomness of poor quality.\n  Then, we describe the first pairing-based HIB-TDF realization. Our HIB-TDF\nconstruction is based on techniques that differ from those of Bellare et al. in\nthat it uses a hierarchical predicate encryption scheme as a key ingredient.\nThe resulting HIB-TDF is proved to satisfy the new security definition, against\neither selective or, for hierarchies of constant depth, adaptive adversaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 08:43:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2012 08:10:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2012 11:59:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 07:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}

By constructing a Two-Stage Unit Information Prior in\nthe endogenous variable model, we are able to efficiently combine established\nmethods for addressing model uncertainty in regression models with the classic\ntechnique of 2SLS. To assess the validity of instruments in the 2SBMA context,\nwe develop Bayesian tests of the identification restriction that are based on\nmodel averaged posterior predictive p-values. A simulation study showed that\n2SBMA has the ability to recover structure in both the instrument and covariate\nset, and substantially improves the sharpness of resulting coefficient\nestimates in comparison to 2SLS using the full specification in an automatic\nfashion. Due to the increased parsimony of the 2SBMA estimate, the Bayesian\nSargan test had a power of 50 percent in detecting a violation of the\nexogeneity assumption, while the method based on 2SLS using the full\nspecification had negligible power.

The study is related to recent experiments at the free\nelectron laser at DESY in which photoelectron spectra from mass-selected,\ncore-shell ionized metal clusters have been recorded. Relaxed and unrelaxed\nbinding energies as well as Kohn-Sham orbital energies are calculated in\nPerdew-Zunger self-interaction-corrected exchange-only local spin-density\napproximation for valence and 2p core electrons in Na clusters up to 58 atoms.\nThe relaxed binding energies follow approximately the metal-sphere behavior.\nThe same behavior is seen in the experiment for sufficiently big clusters,\nindicating perfect screening and that the relaxation energy due to screening\ngoes to the photoelectron. Instead, calculating the kinetic energy of the\nphotoelectrons using unrelaxed binding energies or Kohn-Sham orbital energies\nyields wrong results for core-shell electrons. The screening {\\em dynamics} are\ninvestigated using time-dependent density functional theory. It is shown that\nscreening occurs on two time scales, a core-shell-dependent inner-atomic and an\ninter-atomic valence electron time scale. In the case of Na 2p ionization the\nremaining electrons in the 2p shell screen within tens of attoseconds while the\nscreening due to cluster valence electrons occurs within several hundreds of\nattoseconds. The screening time-scales may be compared to the photon energy and\ncluster size-dependent escape times of the photoelectron in order to estimate\nwhether the photoelectron is capable of picking up the relaxation energy or\nwhether the residual system is left in an excited state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 10:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 19:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

It has been extensively observed with ground based\ntelescopes and within the WISH Guaranteed Time Herschel Key Program. We present\nnew observations of the C18O 3-2 and the HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} lines towards NGC\n7129 FIRS 2. Combining these observations with Herschel data and modeling their\nemissions, we constrain the C18O and HDO abundance profiles across the\nprotostellar envelope. In particular, we derive the abundance of C18O and HDO\nin the hot core. The intensities of the C18O lines are well reproduced assuming\nthat the C18O abundance decreases through the protostellar envelope from the\nouter edge towards the centre until the point where the gas and dust reach the\nCO evaporation temperature (~20-25 K) where the C18O is released back to the\ngas phase. Once the C18O is released to the gas phase, the modelled C18O\nabundance is found to be ~1.6x10^{-8}, which is a factor of 10 lower than the\nreference abundance. This result is supported by the non-detection of C18O 9-8,\nwhich proves that even in the hot core (T_k>100 K) the CO abundance must be 10\ntimes lower than the reference value. Several scenarios are discussed to\nexplain this C18O deficiency. One possible explanation is that during the\npre-stellar and protostellar phase, the CO is removed from the grain mantles by\nreactions to form more complex molecules. Our HDO modeling shows that the\nemission of HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} line is maser and comes from the hot core\n(T_k>100 K). Assuming the physical structure derived by Crimier et al. (2010),\nwe determine a HDO abundance of ~0.4 - 1x10^{-7} in the hot core of this IM\nprotostar, similar to that found in the hot corinos NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and IRAS\n16293-2422.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 11:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We find that the central stellar mass density of high-z ETGs spans\njust an order of magnitude and it is similar to the one of local ETGs as\nactually found in previous studies.However, we find that the effective stellar\nmass density of high-z ETGs spans three orders of magnitude, exactly as the\nlocal ETGs and that it is similar to the effective stellar mass density of\nlocal ETGs showing that it has not changed since z~1.5, in the last 9-10 Gyr.\nThus, the wide spread of the effective stellar mass density observed up to\nz~1.5 must originate earlier, at z>2. Also, we show that the small scatter of\nthe central mass density of ETGs compared to the large scatter of the effective\nmass density is simply a peculiar feature of the Sersic profile hence,\nindependent of redshift and of any assembly history experienced by galaxies.\nThus, it has no connection with the possible inside-out growth of ETGs.\nFinally, we find a tight correlation between the central stellar mass density\nand the total stellar mass of ETGs in the sense that the central mass density\nincreases with mass as M^{~0.6}. This implies that the fraction of the central\nstellar mass of ETGs decreases with the mass of the galaxy. These correlations\nare valid for the whole population of ETGs considered independently of their\nredshift suggesting that they originate in the early-phases of their formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 12:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 15:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Very diverse algorithms and methods have been\nproposed to this end, many working reasonably well in specific situations.\nHowever, no consensus has emerged on which of these methods is the best to use\nin practice. In part, this is due to the fact that testing their performance\nrequires the generation of a comprehensive, standard set of synthetic\nbenchmarks, a goal not yet fully achieved. Here, we present a type of benchmark\nthat we call \"closed\", in which an initial network of known community structure\nis progressively converted into a second network whose communities are also\nknown. This approach differs from all previously published ones, in which\nnetworks evolve toward randomness. The use of this type of benchmark allows us\nto monitor the transformation of the community structure of a network.\nMoreover, we can predict the optimal behavior of the variation of information,\na measure of the quality of the partitions obtained, at any moment of the\nprocess. This enables us in many cases to determine the best partition among\nthose suggested by different algorithms. Also, since any network can be used as\na starting point, extensive studies and comparisons can be performed using a\nheterogeneous set of structures, including random ones.

The set of these paths can be equipped with a lattice\nstructure, called the m-Tamari lattice and denoted by T_n^{m}, which\ngeneralizes the usual Tamari lattice T_n obtained when m=1. This lattice was\nintroduced by F. Bergeron in connection with the study of diagonal coinvariant\nspaces in three sets of n variables. The representation of the symmetric group\nS_n on these spaces is conjectured to be closely related to the natural\nrepresentation of S_n on (labelled) intervals of the m-Tamari lattice, which we\nstudy in this paper. An interval [P,Q] of T_n^{m} is labelled if the north\nsteps of Q are labelled from 1 to n in such a way the labels increase along any\nsequence of consecutive north steps. The symmetric group S_n acts on labelled\nintervals of T_n^{m} by permutation of the labels. We prove an explicit\nformula, conjectured by F. Bergeron and the third author, for the character of\nthe associated representation of S_n. In particular, the dimension of the\nrepresentation, that is, the number of labelled m-Tamari intervals of size n,\nis found to be (m+1)^n(mn+1)^{n-2}. These results are new, even when m=1. The\nform of these numbers suggests a connection with parking functions, but our\nproof is not bijective. The starting point is a recursive description of\nm-Tamari intervals. It yields an equation for an associated generating\nfunction, which is a refined version of the Frobenius series of the\nrepresentation. This equation involves two additional variables x and y, a\nderivative with respect to y and iterated divided differences with respect to\nx.

First, we analyzed\nfailure cascades spreading from individual reactions and pairs of reactions and\ncompared the results to those in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. To\nalert to the potential damage caused by the failure of individual reactions, we\npropose a generic predictor based on local information that identifies target\nreactions for structural vulnerability. With respect to the simultaneous\nfailure of pairs of reactions, we detected strong non-linear amplification\neffects that can be predicted by the presence of specific motifs in the\nintersection of single cascades. We further connected the metabolic and gene\nco-expression networks of M. pneumoniae through enzyme activities, and studied\nthe consequences of knocking out individual genes and clusters of genes.

The report describes the detector performance required at CLIC, taking\ninto account the interaction point environment and especially beaminduced\nbackgrounds. Two detector concepts, designed around highly granular\ncalorimeters and based on concepts studied for the International Linear\nCollider (ILC), are described and used to study the physics reach and potential\nof such a collider. Detector subsystems and the principal engineering\nchallenges are illustrated. The overall performance of these CLIC detector\nconcepts is demonstrated by studies of the performance of individual\nsubdetector systems as well as complete simulation studies of six benchmark\nphysics processes. These full detector simulation and reconstruction studies\ninclude beaminduced backgrounds and physics background processes. After\noptimisation of the detector concepts and adopting the reconstruction\nalgorithms the results show very efficient background rejection and clearly\ndemonstrate the physics potential at CLIC in terms of precision mass and cross\nsection measurements. Finally, an overview of future plans of the CLIC detector\nand physics study is given and a list of key detector R&D topics needed for\ndetectors at CLIC is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 14:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-22"}

As these clouds\nare optically thick at short wavelength but optically thin at long wavelength,\nit is tricky to conclude anything about dust properties without a proper\ntreatment of the radiative transfer (RT). Our aim is to disentangle the effects\nof RT and of dust properties on the variations in the dust emission to provide\nobservers with keys to analyse the emission arising from dense clouds. We model\ncylindrical clouds, illuminated by the ISRF, and carry out full RT\ncalculations. Dust temperatures are solved using DustEM for amorphous carbons\nand silicates, grains coated with carbon mantles, and mixed aggregates of\ncarbon and silicate. We allow variations of the grain optical properties with\nwavelength and temperature. We determine observed colour temperatures, T, and\nemissivity spectral indices, beta, by fitting the dust emission with modified\nblackbodies, to compare our models with observations. RT effects can neither\nexplain the low T nor the increased submm emissivity measured at the centre of\ndense clouds, nor the observed beta-T anti-correlation. Adding noise to the\nmodelled data, we show that it is not likely to be the unique explanation for\nthe beta-T anti-correlation observed in starless clouds. It may be explained by\nintrinsic variations in the grain optical properties with temperature. As for\nthe increased submm emissivity and the low T, they have to originate in\nvariations in the grain optical properties, probably caused by their growth to\nform porous aggregates. We find it difficult to track back the nature of grains\nfrom the spectral variations in their emission. Finally, the column density is\nunderestimated when determined with blackbody fitting because of the\ndiscrepancy between T and the true dust temperature at the cloud centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 15:04:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 10:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The stability of the finite activity model is studied when\nthe option prices are observed in a sequence of trading days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 15:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 14:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 11:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

The purpose of such a simulation would be to obtain information about\nproblems which cannot be simulated with a classical computer due to the\nexponential increase of the Hilbert space with the size of the system and which\ncannot be measured or controlled in an actual experiment. The system will\ninteract with the surrounding environment, with the other particles in the\nsystem and be implemented using imperfect controls making it subject to noise.\nIt has been suggested that noise does not need to be controlled to the same\nextent as it must be for general quantum computing. However the effects of\nnoise in quantum simulations and how to treat them are not completely\nunderstood. In this paper we study an existing quantum algorithm for the\none-dimensional Fano-Anderson model to be simulated using a liquid-state NMR\ndevice. We calculate the evolution of different initial states in the original\nmodel, and then we add interacting spins to simulate a more realistic\nsituation. We find that states which are entangled with their environment, and\nsometimes correlated but not necessarily entangled have an evolution which is\ndescribed by maps which are not completely positive. We discuss the conditions\nfor this to occur and also the implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2012 23:04:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 00:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Our model constitutes a straightforward higher-order extension\nof the well known ROF functional (total variation minimisation) to which we add\na non-smooth second order regulariser. It combines convex functions of the\ntotal variation and the total variation of the first derivatives. In what\nfollows, we prove existence and uniqueness of minimisers of the combined model\nand present the numerical solution of the corresponding discretised problem by\nemploying the split Bregman method. The paper is furnished with applications of\nour model to image denoising, deblurring as well as image inpainting. The\nobtained numerical results are compared with results obtained from total\ngeneralised variation (TGV), infimal convolution and Euler's elastica, three\nother state of the art higher-order models. The numerical discussion confirms\nthat the proposed higher-order model competes with models of its kind in\navoiding the creation of undesirable artifacts and blocky-like structures in\nthe reconstructed images -- a known disadvantage of the ROF model -- while\nbeing simple and efficiently numerically solvable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 15:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 10:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

In our solution, each of the various characters from\nwhich a password could be composed is encoded with a random single digit\ninteger and presented to the user via an input interface form. A legitimate\nuser entering his password only needs to carefully study the sequence of code\nthat describe his password, and then enter these code in place of his actual\npassword characters. This approach does not require the input code to be hidden\nfrom anyone or converted to placeholder characters for security reasons. Our\nsolution engine regenerates new code for each character each time the carriage\nreturn key is struck, producing a hardened password that is convincingly more\nsecure than conventional password entry system against both online and offline\nattackers. Using empirical data and a prototype implementation of our scheme,\nwe give evidence that our approach is viable in practice, in terms of ease of\nuse, improved security, and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 14:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-01"}
