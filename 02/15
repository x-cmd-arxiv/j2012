Our\ncontribution is twofold. First, we provide an algorithm (based on exponential\nweights) with a regret of order $\\sqrt{d n \\log N}$ for any finite action set\nwith $N$ actions, under the assumption that the instantaneous loss is bounded\nby 1. This shaves off an extraneous $\\sqrt{d}$ factor compared to previous\nworks, and gives a regret bound of order $d \\sqrt{n \\log n}$ for any compact\nset of actions. Without further assumptions on the action set, this last bound\nis minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Interestingly, our result also\nshows that the minimax regret for bandit linear optimization with expert advice\nin $d$ dimension is the same as for the basic $d$-armed bandit with expert\nadvice.

These two processes lead to exchange of energy and\nmomentum between charged and neutral particles both upstream and downstream of\nthe shock. In particular, neutrals that suffer a charge exchange downstream\nwith shock-heated ions generate high velocity neutrals that have a finite\nprobability of returning upstream. These neutrals might then deposit heat in\nthe upstream plasma through ionization and charge exchange, thereby reducing\nthe fluid Mach number. A consequence of this phenomenon, that we refer to as\nthe \"neutral return flux\", is a reduction of the shock compression factor and\nthe formation of a shock precursor upstream. The scale length of the precursor\nis determined by the ionization and charge exchange interaction lengths of fast\nneutrals moving towards upstream infinity. In the case of a shock propagating\nin the interstellar medium, the effects of ion-neutral interactions are\nespecially important for shock velocities < 3000 km/s. Such propagation\nvelocities are common among shocks associated with supernova remnants, the\nprimary candidate sources for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. We then\ninvestigate the effects of the return flux of neutrals on the spectrum of\ntest-particles accelerated at the shock.

In this paper, we study outflows of\naccretion flows in the presence of resistivity and toroidal magnetic field. The\nmechanism of energy dissipation in the flow is assumed to be the viscosity and\nthe magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence in the accretion flow. It is also\nassumed that the magnetic diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity are not\nconstant and vary by position and $\\alpha$-prescription is used for them. The\ninfluence of outflow emanating from accretion disc is considered as a sink for\nmass, angular momentum and energy. The self-similar method is used to solve the\nintegrated equations that govern the behavior of the accretion flow in the\npresence of outflow. The solutions represent the disc which rotates faster and\nbecomes cooler for stronger outflows.

This has motivated our survey MASSIV of 0.9<z<1.9 star-forming\ngalaxies selected from the purely flux-limited VVDS redshift survey. For the\nfirst time, we derive the relations between galaxy size, mass, and internal\nvelocity, and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, from a statistically\nrepresentative sample of star-forming galaxies. We find a dynamical mass that\nagrees with those of rotating galaxies containing a gas fraction of ~20%,\nperfectly consistent with the content derived using the Kennicutt-Schmidt\nformulation and the expected evolution. Non-rotating galaxies have more compact\nsizes for their stellar component, and are less massive than rotators, but do\nnot have statistically different sizes for their gas-component. We measure a\nmarginal evolution in the size-stellar mass and size-velocity relations in\nwhich discs become evenly smaller with cosmic time at fixed stellar mass or\nvelocity, and are less massive at a given velocity than in the local Universe.\nThe scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation is smaller when we introduce the S05\nindex, which we interpret as evidence of an increase in the contribution to\ngalactic kinematics of turbulent motions with cosmic time.

Ground state results for\nfinite systems (with up to thousands of spins) are obtained using a projector\nQMC method. Great care has to be taken when extrapolating the order parameter\nto infinite size, in particular in cylinder geometry. Even though strong 2D VBS\norder exists and is established clearly with increasing system size on L*L\nlattices (or Lx* Ly lattices with a fixed Lx/Ly), only short-range VBS\ncorrelations are observed on long cylinders (when Lx -> infinity at fixed Ly).\nThe correlation length increases with Ly, until long-range order sets in at a\n\"critical\" Ly. This width is large even when the 2D order is strong, e.g, for a\nsystem where the order parameter is 70% of the largest possible value, Ly=8 is\nrequired for ordering. Correlation functions for small L*L lattices can also be\nmisleading. For a 20%-ordered system results for L up to 20 appear to\nextrapolate to a vanishing order parameter, while for larger L the behavior\ncrosses over and extrapolates to a non-zero value (with exponentially small\nfinite size corrections). The VBS order also exhibits interesting edge effects\nrelated to emergent U(1) symmetry, which, if not considered properly, can lead\nto wrong conclusions for the thermodynamic limit. The finite-size behavior for\nsmall L*L lattices and long cylinders is similar to that predicted for a Z2\nspin liquid. The results raise concerns about recent works claiming Z2 spin\nliquid ground states in frustrated 2D systems, in particular, the Heisenberg\nmodel with nearest and next-nearest-neighbor couplings. VBS state in this\nsystem cannot be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 19:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2012 04:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

This concerns the convergence of the logarithm of number\nof homomorphisms from graphs or hyper-graphs $\\G_N, N\\ge 1$ to some target\ngraph $W$. The theory of dense graph convergence, including random dense\ngraphs, is now well understood, but its counterpart for sparse random graphs\npresents some fundamental difficulties. Phrased in the statistical physics\nterminology, the issue is the existence of the log-partition function limits,\nalso known as free energy limits, appropriately normalized for the Gibbs\ndistribution associated with $W$. In this paper we prove that the sequence of\nsparse \\ER graphs is right-converging when the tensor product associated with\nthe target graph $W$ satisfies certain convexity property. We treat the case of\ndiscrete and continuous target graphs $W$. The latter case allows us to prove a\nspecial case of Talagrand's recent conjecture (more accurately stated as level\nIII Research Problem 6.7.2 in his recent book), concerning the existence of the\nlimit of the measure of a set obtained from $\\R^N$ by intersecting it with\nlinearly in $N$ many subsets, generated according to some common probability\nlaw.\n  Our proof is based on the interpolation technique, introduced first by Guerra\nand Toninelli and developed further in a series of papers.

We use the BAT dataset to\nrefine the determination of the LogN--LogS of AGN which is extremely important,\nnow that NuSTAR prepares for launch, towards assessing the AGN contribution to\nthe cosmic X-ray background. We show that the LogN--LogS of AGN selected above\n10 keV is now established to a ~10% precision. We derive the luminosity\nfunction of Compton-thick AGN and measure a space density of\n7.9$^{+4.1}_{-2.9}\\times10^{-5}$\\,Mpc$^{-3}$ for objects with a de-absorbed\nluminosity larger than 2$\\times10^{42}$\\,erg s$^{-1}$. As the BAT AGN are all\nmostly local, they allow us to investigate the spatial distribution of AGN in\nthe nearby Universe regardless of absorption. We find concentrations of AGN\nthat coincide spatially with the largest congregations of matter in the local\n(<85 Mpc) Universe. There is some evidence that the fraction of Seyfert 2\nobjects is larger than average in the direction of these dense regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The theory presents two entire\nfunctions, a.k.a. \"form factors\", and a finite number of local operators\nrequired by the quantum consistency of the theory itself. The main reason to\nintroduce the entire functions is to avoid ghosts (states of negative norm)\nlike the one in the four-dimensional Stelle's theory. The new theory is indeed\nghost-free since the two entire functions have the property to generalize the\nEinstein-Hilbert action without introducing new poles in the propagator. The\ntheory is renormalizable at one loop and finite from two loops upward. In this\npaper we essentially study three classes of form factors, systematically\nshowing the tree-level unitarity. We prove that the gravitation potential is\nregular in r = 0 for all the choices of form factors compatible with\nrenormalizability and unitarity. We also include Black hole spherical symmetric\nsolutions omitting higher curvature corrections to the equation of motions. For\ntwo out of three form factors the solutions are regular and the classical\nsingularity is replaced by a \"de Sitter-like core\" in r=0.

Clustering,\ncommunity structure and assortative mixing by degree are perhaps among most\nprominent examples of the latter. Although generally accepted for social\nnetworks, these properties only partially explain the structure of other\nnetworks. We first show that degree-corrected clustering is in contrast to\nstandard definition highly assortative. Yet interesting on its own, we further\nnote that non-social networks contain connected regions with very low\nclustering. Hence, the structure of real-world networks is beyond communities.\nWe here investigate the concept of functional modules---groups of regularly\nequivalent nodes---and show that such structures could explain for the\nproperties observed in non-social networks. Real-world networks might be\ncomposed of functional modules that are overlaid by communities. We support the\nlatter by proposing a simple network model that generates scale-free\nsmall-world networks with tunable clustering and degree mixing. Model has a\nnatural interpretation in many real-world networks, while it also gives\ninsights into an adequate community extraction framework. We also present an\nalgorithm for detection of arbitrary structural modules without any prior\nknowledge.

Energy consumers are shielded\nfrom making price-aware decisions, which degrades the efficiency of the market.\nThis state of affairs tends to favor fossil fuel generation over renewable\nsources. Because of the technological difficulties of storing electric energy,\nthe quest for mechanisms that would make the demand for electricity\ncontrollable on a day-to-day basis is gaining prominence. The goal of this\npaper is to provide one such mechanisms, which we call Digital Direct Load\nScheduling (DDLS). DDLS is a direct load control mechanism in which we unbundle\nindividual requests for energy and digitize them so that they can be\nautomatically scheduled in a cellular architecture. Specifically, rather than\nstoring energy or interrupting the job of appliances, we choose to hold\nrequests for energy in queues and optimize the service time of individual\nappliances belonging to a broad class which we refer to as \"deferrable loads\".\nThe function of each neighborhood scheduler is to optimize the time at which\nthese appliances start to function. This process is intended to shape the\naggregate load profile of the neighborhood so as to optimize an objective\nfunction which incorporates the spot price of energy, and also allows\ndistributed energy resources to supply part of the generation dynamically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 02:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Recent observations indicate that these ratios can be variable with\ntime.\n  The possible causes of variation in line ratios are limited: changes in the\nradiation field or changes in density, and changes in mass-loss or geometry. In\nthis paper, we investigate the ability of changes in the radiation field to\ninduce variability in the ratio R=f/i.\n  To isolate the radiative effect, we use a heuristic model of temperature and\nradius changes in variable stars in the B and O range with low-density,\nsteady-state winds. We model the changes in emissivity of X-ray emitting gas\nclose to the star due to differences in level-pumping from available UV photons\nat the location of the gas.\n  We find that under these conditions, variability in R is dominated by the\nstellar temperature. Although the relative amplitude of variability is roughly\ncomparable for most lines at most temperatures, detectable variations are\nlimited to a few lines for each spectral type. We predict that variable values\nin R due to stellar variability must follow predictable trends found in our\nsimulations.\n  Our model uses radial pulsations as a mode of stellar variability that\nmaximizes the amplitude of variation in R. This model is robust enough to show\nwhich ions will provide the best opportunity for observing variability in the\nf/i ratio at different stellar temperatures, and the correlation of that\nvariability with other observable parameters. In real systems, the effects\nwould be more complex than in our model, with differences in phase and\nsuppressed amplitude in the presence of non-radial pulsations. This suggests\nthat changes in R across many lines concurrently are not likely to be produced\nby a variable radiation field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 02:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Using this\ntechnique, we investigated the sources of CH3OH and HCN in comet 103P/Hartley\n2, the target of NASA's EPOXI mission, which had an exceptionally favorable\napparition in late 2010.

The mixing ratio of CH3OH and HCN is dramatically different in the\ntwo jets, which evidently shows large-scale chemical heterogeneity of the\nnucleus.

In this loop, as in many\nsequential loops, each iterate will only depend directly on a subset of the\nprevious iterates (i.e. knowing that any one of a vertices neighbors is in the\nMIS or knowing that it has no previous neighbors is sufficient to decide its\nfate). This leads to a dependence structure among the iterates. If this\nstructure is shallow then running the iterates in parallel while respecting the\ndependencies can lead to an efficient parallel implementation mimicking the\nsequential algorithm.\n  In this paper, we show that for any graph, and for a random ordering of the\nvertices, the dependence depth of the sequential greedy MIS algorithm is\npolylogarithmic (O(log^2 n) with high probability). Our results extend previous\nresults that show polylogarithmic bounds only for random graphs. We show\nsimilar results for a greedy maximal matching (MM). For both problems we\ndescribe simple linear work parallel algorithms based on the approach.

Coupled wildfire-atmosphere models are physics-based\nfluid-dynamical prognostic models of wildfire spread and behavior that attempt\nan almost complete representation of fire-atmosphere interactions. This level\nof fidelity however means that these models cannot be used operationally. The\nreason is that, despite ever increasing computational resources, the complexity\nand range of processes and scales (1 mm to 100 km) involved in this modeling\napproach make computational costs prohibitively expensive.

Different adaptions of the Arnoldi\nmethod are often used to compute partial Schur factorizations. We propose here\na technique to compute a partial Schur factorization of a nonlinear eigenvalue\nproblem (NEP). The technique is inspired by the algorithm in [8], now called\nthe infinite Arnoldi method. The infinite Arnoldi method is a method designed\nfor NEPs, and can be interpreted as Arnoldi's method applied to a linear\ninfinite-dimensional operator, whose reciprocal eigenvalues are the solutions\nto the NEP. As a first result we show that the invariant pairs of the operator\nare equivalent to invariant pairs of the NEP. We characterize the structure of\nthe invariant pairs of the operator and show how one can carry out a\nmodification of the infinite Arnoldi method by respecting the structure.

Re-evaluation of dynamical\nstability models as well as more sophisticated evolution models of Jupiter with\ncore erosion seem to be required in order to provide more robust estimates for\nJupiter's primordial NMOI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 09:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Motivated\nby spectral and other algebraic characterizations of distance-regular graphs,\nwe study `almost distance-regular graphs'. We use this name informally for\ngraphs that share some regularity properties that are related to distance in\nthe graph. For example, a known characterization of a distance-regular graph is\nthe invariance of the number of walks of given length between vertices at a\ngiven distance, while a graph is called walk-regular if the number of closed\nwalks of given length rooted at any given vertex is a constant. One of the\nconcepts studied here is a generalization of both distance-regularity and\nwalk-regularity called $m$-walk-regularity. Another studied concept is that of\n$m$-partial distance-regularity or, informally, distance-regularity up to\ndistance $m$. Using eigenvalues of graphs and the predistance polynomials, we\ndiscuss and relate these and other concepts of almost distance-regularity, such\nas their common generalization of $(\\ell,m)$-walk-regularity.

We tested the stability of 2008 LC18's orbit\nthrough a detailed dynamical study, using test particles spread across the\norbital uncertainties in a, e, i and {\\Omega}. This showed that the wide\nuncertainties of the published orbit span regions of both extreme dynamical\ninstability, with lifetimes < 100 Myr, and with significant stability (> 1 Gyr\nlifetimes). The stability of 2008 LC18's clones is greatly dependent on their\nsemi-major axis and only weakly correlated with their eccentricity. Test\nparticles on orbits with an initial semi-major axis less than 29.91 AU have\ndynamical half-lives shorter than 100 Myr; in contrast, particles with an\ninitial semi-major axis greater than 29.91 AU exhibit such strong dynamical\nstability that almost all are retained over the 1 Gyr of our simulations. More\nobservations of this object are necessary to improve the orbit. If 2008 LC18 is\nin the unstable region, then our simulations imply that it is either a\ntemporary Trojan capture, or a representative of a slowly decaying Trojan\npopulation (like its sibling the L4 Neptunian Trojan 2001 QR322), and that it\nmay not be primordial. Alternatively, if the orbit falls into the larger,\nstable region, then 2008 LC18 is a primordial member of the highly stable and\nhighly inclined component of the Neptune Trojan population, joining 2005 TN53\nand 2007 VL305. We attempted to recover 2008 LC18 using the 2.3m telescope at\nSiding Spring Observatory to provide this astrometry, but were unsuccessful due\nto the high stellar density of its current sky location near the galactic\ncentre. The recovery of this object will require a telescope in the 8m class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 11:11:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 09:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Its close\nproximity and apparent isolation provide a unique opportunity to study galactic\nevolution without any obvious strong external influences. This paper aims to\nstudy the spatial distribution of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) population\nand metallicity in NGC 6822. Using deep, high quality JHK photometry, taken\nwith WFCAM on UKIRT, carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars have been isolated. The\nratio between their number, the C/M ratio, has then been used to derive the\n[Fe/H] abundance across the galaxy. The tip of the red giant branch is located\nat K0 = 17.41 \\pm 0.11 mag and the colour separation between carbon- and\noxygen-rich AGB stars is at (J - K)0 = 1.20 \\pm 0.03 mag (i.e. (J - K)2MAS S\n{\\guillemotright} 1.28 mag). A C/M ratio of 0.62 \\pm 0.03 has been derived in\nthe inner 4 kpc of the galaxy, which translates into an iron abundance of\n[Fe/H] = -1.29\\pm0.07 dex. Variations of these parameters were investigated as\na function of distance from the galaxy centre and azimuthal angle. The AGB\npopulation of NGC 6822 has been detected out to a radius of 4 kpc giving a\ndiameter of 56 arcmin. It is metal-poor, but there is no obvious gradient in\nmetallicity with either radial distance from the centre or azimuthal angle. The\ndetected spread in the TRGB magnitude is consistent with that of a galaxy\nsurrounded by a halo of old stars. The C/M ratio has the potential to be a very\nuseful tool for the determination of metallicity in resolved galaxies but a\nbetter calibration of the C/M vs. [Fe/H] relation and a better understanding of\nthe sensitivities of the C/M ratio to stellar selection criteria is first\nrequired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 11:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 16:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

While long-lived excitons are simply cooled to\nvery low temperatures using cryogenic apparatus, engineering confining\npotentials has been a challenging task. This degree of control was only\nachieved recently with devices realized by highly demanding nano-fabrication\nprocesses.

Accordingly, any confinement geometry can be realized by\nshaping the spatial profile of a laser excitation.

Results: During the\nunusually deep and extended activity minimum of 2009, the Sun reached S-index\nvalues considerably lower than in any of its previously observed minima.

In particular,\nthe SSB of antisymmetric modes is possible solely in the two-component system,\nand, obviously, S-AS states exist only in the two-component system too. In the\ngeneral case of the symmetric pair of finite-width nonlinear potential wells,\nevolution scenarios are very complex. In this case, new results are reported,\nfirst, for the single-component model. These are pairs of broken-antisymmetry\nmodes, and of twin-peak symmetric ones, which are generated by saddle-mode\nbifurcations separated from the transformations previously studied in the the\nsingle-component setting.

With the assumption of Saha equilibrium, the variation in\ntemperature is the main driver of the variations in the electrical\nconductivity, induced current and Ohmic power dissipated. Atmospheres\npossessing temperature inversions tend to dissipate most of the Ohmic power\nsuperficially, at high altitudes, whereas those without temperature inversions\nare capable of greater dissipation deeper down. Scattering in the optical range\nof wavelengths tends to cool the lower atmosphere, thus reducing the degree of\ndissipation at depth. Purely absorbing cloud decks (in the infrared), of a\nfinite extent in height, allow for localized reductions in dissipation and may\nreverse a temperature inversion if they are dense and thick enough, thus\ngreatly enhancing the dissipation at depth. If Ohmic dissipation is the\nmechanism for inflating hot Jupiters, then variations in the atmospheric\nopacity (which may be interpreted as arising from variations in metallicity and\ncloud/haze properties) and magnetic field strength naturally produce a scatter\nin the measured radii at a given strength of irradiation.

Our algorithm uses bounds derived from\nanalysis of coarse timescales to prune large parts of the state trellis at\nfiner timescales. We demonstrate improvements of several orders of magnitude\nover the standard Viterbi algorithm, as well as significant speedups over CFDP,\nfor problems whose state variables evolve at widely differing rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

We propose a Kernel-based Conditional Independence\ntest (KCI-test), by constructing an appropriate test statistic and deriving its\nasymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence.\nThe proposed method is computationally efficient and easy to implement.\nExperimental results show that it outperforms other methods, especially when\nthe conditioning set is large or the sample size is not very large, in which\ncase other methods encounter difficulties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

The underlying optimization problem is currently\nsolved using cutting plane methods such as SVM-Perf and BMRM. One can show that\nthese algorithms converge to an eta accurate solution in O(1/Lambda*e)\niterations, where lambda is the trade-off parameter between the regularizer and\nthe loss function. We present a smoothing strategy for multivariate performance\nscores, in particular precision/recall break-even point and ROCArea. When\ncombined with Nesterov's accelerated gradient algorithm our smoothing strategy\nyields an optimization algorithm which converges to an eta accurate solution in\nO(min{1/e,1/sqrt(lambda*e)}) iterations. Furthermore, the cost per iteration of\nour scheme is the same as that of SVM-Perf and BMRM. Empirical evaluation on a\nnumber of publicly available datasets shows that our method converges\nsignificantly faster than cutting plane methods without sacrificing\ngeneralization ability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

However, belief propagation over junction tree is known to\nbe computationally intensive in the general case. Its complexity may increase\ndramatically with the connectivity and state space cardinality of Bayesian\nnetwork nodes. In this paper, we address this computational challenge using GPU\nparallelization. We develop data structures and algorithms that extend existing\njunction tree techniques, and specifically develop a novel approach to\ncomputing each belief propagation message in parallel. We implement our\napproach on an NVIDIA GPU and test it using BNs from several applications.\nExperimentally, we study how junction tree parameters affect parallelization\nopportunities and hence the performance of our algorithm. We achieve speedups\nranging from 0.68 to 9.18 for the BNs studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}
