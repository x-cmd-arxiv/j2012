In our experiments, we used the King and Wells method for measuring the\nsticking coefficients of H2 and D2 molecules on a silicate surface held at 10\nK. It consists of measuring with a QMS (quadrupole mass spectrometer) the\nsignals of H2 and D2 molecules reflected by the surface during the exposure of\nthe sample to the molecular beam at a temperature ranging from 20 K to 340 K.\nWe tested the efficiency of a physical model, developed previously for sticking\non water-ice surfaces. We applied this model to our experimental results for\nthe sticking coefficients of H2 and D2 molecules on a silicate surface and\nestimated the sticking coefficient of atoms by a single measurement of atomic\nrecombination and propose an extrapolation. Sticking of H, D, HD, H2, and D2 on\nsilicates grains behaves the same as on icy dust grains. The sticking decreases\nwith the gas temperature, and is dependent on the mass of the impactor. The\nsticking coefficient for both surfaces and impactors can be modeled by an\nanalytical formulae S(T), which describes both the experiments and the thermal\ndistribution expected in an astrophysical context. The parameters S0 and T0 are\nsummarized in a table.

Using a M1 closure\nscheme with an analytic variable Eddington factor, we solve the\nenergy-independent set of radiation energy and momentum based on the Thorne's\nmomentum formalism. To simplify the source terms of the transport equations, a\nmethodology of multiflavour neutrino leakage scheme is partly employed. Our\nnewly developed code is designed to evolve the Einstein field equation together\nwith the GR radiation hydrodynamic equations. We follow the dynamics starting\nfrom the onset of gravitational core-collapse of a 15 $M_{\\odot}$ star, through\nbounce, up to about 100 ms postbounce in this study to study how the spacial\nmulti-dimensionality and GR would affect the dynamics in the early postbounce\nphase. Our 3D results support the anticipation in previous 1D results that the\nneutrino luminosity and average neutrino energy of any neutrino flavor in the\npostbounce phase increase when switching from SR to GR hydrodynamics. This is\nbecause the deeper gravitational well of GR produces more compact core\nstructures, and thus hotter neutrino spheres at smaller radii. By analyzing the\nresidency timescale to the neutrino-heating timescale in the gain region, we\nshow that the criterion to initiate neutrino-driven explosions can be most\neasily satisfied in 3D models, irrespective of SR or GR hydrodynamics. Our\nresults suggest that the combination of GR and 3D hydrodynamics provides the\nmost favorable condition to drive a robust neutrino-driven explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2012 03:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 06:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This\ncapability is called auto-scaling and its main purpose is to automatically\nadjust the scale of the system that is running the application to satisfy the\nvarying workload with minimum resource utilization. The need for auto-scaling\nis particularly important during workload peaks, in which applications may need\nto scale up to extremely large-scale systems.\n  Both the research community and the main cloud providers have already\ndeveloped auto-scaling solutions. However, most research solutions are\ncentralized and not suitable for managing large-scale systems, moreover cloud\nproviders' solutions are bound to the limitations of a specific provider in\nterms of resource prices, availability, reliability, and connectivity.\n  In this paper we propose DEPAS, a decentralized probabilistic auto-scaling\nalgorithm integrated into a P2P architecture that is cloud provider\nindependent, thus allowing the auto-scaling of services over multiple cloud\ninfrastructures at the same time. Our simulations, which are based on real\nservice traces, show that our approach is capable of: (i) keeping the overall\nutilization of all the instantiated cloud resources in a target range, (ii)\nmaintaining service response times close to the ones obtained using optimal\ncentralized auto-scaling approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2012 09:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

Cand\\`es, Romberg, Tao introduced a scheme that acquires instantaneous\nsamples of the signal at random times. They proved that the signal can be\nuniquely and efficiently reconstructed, provided the sampling rate exceeds the\nfrequency support of the signal, times logarithmic factors.\n  In this paper we consider a probabilistic model for the signal, and a\nsampling scheme inspired by the idea of spatial coupling in coding theory.\nNamely, we propose to acquire non-instantaneous samples at random times.\nMathematically, this is implemented by acquiring a small random subset of Gabor\ncoefficients. We show empirically that this scheme achieves correct\nreconstruction as soon as the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of\nthe signal, thus reaching the information theoretic limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2012 12:43:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 03:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-22"}
