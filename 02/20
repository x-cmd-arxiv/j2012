The aim of\nthis work is to search for the imprint of the environment on the chemical\nevolution of these galaxies. Galaxy chemical evolution is linked to the star\nformation history (SFH), as well as to the gas interchange with the\nenvironment, and low-mass galaxies are well known to be vulnerable systems to\nenvironmental processes affecting both these parameters. For our study we have\nused spectra from the SDSS-III DR8. We have examined the mass-metallicity\nrelation of cluster galaxies finding well defined sequences. The slope of these\nsequences, for galaxies in low-mass clusters and galaxies at large\ncluster-centric distances, follows the predictions of recent hydrodynamic\nmodels. A flattening of this slope has been observed for galaxies located in\nthe core of the two more massive clusters of the sample, principally in Coma,\nsuggesting that the imprint of the cluster environment on the chemical\nevolution of SF galaxies should be sensitive to both the galaxy mass and the\nhost cluster mass. The HI gas content of Coma and A1367 galaxies indicate that\nlow-mass SF galaxies, located at the core of these clusters, have been severely\naffected by ram-pressure stripping. The observed mass-dependent enhancement of\nthe metal content of low-mass galaxies in dense environments seems plausible,\naccording to hydrodynamic simulations. This enhanced metal enrichment could be\nproduced by the combination of effects such as wind reaccretion, due to\npressure cofinement by the intra-cluster medium (ICM), and the truncation of\ngas infall, as a result of the ram-pressure stripping. Thus, the properties of\nthe ICM should play an important role in the chemical evolution of low-mass\ngalaxies in clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2012 16:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Thus, we deal with successive iterations applied to\nrectangular arrays of numbers, where to avoid technical difficulties an array\nhas at least three rows and at least three columns. Without loss, an iteration\nbegins with operations on columns: first subtract the mean of each column; then\ndivide by its standard deviation. The iteration continues with the same two\noperations done successively for rows. These four operations applied in\nsequence completes one iteration. One then iterates again, and again, and\nagain,.... In Olshen and Rajaratnam (2010) it was argued that if arrays are\nmade up of real numbers, then the set for which convergence of these successive\niterations fails has Lebesgue measure 0. The limiting array has row and column\nmeans 0, row and column standard deviations 1. A basic result on convergence\ngiven in Olshen and Rajaratnam (2010) is true, though the argument in Olshen\nand Rajaratnam (2010) is faulty. The result is stated in the form of a theorem\nhere, and the argument for the theorem is correct. Moreover, many graphics\ngiven in Olshen and Rajaratnam (2010) suggest that but for a set of entries of\nany array with Lebesgue measure 0, convergence is very rapid, eventually\nexponentially fast in the number of iterations. Because we learned this set of\nrules from Bradley Efron, we call it \"Efron's algorithm\". More importantly, the\nrapidity of convergence is illustrated by numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 00:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

In SRC, the testing image is coded\nas a sparse linear combination of the training samples, and the representation\nfidelity is measured by the l2-norm or l1-norm of the coding residual. Such a\nsparse coding model assumes that the coding residual follows Gaussian or\nLaplacian distribution, which may not be effective enough to describe the\ncoding residual in practical FR systems. Meanwhile, the sparsity constraint on\nthe coding coefficients makes SRC's computational cost very high. In this\npaper, we propose a new face coding model, namely regularized robust coding\n(RRC), which could robustly regress a given signal with regularized regression\ncoefficients. By assuming that the coding residual and the coding coefficient\nare respectively independent and identically distributed, the RRC seeks for a\nmaximum a posterior solution of the coding problem. An iteratively reweighted\nregularized robust coding (IR3C) algorithm is proposed to solve the RRC model\nefficiently. Extensive experiments on representative face databases demonstrate\nthat the RRC is much more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art sparse\nrepresentation based methods in dealing with face occlusion, corruption,\nlighting and expression changes, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 02:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 08:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We\nanalytically treat this problem and calculate the Laplacian spectrum for the\nfirst time, and approximate the eigenvalues and eigenstates using the Chebyshev\npolynomial technique and perturbation theory. It is found that the probability\nevolution exhibits a similar behavior like the cycle if the exciton starts far\naway from the two ends of the added link.

In this article, we focused on\nadult starfish behaviors to corroborate its bilateral tendency. We weighed\ntheir central disk and each arm to measure the position of the center of\ngravity. We then studied their turning-over behavior, crawling behavior and\nfleeing behavior statistically to obtain the center of frequency of each\nbehavior. By joining the center of gravity and each center of frequency, we\nobtained three behavioral symmetric planes. These behavioral bilateral\ntendencies might be related to the A/P axis during the embryonic development of\nthe starfish. It is very likely that the adult starfish is, to some extent,\nbilaterian because it displays some bilateral propensity and has a definite\nbehavioral symmetric plane. The remainder of bilateral symmetry may have\nbenefited echinoderms during their evolution from the Cambrian period to the\npresent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 03:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A viscous stability criterion is\nderived and compared to numerical results obtained for various libration\nfrequencies and Ekman numbers.

This assumption is used\nto derive the spatial derivatives of other quantities. However, this assumption\nbreaks down at the contact discontinuity. At the contact discontinuity, the\ndensity of the low-density side is overestimated while that of the high-density\nside is underestimated. As a result, the pressure of the low (high) density\nside is over (under) estimated. Thus, unphysical repulsive force appears at the\ncontact discontinuity, resulting in the effective surface tension. This tension\nsuppresses fluid instabilities. In this paper, we present a new formulation of\nSPH, which does not require the differentiability of density. Instead of the\nmass density, we adopt the internal energy density (pressure), and its\narbitrary function, which are smoothed quantities at the contact discontinuity,\nas the volume element used for the kernel integration. We call this new\nformulation density independent SPH (DISPH). It handles the contact\ndiscontinuity without numerical problems. The results of standard tests such as\nthe shock tube, Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, point like\nexplosion, and blob tests are all very favorable to DISPH. We conclude that\nDISPH solved most of known difficulties of the standard SPH, without\nintroducing additional numerical diffusion or breaking the exact force symmetry\nor energy conservation.

There\nmay then exist a mutual self-stabilization of the wave amplitude together with\nthe irregular morphology of the coast. A simple model of this type of\nstabilization is discussed. The resulting coastline morphologies are diverse,\ndepending mainly on the morphology/damping coupling. In the limit case of weak\ncoupling, the process spontaneously builds fractal morphologies with a\ndimension close to 4/3. This provides a direct connection between the coastal\nerosion problem and the theory of percolation. For strong coupling, rugged but\nnon-fractal coasts may emerge during the erosion process, and we investigate a\ngeometrical characterization in these cases. The model is minimal, but can be\nextended to take into account heterogeneity in the rock lithology and various\ninitial conditions.

One of the\nmethods how regular forces are determined is the measurement of the drift\nvelocity of Brownian particles. We have obtained an exact expression for this\nvelocity within the hydrodynamic theory of the Brownian motion. It is shown\nthat the influence of the inertial and memory effects can be significant in the\nforce determination when the experimental times are sufficiently short.

Our objects are elongated, resembling visually S0 galaxies, and have\na central stellar mass density well above the stellar mass densities of objects\nwith similar stellar mass but normal size in the present universe.

To perform meaningful comparisons across networks with\ndifferent characteristics, we define a stochastic benchmark for the number of\nconnections among each country-pair, based on hypergeometric distribution.\nOriginal data are thus filtered by means of different thresholds, so that we\nonly focus on the strongest links, i.e., statistically significant links. We\nfind that trade in bits displays a sparser and less hierarchical network\nstructure, which is more similar to trade in high-skill manufactured goods than\ntotal trade. Lastly, distance plays a more prominent role in shaping the\nnetwork of international trade in physical goods than trade in digital\nservices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 14:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

As a\nresult, the roles of rotation, mass loss and accretion in massive star\nformation are not well understood. This study evaluates the source of the\nQ-band, lambda=19.5 microns, emission of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs).\nThis allows us to determine the relative importance of rotation and outflow\nactivity in shaping the circumstellar environments of MYSOs on 1000 AU scales.\nWe obtained diffraction limited mid-infrared images of a sample of 20 MYSOs\nusing the VLT/VISIR and Subaru/COMICS instruments. For these 8 m class\ntelescopes and the sample selected, the diffraction limit, ~0.6\", corresponds\nto approximately 1000 AU. We compare the images and the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) observed to a 2D, axis-symmetric dust radiative transfer\nmodel that reproduces VLTI/MIDI observations of the MYSO W33A. We vary the\ninclination, mass infall rate, and outflow opening angle to simultaneously\nrecreate the behaviour of the sample of MYSOs in the spatial and spectral\ndomains. The mid-IR emission of 70 percent of the MYSOs is spatially resolved.\nIn the majority of cases, the spatial extent of their emission and their SEDs\ncan be reproduced by the W33A model featuring an in-falling, rotating dusty\nenvelope with outflow cavities. There is independent evidence that most of the\nsources which are not fit by the model are associated with ultracompact HII\nregions and are thus more evolved. We find that, in general, the diverse 20\nmicron morphology of MYSOs can be attributed to warm dust in the walls of\noutflow cavities seen at different inclinations. This implies that the warm\ndust in the outflow cavity walls dominates the Q-band emission of MYSOs. In\nturn, this emphasises that outflows are an ubiquitous feature of massive star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 15:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Such\nmodification of the element profiles will lead to an increase of the opacity in\nthe region just above the H-burning shell and a decrease of the opacity in the\nouter homogeneous convection zone, which will result in a quick decrease of the\nH-shell nuclear luminosity $L_{H}$ when the stellar model evolves from the RGB\ntip to its bottom and, finally, a much weaker and smaller convection zone will\nbe obtained in the stellar envelope. This helps to form a longer blue loop. The\nextension of the blue loop is very sensitive to the parameters $(C_{X}$ and\n$\\alpha_{TCM})$ of the diffusive mixing model and of the TCM. The results\nmainly show that: 1) comparing to the results of the classical model with the\nmixing-length theory, the lengths of the obtained blue loops with different\ncombinations of the values of $C_{X}$ and $\\alpha_{TCM}$ are all increased and\nthe length of the blue loop increases with the values of parameters\n  $C_{X}$ and $\\alpha_{TCM}$; 2) the diffusive mixing model can significantly\nextend the time of stellar models lingering on the blue side of the HR diagram,\neven though the length of the blue loop for the 7$M_{\\odot}$ star has a less\nprominent difference between the classical and diffusive mixing model;\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 15:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) observations from the STEREO and SDO\nspacecraft are used here to study their kinematics and morphology. The first\nSTEREO observations of a CBF are presented, with the pulse observed in all\navailable EUV passbands (171, 195, 284 and for the first time, 304A). The pulse\ndisplayed similar kinematics in all passbands, although the derived pulse\nvelocity and acceleration were found to be strongly influenced by the observing\ncadence, implying that previous kinematics may have been underestimated.\nDifferent techniques for identifying CBFs and deriving their true kinematics\nwere tested, with traditional techniques shown to be prone to undefined\nuser-dependent errors. This was overcome through the development of a\nstatistically rigorous, semi-automated identification algorithm, which was then\nused to determine the kinematics of four CBF events observed by STEREO. All of\nthe events studied exhibited clear deceleration as well as increases in both\nspatial and temporal pulse width, indicating that the CBFs are dispersive. A\nCBF pulse observed by both STEREO and SDO was also studied using the algorithm,\nwith lower initial velocity and weaker deceleration noted in STEREO\nobservations compared to SDO, reaffirming the effects of image cadence on the\nderived kinematics. The kinematics obtained using SDO were highly passband\ndependent, suggesting a compressive nature. Significant pulse broadening was\nalso noted in observations from both spacecraft, allowing the dispersion rate\nof the pulse to be determined. These results indicate that coronal bright\nfronts are best interpreted as fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves propagating in\nan inhomogeneous medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 15:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}
