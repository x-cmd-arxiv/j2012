In this paper we\ndevelop an electromagnetic model of short GRBs that explains the two stages of\nthe energy release, the prompt spike and the prompt tail. The key ingredient of\nthe model is the recent discovery that an isolated black hole can keep its open\nmagnetic flux for times much longer than the collapse time and, thus, can\nspin-down electromagnetically, driving the relativistic wind.\n  First, the merger is preceded by an electromagnetic precursor wind. If a\nfraction of the wind power is converted into pulsar-like coherent radio\nemission, this may produce an observable radio burst of few milliseconds.\n  At the active stage of the merger, two neutron stars produces a black hole\nsurrounded by an accretion torus in which the amplified magnetic field extracts\nthe rotational energy of the black hole and drives an axially-collimated\nelectromagnetic wind. For observers nearly aligned with the orbital normal this\nis seen as a classical short GRB.\n  After the accretion of the torus, the isolated black hole keeps the open\nmagnetic flux and drives the equatorially (not axially) collimated outflow,\nwhich is seen by an observer at intermediate polar angles as a prompt tail. The\ntail carries more energy than the prompt spike, but its emission is de-boosted\nfor observers along the orbital normal. Observers in the equatorial plane miss\nthe prompt spike and interpret the prompt tail as an energetic supernova-less\nlong GRB.\n  We also demonstrate that episodic accretion onto the BH of magnetized clouds\nthat carry non-zero magnetic flux can be highly efficient in extracting the\nspin energy of the BH, producing the outflows with the power exceeding the\naverage accretion power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 19:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 14:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

On one hand,\nradiative emission drastically decreases the thermal energy content of the\ninterstellar plasma (ISM), inducing a slow cooling flow toward the centre. On\nthe other hand, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) struggles to prevent the\nrunaway cooling catastrophe, injecting huge amount of energy in the ISM. The\npresent study intends to deeply investigate the role of mechanical AGN feedback\nin (isolated or massive) elliptical galaxies, extending and completing the mass\nrange of tested cosmic environments. Our previously successful feedback models,\nin galaxy clusters and groups, demonstrated that AGN outflows, self-regulated\nby cold gas accretion, are able to properly quench the cooling flow, without\ndestroying the cool core. Via 3D hydrodynamic simulations (FLASH 3.3),\nincluding also stellar evolution, we show that massive mechanical AGN outflows\ncan indeed solve the cooling flow problem for the entire life of the galaxy, at\nthe same time reproducing typical observational features and constraints, such\nas buoyant underdense bubbles, elliptical shock cocoons, sonic ripples,\ndredge-up of metals, subsonic turbulence, and extended filamentary or nuclear\ncold gas. In order to avoid overheating and totally emptying the isolated\ngalaxy, the frequent mechanical AGN feedback should be less powerful and\nefficient (~1.e-4), compared to the heating required for more massive and bound\nellipticals surrounded by the intragroup medium (efficiency ~1.e-3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 May 2012 11:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Contrary to claims of a\nlarge intrinsic scatter, we find that the GDR data can be fully accounted for\nusing observational errors alone. Consistently, we find no evidence for a\ncorrelation between GDR and cluster mass (via Tx or weak lensing). Lastly, the\ndata suggest that the evolution of the GDR at z < 0.2 is driven primarily by\ndry merging of the massive giant galaxies, which when considered with previous\nresults at higher redshift, suggests a change in the dominant mechanism that\nmediates the GDR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 06:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We rule out much of parameter space, except where\nNeptune is scattered to a moderately eccentric orbit (e > 0.15) and\nsubsequently migrates a distance Delta aN=1-6 AU. Neptune's moderate\neccentricity must either damp quickly or be accompanied by fast apsidal\nprecession.

This method has\nbeen applied to observations of a sample of nine S0s in the Fornax Cluster in\norder to obtain clean high-quality spectra of their individual bulge and disc\ncomponents. So far this decomposition has only been fully successful when\napplied to galaxies with clean light profiles, consequently limiting the number\nof galaxies that could be separated into bulge and disc components. Lick index\nstellar population analysis of the component spectra reveals that in those\ngalaxies where the bulge and disc could be distinguished, the bulges have\nsystematically higher metallicities and younger stellar populations than the\ndiscs. This correlation is consistent with a picture in which S0 formation\ncomprises the shutting down of star formation in the disc accompanied by a\nfinal burst of star formation in the bulge. The variation in spatial-fit\nparameters with wavelength also allows us to measure approximate colour\ngradients in the individual components. Such gradients were detected separately\nin both bulges and discs, in the sense that redder light is systematically more\ncentrally concentrated in all components. However, a search for radial\nvariations in the absorption line strengths determined for the individual\ncomponents revealed that they are absent from the vast majority of S0 discs and\nbulges. The absence of gradients in line indices for most galaxies implies that\nthe colour gradient cannot be attributed to age or metallicity variations, and\nis therefore most likely associated with varying degrees of obscuration by\ndust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

However, optical fibers induce nonlinear effects,\nespecially self-phase modulation (SPM). We studied SPM in our photonic crystal\nfiber (PCF). SPM broadens the spectrum of a laser beam and decrease the\nefficiency of bright laser guide star generation. We measured the spectrum\nwidth using a spectrum analyzer. We found a spectrum width of 8.4 GHz at full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM). The original FWHM of our laser spectrum was 1.4\nGHz. This was equivalent to a 70 % loss in laser energy.

The cell's brightness showed a peculiar tendency;\nspecifically, it did not extinguish even though the wavelength varied by more\nthan 5 pm. To reduce the impact of SPM, we developed an optical system that\ndivides one laser pulse into four lower-power pulses.

Different forms of continuous central moments of sources,\nincluding one that is obtained from a local Maxwellian, are considered in this\nregard.

The method of central moments along with\nthe associated orthogonal properties of the moment basis completely determines\nthe expressions for the source terms as a function of the force and macroscopic\nvelocity fields. In contrast to the existing forcing schemes, it is found that\nthey involve higher order terms in velocity space.

Although the IBM approach has been quite insightful, the\ncapability to follow each individual usually comes at the expense of analytical\ntractability, which limits the generality of the statements that can be made.\nFor the specific case of spatial structure in populations of sessile (and\nidentical) organisms, space-time point processes with local regulation seem to\ncover the middle ground between analytical tractability and a higher degree of\nbiological realism. Continuum approximations of these stochastic processes\ndistill their fundamental properties, but they often result in infinite\nhierarchies of moment equations. We use the principle of constrained maximum\nentropy to derive a closure relationship for one such hierarchy truncated at\nsecond order using normalization and the product densities of first and second\norders as constraints. The resulting `maxent' closure is similar to the\nKirkwood superposition approximation, but it is complemented with previously\nunknown correction terms that depend on on the area for which third order\ncorrelations are irreducible. This region also serves as a validation check,\nsince it can only be found if the assumptions of the closure are met.\nComparisons between simulations of the point process, alternative heuristic\nclosures, and the maxent closure show significant improvements in the ability\nof the maxent closure to predict equilibrium values for mildly aggregated\nspatial patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 23:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-29"}

Our focus is\non the Lidov-Kozai mechanism and the evolution of planetesimal eccentricity and\ninclination. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that, on one\nhand, the disk gravity generally narrows down the Kozai-on region, i.e., the\nLidov-Kozai effect can be suppressed in certain parts of (or even the whole of)\nthe disk, depending on various parameters. In the Kozai-off region,\nplanetesimals would move on orbits close to the mid-plane of gas-disk, with the\nrelative angle ($i^{'}$) following a small amplitude periodical oscillation. On\nthe other hand, when we include the effects of disk gravity, we find that the\nLidov-Kozai effect can operate even at arbitrarily low inclinations ($i_B$),\nalthough lower $i_B$ leads to a smaller Kozai-on region. Furthermore, in the\nKozai-on region, most planetesimals' eccentricities can be excited to extremely\nhigh values ($\\sim 1$), and such extreme high eccentricities usually accompany\norbital flipping, i.e., planetesimal orbit flips back and forth between\nanterograde and retrograde. Once a planetesimal reaches very high orbital\neccentricity, gas drag damping will shrink the planetesimal orbit, forming a\n\"hot planetesimal\" on a near circular orbit very close to the primary star.\nSuch a mechanism, if replacing the planetesimals and gas drag damping with\nJupiters and tidal damping respectively, may lead to frequent production of\nhot-Jupiters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 01:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

For systems with either a single\norbital or degenerate multiple orbitals, the U(1) and $Z_2$ slave-spin\napproachs yield the same results in the slave-spin-condensed phase.

The nature of the Mott insulating state is influenced by the\ninterplay between the Hund's rule coupling and crystal field splittings.

Therefore, monobit receivers for BPSK\nhave been proposed to address this problem. In this work, QPSK modulation is\nconsidered for higher data rate. First, the optimal receiver based on monobit\nADC with Nyquist sampling is derived, and its corresponding performance in the\nform of deflection ratio is calculated. Then a suboptimal but more practical\nmonobit receiver is obtained, along with iterative demodulation and small\nsample removal. The effect of the imbalances between the In-phase (I) and\nQuadrature-phase (Q) branches, including the amplitude and phase imbalances, is\ncarefully investigated too. To combat the performance loss caused by IQ\nimbalances, monobit receivers based on double training sequences are proposed.\nNumerical simulations show that the low-complexity suboptimal receiver suffers\nonly 3dB signal to noise ratio (SNR) loss in AWGN channels and 1dB SNR loss in\nmultipath static channels compared with the matched filter based monobit\nreceiver with full channel state information (CSI). The impact of the phase\ndifference between the transmitter and receiver is presented. It is observed\nthat the performance degradation caused by the amplitude imbalance is\nnegligible.

In the XY phase, the string correlations decay within\na relatively very large lattice distance, which makes a finite-size study\ndifficult to verify the non-existence of the string order. Thus, in the Haldane\nphase, the non-vanishing string correlations in the limit of a very large\ndistance allow to characterize the phase boundaries to the XY phase and the\nNeel phase, which implies that the transverse long-range string order is the\norder parameter for the Haldane phase.

The estimated critical points including a BKT transition from\nthe XY phase to the Haldane phase agree well with the previous results:\n$\\Delta_{c2} = 0$ for the XY-Haldane phase transition and $\\Delta_{c3} = 1.185$\nfor the Haldane-N'eel phase transition from the density renormalization group.\nFrom a finite-entanglement scaling of the von Neumann entropy with respect to\nthe truncation dimension, the central charges are found to be $c \\simeq 1.0$ at\n$\\Delta_{c2} = 0$ and $c \\simeq 0.5$ at $\\Delta_{c3} = 1.185$, respectively,\nwhich shows that the XY-Haldane phase transition at $\\Delta_{c2} = 0$ belongs\nto the Heisenberg universality class, while the Haldane-Neel phase transition\nat $\\Delta_{c2} = 1.185$ belongs to the two-dimensional classical Ising\nuniversality class. It is also shown that, the long-range order parameters and\nthe von Neumann entropy, as well as the fidelity per site approach, can be\napplied to characterize quantum phase transitions as a universal phase\ntransition indicator for one-dimensional lattice many-body systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 08:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In a series of\npapers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete\nmathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and\nrigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing\nintelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the\nphilosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of\nrational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric.\nRecently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally\ninvestigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough\nhas resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique\nthat UAI is only a theory.

To reach\nthe site of fertilization, sperm must traverse narrow and convoluted channels,\nfilled with viscous fluids. To elucidate individual and group behaviors that\nmay occur in the complex three-dimensional female tract environment, we examine\nthe behavior of migrating sperm in assorted micro-channel geometries. Cells\nrarely swim in the central part of the channel cross-section, instead traveling\nalong the intersection of the channel walls (`channel corners'). When the\nchannel turns sharply, cells leave the corner, continuing ahead until hitting\nthe opposite wall of the channel, with a distribution of departure angles, the\nlatter being modulated by fluid viscosity. If the channel bend is smooth, cells\ndepart from the inner wall when the curvature radius is less than a threshold\nvalue close to 150 micron. Specific wall shapes are able to preferentially\ndirect motile cells. As a consequence of swimming along the corners, the domain\noccupied by cells becomes essentially 1-dimensional. This leads to frequent\ncollisions and needs to be accounted for when modeling the behavior of\npopulations of migratory cells and considering how sperm populate and navigate\nthe female tract.

Moreover, in\ncontrast to the GR situation, the gauge theory Lagrangian is convex. We then\nproceed with a formulation of the full non-linear theory. The equivalence to\nthe metric-based GR holds only at the level of solutions of the field\nequations, that is, on-shell. The gauge-theoretic approach also makes it clear\nthat GR is not the only interacting theory of massless spin two particles, in\nspite of the GR uniqueness theorems available in the metric description. Thus,\nthere is an inifnite-parameter class of gravity theories all describing just\ntwo propagating polarisations of the graviton. We describe how matter can be\ncoupled to gravity in this formulation and, in particular, how both the gravity\nand Yang-Mills arise as sectors of a general diffeomorphism invariant gauge\ntheory.

A significant number of\ntransiting exoplanets have now been discovered for which the mass, radius,\nsemi-major axis, host star metallicity and stellar effective temperature are\nknown. We use multivariate regression models to determine the dependence of\nplanetary radius on planetary equilibrium temperature T_eq, planetary mass M_p,\nstellar metallicity [Fe/H], orbital semi-major axis a, and tidal heating rate\nH_tidal, for 119 transiting planets in three distinct mass regimes. We\ndetermine that heating leads to larger planet radii, as expected, increasing\nmass leads to increased or decreased radii of low-mass (<0.5R_J) and high-mass\n(>2.0R_J) planets, respectively (with no mass effect on Jupiter-mass planets),\nand increased host-star metallicity leads to smaller planetary radii,\nindicating a relationship between host-star metallicity and planet heavy\nelement content. For Saturn-mass planets, a good fit to the radii may be\nobtained from log(R_p/R_J)=-0.077+0.450 log(M_p/M_J)-0.314[Fe/H]+0.671\nlog(a/AU)+0.398 log(T_eq/K).

As a demonstration, we apply this tool to a\nsample of hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HLIRGs). The Bayesian evidences\nobtained for a pure Starburst, a pure AGN, and a linear combination of\nStarburst+AGN models show that the Starburst+AGN model have the highest\nevidence for all galaxies in this sample. The Bayesian evidences for the three\nmodels and the estimated contributions of starburst and AGN to infrared\nluminosity show that HLIRGs can be classified into two groups: one dominated by\nstarburst and the other dominated by AGN. Other parameters and corresponding\nuncertainties about starburst and AGN are also estimated by using the model\nwith the highest Bayesian evidence. We found that the starburst region of the\nHLIRGs dominated by starburst tends to be more compact and has a higher\nfraction of OB star than that of HLIRGs dominated by AGN.

Customarily, the performance of drag reduction techniques in internal\nflows is evaluated under two alternative flow conditions, i.e. at constant mass\nflow rate or constant pressure gradient. Successful control leads to reduction\nof drag and pumping power within the former approach, whereas the latter leads\nto an increase of the mass flow rate and pumping power. In practical\napplications, however, money and time define the flow control challenge: a\ncompromise between the energy expenditure (money) and the corresponding\nconvenience (flow rate) achieved with that amount of energy has to be reached\nso as to accomplish a goal which in general depends on the specific\napplication.

With the radial velocities, we\ncomputed the orbital solution of the inner system, and we describe the main\nproperties of the orbit of the outer star such as the preliminary mass ratio,\nthe eccentricity, and the orbital-period range. With the individual spectra, we\ndetermined the stellar parameters of each star by means of the CMFGEN\natmosphere code. Results. We offer clear evidence that HD 150136 is a triple\nsystem composed of an O3V((f\\ast))-3.5V((f+)), an O5.5-6V((f)), and an\nO6.5-7V((f)) star. The three stars are between 0-3 Myr old. We derive dynamical\nmasses of about 64, 40, and 35 Msun for the primary, the secondary and the\nthird components by assuming an inclination of 49{\\deg}. It currently\ncorresponds to one of the most massive systems in our galaxy. The third star\nmoves with a period in the range of 2950 to 5500 d on an outer orbit with an\neccentricity of at least 0.3. This discovery makes HD 150136 the first\nconfirmed triple system with an O3 primary star. However, because of the long\norbital period, our dataset is not sufficient to constrain the orbital solution\nof the tertiary component with high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 13:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We compute a likelihood that each BOSS galaxy is a\nprogenitor of the Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) sample, targeted by SDSS-I/II up\nz ~ 0.5, by using the fossil record of LRGs and their inferred star-formation\nhistories, metallicity histories and dust content.

Here we focus on the\neffects of anharmonicity on the steady-state thermal conductance of a mono and\ndiatomic molecular junctions. We also study molecules being confined in a\ndouble-well potential. We find that when the molecules have a non-linear\non-site potential the low-temperature thermal conductance is dramatically\naffected by the strength of non-linearity, whereas for the diatomic molecule\nconnected by an anharmonic spring the strength of anharmonicity plays almost no\nrole in the low-temperature regime. In case of the molecules confined in a\ndouble-well potential we find that the height of the barrier greatly affects\nthe thermal conductance; once the molecules can feel the effect of the barrier\nwe observe negative differential thermal conductance at both high and low\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 15:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 08:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-28"}

The Weather\nResearch and Forecasting model was used in a downscale mode. The current\nliterature focuses the discussion on the adiabatic dynamics of atmospheric\nwakes. Changes in mountain height and consequently on its relation to the\natmospheric inversion layer should explain the shift in wake regimes: from a\n'strong-wake' to a 'weak-wake' scenario. Nevertheless, changes in SST\nvariability can also induce similar regime shifts. Increase in evaporation,\ncontributes to increase convection and thus to an uplift of the stratified\natmospheric layer, above the critical height, with subsequent internal gravity\nwave activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 21:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
