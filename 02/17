We formulate these two\narguments in such a way that each conclusion follows in first-order logic from\nthe corresponding assumptions. Our analysis shows that the conclusion which\nfollows for Aquinas is considerably weaker than what his aims demand. With\nformalizations that are logically valid in hand, we reinterpret the natural\nlanguage versions of the premises and conclusions in terms of concepts of\ncausality consistent with (and used in) recent work in cosmology done by\nphysicists. In brief: the Kalam argument commits the fallacy of equivocation in\na way that seems beyond repair; two of the premises adopted by Aquinas seem\ndubious when the terms `cause' and `causality' are interpreted in the context\nof contemporary empirical science. Thus, while there are no problems with\nwhether the conclusions follow logically from their assumptions, the Kalam\nargument is not viable, and the Aquinas argument does not imply a caused\norigination of the universe. The assumptions of the latter are at best less\nthan obvious relative to recent work in the sciences.

As a model problem for clustering, we consider the\ndensest k-disjoint-clique problem, whose goal is to identify the collection of\nk disjoint cliques of a given weighted complete graph maximizing the sum of the\ndensities of the complete subgraphs induced by these cliques. In this paper, we\nestablish conditions ensuring exact recovery of the densest k cliques of a\ngiven graph from the optimal solution of a particular semidefinite program. In\nparticular, the semidefinite relaxation is exact for input graphs corresponding\nto data consisting of k large, distinct clusters and a smaller number of\noutliers. This approach also yields a semidefinite relaxation for the\nbiclustering problem with similar recovery guarantees. Given a set of objects\nand a set of features exhibited by these objects, biclustering seeks to\nsimultaneously group the objects and features according to their expression\nlevels. This problem may be posed as partitioning the nodes of a weighted\nbipartite complete graph such that the sum of the densities of the resulting\nbipartite complete subgraphs is maximized.

In such limit the growth rates\nof the two instability types coincide for any power-type background angular\nvelocity radial profile with negative exponent corresponding to the value of\nthe Rossby number of the rotating shear flow. The MRI requirement for\ninstability is that the background angular velocity profile is a decreasing\nfunction of the distance from the centre of the disk which corresponds to the\nhorizontal rotational MEI requirement of negative Rossby numbers.

Previously\nobserved electron spectra at low energies are consistent with a fast Fermi\nmechanism, based on the adiabatic conservation of the magnetic moment ({\\mu})\nof the accelerated electrons. At higher energies, suprathermal power law tails\nare observed beyond the level predicted by fast Fermi. The SWEA and STE\nelectron detectors on STEREO enable measurements of foreshock electrons with\ngood energy resolution and sensitivity over the entire foreshock beam. We\ninvestigate the electron acceleration mechanism by comparing observed STEREO\nelectron spectra with predictions based on a Liouville mapping of upstream\nelectrons through a shock encounter. The foreshock electron beam extends up to\nseveral tens of keV, energies for which the Larmor radii of electrons is tens\nof km or greater.

In particular, we show that M(Q), the\nfinite signed Borel measures are asymptotically closed. This means that if the\ninitial condition is a finite signed Borel measure and if the asymptotic limit\nof the model solution exists, then it will be a measure (note that function\nspaces such as L1(Q) and C(Q) do not have this property). We also establish\npermanence results for the full replicator mutator model. Then, we study the\nasymptotic analysis in the case where there is more than one strategy of a\ngiven fitness (a continuum of strategies of a given fitness), a case that often\narises in applications. To study this case our mathematical structure must\ninclude the ability to demonstrate the convergence of the model solution to a\nmeasure supported on a continuum of strategies. For this purpose, we\ndemonstrate how to perform completions of the space of measures and how to use\nthese completions to formulate weak (generalized) asymptotic limits. In\nparticular, we show that for the pure replicator dynamics the (weak) solution\nof the dynamical system converges to a Dirac measure centered at the fittest\nstrategy class; thus this Dirac measure is a globally attractive equilibrium\npoint which is termed a continuously stable strategy (CSS). It is also shown\nthat in the discrete case of the pure replicator dynamics and even for small\nperturbation of the pure replicator dynamics (i.e., selection with small\nmutation) there exists a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 20:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-17"}

This may be understood through the sub-unity exponent found in\nthe scaling relation we derive between the BCG mass and cluster mass over the\nhalo mass range 10^13 < M500 < 10^15Msol and the lack of correlation between\nradio luminosity and cluster mass, such that BCG AGN in groups can have\nrelatively more energetic influence on the ICM. The Lx - Tx relation for\nsystems with the most massive BCGs, or those with BCGs co-located with the peak\nof the ICM emission, is steeper than that for those with the least massive and\nmost offset, which instead follows self-similarity. This is evidence that a\ncombination of central gas cooling and powerful, well fuelled AGN causes the\ndeparture of the ICM from pure gravitational heating, with the steepened\nrelation crossing self-similarity at Tx = 2 keV. Importantly, regardless of\ntheir black hole mass, BCGs are more likely to host radio-loud AGN if they are\nin a massive cluster (Tx > 2 keV) and again co-located with an effective fuel\nsupply of dense, cooling gas.

In this paper, we search for C absorption features in 188\noptical spectra of 144 low-redshift (z < 0.1) SNe Ia with ages <3.6 d after\nmaximum brightness. These data were obtained as part of the Berkeley SN Ia\nProgram (BSNIP; Silverman et al. 2012) and represent the largest set of SNe Ia\nin which C has ever been searched. We find that ~11 per cent of the SNe studied\nshow definite C absorption features while ~25 per cent show some evidence for C\nII in their spectra. Also, if one obtains a spectrum at t < -5 d, then there is\na better than 30 per cent chance of detecting a distinct absorption feature\nfrom C II. SNe Ia that show C are found to resemble those without C in many\nrespects, but objects with C tend to have bluer optical colours than those\nwithout C.

Neutrino flavour oscillation is nowadays a fairly\nwell-established experimental fact. However, the formulation of flavour\noscillations in a relativistic field theoretical framework presents non-trivial\ndifficulties. A nonperturbative approach for building flavour states has been\nproposed by Blasone, Vitiello and coworkers. The formalism implies a\nnon-trivial physical vacuum (called \"flavour vacuum\"), which might act as a\nsource of Dark Energy. Furthermore, such a vacuum has been recognized as the\neffective vacuum state arising in the low energy limit of a string theoretical\nmodel, D-particle Foam Model. In the attempt of probing the observable\nphenomenology of the D-particle foam model, a simple toy model (two scalars\nwith mixing \\`a la Blasone & Vitiello on a adiabatically expanding background)\nhas been studied, proving that the flavour vacuum might behave as Dark Energy\nunder certain assumptions. The first work presented in this thesis represents a\ndevelopment of this approach. A more realistic model is considered, which\nincludes two flavoured Dirac fermions on a generic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nuniverse. In this framework we show that the flavour vacuum presents different\nfeatures, which are incompatible with Dark Energy. Motivated by this\ndiscrepancy, we next embark on the analysis of a simple supersymmetric model in\nflat spacetime (free Wess-Zumino), proving that the bosonic component of\nflavour vacuum acts as Dark Energy, whereas the fermionic as a source of Dark\nMatter. Finally we develop a new method of calculation that open the way to a\nnonperturbative extension of these results for interactive theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 22:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

This improvement\nin resolution can potentially improve the photometry of faint stars in\nextremely crowded fields significantly by alleviating crowding. Alleviating\ncrowding is a prerequisite for observing gravitational microlensing in main\nsequence stars towards the galactic bulge. However, the photometric stability\nof this device has not been assessed. The EMCCD has sources of noise not found\nin conventional CCDs, and new methods for handling these must be developed.\n  We aim to investigate how the normal photometric reduction steps from\nconventional CCDs should be adjusted to be applicable to EMCCD data. One\ncomplication is that a bias frame cannot be obtained conventionally, as the\noutput from an EMCCD is not normally distributed. Also, the readout process\ngenerates spurious charges in any CCD, but in EMCCD data, these charges are\nvisible as opposed to the conventional CCD. Furthermore we aim to eliminate the\nphoton waste associated with lucky imaging by combining this method with\nshift-and-add.\n  A simple probabilistic model for the dark output of an EMCCD is developed.\nFitting this model with the expectation-maximization algorithm allows us to\nestimate the bias, readout noise, amplification, and spurious charge rate per\npixel and thus correct for these phenomena. To investigate the stability of the\nphotometry, corrected frames of a crowded field are reduced with a PSF fitting\nphotometry package, where a lucky image is used as a reference.\n  We find that it is possible to develop an algorithm that elegantly reduces\nEMCCD data and produces stable photometry at the 1% level in an extremely\ncrowded field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 22:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2012 11:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-06"}

Specifically, we\ntreat the intermediate relay as an eavesdropper from which the information\ntransmitted by the sources needs to be kept secret, despite the fact that its\ncooperation in relaying this information is essential. We indicate that a\nnon-zero secrecy rate is indeed achievable in this two-way relay network even\nwithout external friendly jammers. As for the system with friendly jammers,\nafter further analysis, we can obtain that the secrecy rate of the sources can\nbe effectively improved by utilizing proper jamming power from the friendly\njammers. Then, we formulate a Stackelberg game model between the sources and\nthe friendly jammers as a power control scheme to achieve the optimized secrecy\nrate of the sources, in which the sources are treated as the sole buyer and the\nfriendly jammers are the sellers. In addition, the optimal solutions of the\njamming power and the asking prices are given and a distributed updating\nalgorithm to obtain the Stakelberg equilibrium is provided for the proposed\ngame. Finally, the simulations results verify the properties and the efficiency\nof the proposed Stackelberg game based scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 00:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Ultimately, constraining spatial and temporal properties of an\nexoplanet atmosphere will provide further insight into its physics. For\ntidally-locked hot Jupiters that transit and are eclipsed by their host star,\nthe first steps are now possible.\n  Our aim is to constrain an exoplanet's shape, brightness distribution (BD)\nand system parameters from its light curve. Notably, we rely on the eclipse\nscanning.\n  We use archived Spitzer 8-{\\mu}m data of HD189733 (6 transits, 8 secondary\neclipses, and a phase curve) in a global MCMC procedure for mitigating\nsystematics. We also include HD189733's out-of-transit radial velocity\nmeasurements.\n  We find a 6-{\\sigma} deviation from the expected occultation of a\nuniformly-bright disk. This deviation emerges mainly from HD189733b's thermal\npattern, not from its shape. We indicate that the correlation of the orbital\neccentricity, e, and BD (uniform time offset) does also depend on the stellar\ndensity, \\rho*, and the impact parameter, b (e-b-\\rho*-BD correlation). For\nHD189733b, we find that relaxing the e-constraint and using more complex BDs\nlead to lower stellar/planetary densities and a more localized and\nlatitudinally-shifted hot spot. We obtain an improved constraint on the upper\nlimit of HD189733b's orbital eccentricity, e<0.011 (95%), when including the RV\nmeasurements.\n  Our study provides new insights into the analysis of exoplanet light curves\nand a proper framework for future eclipse-scanning observations. Observations\nof the same exoplanet at different wavelengths will improve the constraints on\nits system parameters while ultimately yielding a large-scale time-dependent 3D\nmap of its atmosphere.

We\nstarted our study by building a formalism based on the hidden local symmetry\nand calculating the leading order contributions to the scattering equations by\nsumming the diagrams with: (a) a vector meson exchange in the t-channel (b) an\noctet baryon exchange in the s-, u-channels and (c) a contact interaction\narising from the part of the vector meson-baryon Lagrangian which is related to\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the baryons. We find the contribution from all\nthese sources, except the s-channel, to be important. The amplitudes obtained\nby solving the coupled channel Bethe-Salpeter equations for the systems with\ntotal strangeness zero, show generation of one isospin 3/2, spin 1/2 resonance\nand three isospin 1/2 resonances: two with spin 3/2 and one with spin 1/2. We\nidentify these resonances with $\\Delta$ (1900) $S_{31}$, $N^*$(2080) $D_{13}$,\n$N^*$(1700) $D_{13}$, and $N^*$(2090) $S_{11}$, respectively.\n  We have further extended our study by including pseudoscalar meson-baryon\n(PB) as the coupled channels of VB systems. For this, we obtain the PB\n$\\rightarrow$ VB amplitudes by using the Kroll-Ruddermann term where,\nconsidering the vector meson dominance phenomena, the photon is replaced by a\nvector meson. The calculations done within this formalism reveal a very strong\ncoupling of the VB channels to the low-lying resonances like $\\Lambda$(1405)\nand $\\Lambda$(1670), which can have important implications on certain reactions\nproducing them. In addition to this, we find that the effect of coupling the\nhigher mass states to the lighter channels is not restricted to increasing the\nwidth of those states, it can be far more strong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 05:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Some physicists concentrate\non the system in pure classical envi- ronment, while others study the system in\npure quantized environment. So a natural question is asked: how about an\ninteracting system in composite environments made up of both classical and\nquantized field. In this letter, we analyze a quantum system composed of two\ninteracting spins, of which one is in classical magnetic field and the other is\nin quantized field. First, classical magnetic field driven Berry phases for the\nwhole system and subsystem are studied. The effect of couplings between\nparticles and photon on these phases are analyzed. In comparison with the\ndynamical quantized field, We find that even a static quantized field in its\nvacuum state can also have an effect on Berry phase. Second, quantized field\ndriven Berry phases for the whole system and sub- system are formulated,\nincluding both one and two mode of this field. The vacuum induced effects are\nelaborated, moreover compared with the constant vacuum induced phases in former\npapers, the counterpart in this letter varies according to classical magnetic\nfield, couplings and other pa- rameters. For the two mode quantized field, the\nrigorous relationship between the concurrence and Berry phase for subsystem are\nbuilt up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 07:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

The same sparse matrix is multiplied by a\ndense vector repeatedly in these solvers. Matrices with irregular sparsity\npatterns make it difficult to utilize cache locality effectively in SpMxV\ncomputations. In this work, we investigate single- and multiple-SpMxV\nframeworks for exploiting cache locality in SpMxV computations. For the\nsingle-SpMxV framework, we propose two cache-size-aware top-down\nrow/column-reordering methods based on 1D and 2D sparse matrix partitioning by\nutilizing the column-net and enhancing the row-column-net hypergraph models of\nsparse matrices. The multiple-SpMxV framework depends on splitting a given\nmatrix into a sum of multiple nonzero-disjoint matrices so that the SpMxV\noperation is performed as a sequence of multiple input- and output- dependent\nSpMxV operations. For an effective matrix splitting required in this framework,\nwe propose a cache- size-aware top-down approach based on 2D sparse matrix\npartitioning by utilizing the row-column-net hypergraph model. For this\nframework, we also propose two methods for effective ordering of individual\nSpMxV operations. The primary objective in all of the three methods is to\nmaximize the exploitation of temporal locality.

These experiments unveil the elementary mechanisms coupling\nthe electrons' temperature to their spin order. Even though first quantitative\nmodels describing ultrafast demagnetization have just been published within the\npast year, new calculations also suggest alternative mechanisms.\nSimultaneously, the application of fast demagnetization experiments has been\ndemonstrated to provide key insight into technologically important systems such\nas high spin polarization metals, and consequently there is broad interest in\nfurther understanding the physics of these phenomena. To gain new and relevant\ninsights, we perform ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments to characterize\nthe demagnetization processes of highly spin-polarized magnetic thin films on a\nfemtosecond time scale. Previous studies have suggested shifting the Fermi\nenergy into the center of the gap by tuning the number of electrons and thereby\nto study its influence on spin-flip processes. Here we show that choosing\nisoelectronic Heusler compounds (Co2MnSi, Co2MnGe and Co2FeAl) allows us to\nvary the degree of spin polarization between 60% and 86%. We explain this\nbehavior by considering the robustness of the gap against structural disorder.\nMoreover, we observe that Co-Fe-based pseudo gap materials, such as partially\nordered Co-Fe-Ge alloys and also the well-known Co-Fe-B alloys, can reach\nsimilar values of the spin polarization. By using the unique features of these\nmetals we vary the number of possible spin-flip channels, which allows us to\npinpoint and control the half metals electronic structure and its influence\nonto the elementary mechanisms of ultrafast demagnetization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 10:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

Electric field in the active plasma\nvolume is determined applying the measured spectrum, well-known Frank-Condon\nfactors for nitrogen transitions and numerically- simulated electron\ndistribution functions. The measured electric current density is used for\ndetermination of electron density in plasma. Using the determined plasma\nparameters, the dissociation rate of nitrogen and oxygen in active plasma\nvolume are calculated, which can be used by simulation of the chemical\nkinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 11:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

With a\nsmall number of adjustable parameters, the Landau theory gives an excellent fit\nto all three transition lines, as well as the magnetic and the ferroelectric\norder parameters. The fit of the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters is\nfurther improved by including the effect of fluctuations near the transitions.\nWe demonstrate the highly frustrated nature of these materials and suggest a\nsimple explanation for the dramatic effects of doping with different magnetic\nions at the Mn sites.

The construction\nrelies on certain orthogonality and triangularity relations. Although many\nsuperpolynomials were constructed as solutions of highly over-determined\nsystem, the existence issue was left open. This is resolved here: we\ndemonstrate that the underlying construction has a (unique) solution. The proof\nuses, as a starting point, the definition of the Macdonald superpolynomials in\nterms of the Macdonald non-symmetric polynomials via a non-standard\n(anti)symmetrization and a suitable dressing by anticommuting monomials. This\nrelationship naturally suggests the form of two family of commuting operators\nthat have the defined superpolynomials as their common eigenfunctions. These\neigenfunctions are then shown to be triangular and orthogonal. Up to a\nnormalization, these two conditions uniquely characterize these\nsuperpolynomials. Moreover, the Macdonald superpolynomials are found to be\northogonal with respect to a second (constant-term-type) scalar product and its\nnorm is evaluated. The latter is shown to match (up to a q-power) the\nconjectured norm with respect to the original scalar product. Finally, we\nrecall the super-version of the Macdonald positivity conjecture and present two\nnew conjectures which both provide a remarkable relationship between the new\n(q,t)-Kostka coefficients and the usual ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 14:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 00:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}

These innovations\ninclude (1) an indicator based on counting a university's highly cited\npublications, (2) indicators based on fractional rather than full counting of\ncollaborative publications, (3) the possibility of excluding non-English\nlanguage publications, and (4) the use of stability intervals. Finally, some\ncomments are made on the interpretation of the ranking, and a number of\nlimitations of the ranking are pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 15:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

In this limit bound states\n(trions) of the three components are formed. We derive an effective Hamiltonian\nfor these composite fermions and show that it is asymptotically equivalent to\nan antiferromagnetic Ising model. By using Monte-Carlo simulations, we\ninvestigate the spatial arrangement of the trions and the formation of a\ntrionic density wave (CDW), both in a homogeneous lattice and in the presence\nof an additional harmonic confinement. Depending on the strength of the\nconfinement and on the temperature, we found several scenarios for the trionic\ndistribution, including coexistence of disordered trions with CDW and band\ninsulator phases. Our results show that, due to a proximity effect, staggered\ndensity modulations are induced in regions of the trap where they would not\notherwise be present according to the local density approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 23:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 09:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}
