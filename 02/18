The aim of this\nreport is to inform the BW project about MTC, including understanding aspects\nof MTC applications that can be used to characterize the domain and\nunderstanding the implications of these aspects to middleware and policies.\nMany MTC applications do not neatly fit the stereotypes of high-performance\ncomputing (HPC) or high-throughput computing (HTC) applications. Like HTC\napplications, by definition MTC applications are structured as graphs of\ndiscrete tasks, with explicit input and output dependencies forming the graph\nedges. However, MTC applications have significant features that distinguish\nthem from typical HTC applications. In particular, different engineering\nconstraints for hardware and software must be met in order to support these\napplications. HTC applications have traditionally run on platforms such as\ngrids and clusters, through either workflow systems or parallel programming\nsystems. MTC applications, in contrast, will often demand a short time to\nsolution, may be communication intensive or data intensive, and may comprise\nvery short tasks. Therefore, hardware and software for MTC must be engineered\nto support the additional communication and I/O and must minimize task dispatch\noverheads. The hardware of large-scale HPC systems, with its high degree of\nparallelism and support for intensive communication, is well suited for MTC\napplications. However, HPC systems often lack a dynamic resource-provisioning\nfeature, are not ideal for task communication via the file system, and have an\nI/O system that is not optimized for MTC-style applications. Hence, additional\nsoftware support is likely to be required to gain full benefit from the HPC\nhardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 16:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

Previously we have found all rational solutions of the\n2-dimensional projective translation equation, or PrTE,\n(1-z)f(X)=f(f(Xz)(1-z)/z); here f(X)=(u(x,y),v(x,y)) is a pair of two (real or\ncomplex) functions. Solutions of this functional equation are called projective\nflows. A vector field of a rational flow is a pair of 2-homogenic rational\nfunctions. On the other hand, only special pairs of 2-homogenic rational\nfunctions give rise to rational flows. In this paper we are interested in all\nnon-singular (satisfying the boundary condition) and unramified (without\nbranching points, i.e. single-valued functions in C^2\\{union of curves})\nprojective flows whose vector field is still rational. We prove that, up to\nconjugation with 1-homogenic birational plane transformation, these are of 6\ntypes: 1) the identity flow; 2) one flow for each non-negative integer N -\nthese flows are rational of level N; 3) the level 1 exponential flow, which is\nalso conjugate to the level 1 tangent flow; 4) the level 3 flow expressable in\nterms of Dixonian (equianharmonic) elliptic functions; 5) the level 4 flow\nexpressable in terms of lemniscatic elliptic functions; 6) the level 6 flow\nexpressable in terms of Dixonian elliptic functions again.

An extensive radio to X-ray\nmulti-wavelength campaign was immediately triggered, and we report here on\nESO/FORS2+ISAAC optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations, supported\nby ATCA radio and RXTE/Swift X-ray quasi-simultaneous data. GX 339-4 was\nobserved at three different epochs, once in the soft state and twice in the\nhard state. In the soft state, the optical and near-infrared continuum is\nlargely consistent with the Raleigh-Jeans tail of a thermal process. As an\nexplanation, we favour irradiation of the outer accretion disc by its inner\nregions, enhanced by disc warping. An excess is also present at low\nfrequencies, likely due to a M subgiant companion star. During the first hard\nstate, the optical/near-infrared continuum is well-described by the optically\nthin synchrotron emission of the compact jet combined with disc irradiation and\nperhaps another component peaking in the ultraviolet. The spectral break where\nthe jet transits from the optically thick to thin regimes, located below\n1.20e14 Hz, is not detected and the extension of the optically thin synchrotron\nis consistent with the 3-50 keV spectrum. In contrast, the emission during the\nsecond hard state is more difficult to understand and points toward a more\ncomplex jet continuum. In both cases, the near-infrared continuum is found to\nbe variable at timescales at least as short as 20 s, although these\nvariabilities are smoothed out beyond a few hundred seconds. This implies rapid\nvariations - in flux and frequency - of the location of the spectral break,\ni.e. dramatic short timescale changes of the physical conditions at the base of\nthe jet, such as the magnetic field and/or the base radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 18:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The resulting final kinetic energy and nickel-56 yields\nconform better to observational values than is the case for the \"classical\" GCD\nmodels. In the present class of models, the ignition of a deflagration phase\nleads to a rising, burning plume of ash. The ash breaks out of the surface of\nthe white dwarf, flows laterally around the star, and converges on the\ncollision region at the antipodal point from where it broke out. The amount of\nenergy released during the deflagration phase is enough to cause the star to\nrapidly expand, so that when the ash reaches the antipodal point, the surface\ndensity is too low to initiate a detonation. Instead, as the ash flows into the\ncollision region (while mixing with surface fuel), the star reaches its\nmaximally expanded state and then contracts. The stellar contraction acts to\nincrease the density of the star, including the density in the collision\nregion. This both raises the temperature and density of the fuel-ash mixture in\nthe collision region and ultimately leads to thermodynamic conditions that are\nnecessary for the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism to produce a detonation.

A\nmeasurement of the BAO scale is more sensitive to regions with long wavelength\noverdensities than underdensities, because (due to non-linear growth and bias)\nthese overdense regions contain larger fluctuations and more tracers and hence\ncontribute more to the total correlation function. In overdense regions the BAO\nscale shrinks because such regions locally behave as positively curved closed\nuniverses, and hence a smaller scale than predicted by linear theory is\nmeasured in the total correlation function. Other effects which also contribute\nto the shift are briefly discussed. We provide approximate analytic expressions\nfor the non-linear shift including a brief discussion of biased tracers and\nexplain why reconstruction should entirely reverse the shift.

However, loops typically comprise only a minority of the total\nemission in active regions. Is this cooling pattern a common property of active\nregion coronal plasma, or does it only occur in unique circumstances,\nlocations, and times? The new SDO/AIA data provide a wonderful opportunity to\nanswer this question systematically for an entire active region. We measure the\ntime lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV channels using 24 hours of images of AR\n11082 observed on 19 June 2010.

They are\nthe most significant drivers of adverse space weather at Earth and other\nlocations in the heliosphere, so it is important to understand the physics\ngoverning their eruption and propagation. However the diffuse morphology and\ntransient nature of CMEs makes them difficult to identify and track using\ntraditional image processing techniques. In this thesis the implementation of\nmultiscale image processing techniques to identify and track the CME front\nthrough coronagraph images is detailed. An ellipse characterisation of the CME\nfront is used to determine the CME kinematics and morphology with increased\nprecision as compared to techniques used in current CME catalogues, and efforts\nare underway to automate this procedure for applying to a large number of CME\nobservations for future analysis. It was found that CMEs do not simply undergo\nconstant acceleration, but rather tend to show a higher acceleration early in\ntheir propagation. The angular width of CMEs was also found to change as they\npropagate, normally increasing with height from the Sun. However these results\nwere derived from plane-of-sky measurements with no correction for how the true\nCME geometry and direction affect the kinematics and morphology observed. With\nthe advent of the unique dual perspectives of the STEREO spacecraft, the\nmultiscale methods were extended to an elliptical tie-pointing technique in\norder reconstruct the front of a CME in three-dimensions. Applying this\ntechnique to the Earth-directed CME of 12 December 2008 allowed an accurate\ndetermination of its true kinematics and morphology, and the CME was found to\nundergo early acceleration, non-radial motion, angular width expansion, and\naerodynamic drag in the solar wind as it propagated towards Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2012 20:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-20"}

The chromophilic $Z'$ couples only to two gluons,\nbut its two-body decays are absent, leading to a dominant decay mode of\n$Z'\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}g$. The unusual nature of the interaction predicts a\ncross-section which grows with $m_{Z'}$ for a fixed coupling and an\naccompanying gluon with a coupling that rises with its energy.

The first protocol\npresented in Ref[Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 120401] shows that the nonlocality of\nbipartite binary-input and binary-output nonsignaling correlated boxes could be\namplified by 'wiring' two copies of weaker-nonlocality boxes. Several optimized\ndistillation protocols were presented later for bipartite binary-input and\nbinary-output nonsignaling correlated boxes. In this paper, we focus on the\nbipartite binary-input and multi-nary-output nonsignaling correlated\nboxes---high-dimensional boxes, and design comparators-based protocols to\nachieve the distillation of high-dimensional nonlocality. The results show that\nthe high-dimensional nonlocality can be distilled in different ways, and we\nfind that the efficiencies of the protocols are influenced not only by the\nwirings but also by the classes the initial nonlocality boxes belongs to. Here,\nthe initial nonlcalities may have the same violation of the high-dimensional\nBell-type inequality, but they can fall into different classes, which shows\nthat the value of the violation of the high-dimensional Bell-type inequality is\nnot the only representation of nonlocality, and the combination manner(classes)\nin the expression of the correlated boxes is another important nonlocal\nrepresentation too. The current protocols are compatible with the previous\ntwo-dimensional nonlocality distillation protocols, but our protocols are more\npowerful and universal than previous ones in the sense that the current\nprotocols can be applied to the system with any dimension rather than the only\ntwo-dimension system in the previous protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2012 03:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

In bin packing games, an item has a\npositive weight, and given a valid packing or partition of the items, each item\nhas a cost or a payoff associated with it. We study a class of bin packing\ngames where the payoff of an item is the ratio between its weight and the total\nweight of items packed with it, that is, the cost sharing is based linearly on\nthe weights of items. We study several types of pure Nash equilibria: standard\nNash equilibria, strong equilibria, strictly Pareto optimal equilibria, and\nweakly Pareto optimal equilibria. We show that any game of this class admits\nall these types of equilibria. We study the (asymptotic) prices of anarchy and\nstability (PoA and PoS) of the problem with respect to these four types of\nequilibria, for the two cases of general weights and of unit weights.

For a standard model Higgs boson in the mass range of\n110-145 GeV upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the production cross\nsection are determined. We exclude a Higgs boson with m(H) = 115 GeV with a\nproduction cross section 3.2 times of that predicted by the standard model. In\nthe MSSM, upper limits on the neutral Higgs boson production cross section\ntimes branching fraction to tau pairs, as a function of the pseudoscalar Higgs\nboson mass, m(A), sets stringent new bounds in the parameter space, excluding\nat 95% CL values of tan(beta) as low as 7.1 at m(A) = 160 GeV in the m[h](max)\nbenchmark scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2012 15:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 22:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}
