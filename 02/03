During both observations the source was clearly\ndetected. Although the errors on the estimated fluxes are large, the source\nappears to be brighter by several tens of percents during the February 2007\nobservation compared to the August 2006 observation. During both observations\nthe 2-10 keV luminosity of the source was close to ~10^{33} erg/s for an\nassumed distance of 10 kpc. However, we note that the distance to this source\nis not well constrained and it has been suggested it might be as far as 35 kpc\nwhich would result in an order of magnitude higher luminosities. If the\nempirically found relation between the orbital period and the quiescence\nluminosity of black hole transients is also valid for IGR J17091-3624, then we\ncan estimate an orbital period of >100 hours (>4 days) for a distance of 10 kpc\nbut it could be as large as tens of days if the source is truly much further\naway. Such a large orbital period would be similar to GRS 1915+105 which has an\norbital period of ~34 days. Orbital periods this large could possibly be\nconnected to the fact that both sources exhibit the same very violent and\nextreme rapid X-ray variability which has so far not yet been seen from any\nother black hole system. Alternatively the orbital period of IGR J17091-3624\nmight be more in line with the other systems (<100 hours) but we happened to\nhave observed the source in an episode of elevated accretion which was\nsignificantly higher than its true quiescent accretion rate. In that case, the\nabsence or presence of extreme short-term variability properties as is seen for\nIGR J17091-3624 and GRS 1915+105 is not related to the orbital periods of these\nblack hole systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 17:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Information about such cross-correlation may be lost\nwhen single-variable reduced models, for $X_1$, are considered. Two different\nprocedures are typically applied: (a) one totally ignores the coupling with\n$X_2$; (b) one models the effect of $X_2$ as an average memory effect,\nobtaining a generalized Langevin equation. In case (a) discrepancies between\nthe system and the model appear both in entropy production and linear response;\nthe latter can be exploited to define effective temperatures, but those are\nmeaningful only when time-scales are well separated. In case (b) linear\nresponse of the model well reproduces that of the system; however the loss of\ninformation is reflected in a loss of entropy production. When only linear\nforces are present, such a reduction is dramatic and makes the average entropy\nproduction vanish, posing problems in interpreting FDT violations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 18:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The surface brightness\ndistribution of the stellar disks is calculated using 3D LTE spectrum formation\nand opacity sampling. We test our predictions using least-squares fits of model\nlight curves to primary eclipses that were observed with the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST).\n  The limb darkening law derived from the 3D model of HD 209458 between 2900 A\nand 5700 A produces significantly better fits to the HST data, removing\nsystematic residuals that were previously observed for model light curves based\non 1D predictions. This difference arises mainly from the shallower mean\ntemperature structure of the 3D model, which is a consequence of the explicit\nsimulation of surface granulation. In the case of HD 189733, the model\natmospheres produce practically equivalent limb darkening curves between 2900 A\nand 5700 A, partly due to obstruction by spectral lines, and the data are not\nsufficient to distinguish between the light curves. We also analyze HST\nobservations between 5350 A and 10500 A for this star; the 3D model leads to a\nbetter fit compared to 1D predictions.\n  The significant improvement of fit quality for the HD 209458 system\ndemonstrates the higher degree of realism of 3D models and the importance of\nsurface granulation for the formation of the atmospheric radiation field of\nlate-type stars. This result agrees well with recent investigations of limb\ndarkening in the solar continuum and other observational tests. The case of HD\n189733 is no contradiction as the model light curves are less sensitive to the\ntemperature stratification of the atmosphere and the observed data in the 2900\nA - 5700 A region are not sufficient to distinguish more clearly between 3D and\n1D limb darkening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 20:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Both the disc galaxy and the group are modelled as\nmulti-component, collision-less, N-body systems, composed by both dark matter\nand stars. In our simulations, the evolution of disc galaxies is followed as\ntheir orbits sink towards the group centre, under the effect of dynamical\nfriction. We explore a broad parameter space, covering several aspects of the\ngalaxy-group interaction that are potentially relevant to galaxy evolution.\nNamely, prograde and retrograde orbits, orbital eccentricities, disc\ninclination, role of a central bulge in discs, internal disc kinematics, and\ngalaxy-to-group mass ratios. We find that significant disc transformations\noccur only after the mean density of the group, measured within the orbit of\nthe galaxy, exceeds ~0.3-1 times the central mean density of the galaxy. The\nmorphological evolution of discs is found to be strongly dependent on the\ninitial inclination of the disc with respect to its orbital plane. That is,\ndiscs on face-on and retrograde orbits are shown to retain longer their disc\nstructures and kinematics, in comparison to prograde discs. This suggests that\nafter interacting with the global tidal field alone, a significant fraction of\ndisc galaxies should be found in the central regions of groups. Prominent\ncentral bulges are not produced, and pre-existing bulges are not enhanced in\ndiscs after the interaction with the group. Assuming that most S0 are formed in\ngroup environments, this implies that prominent bulges should be formed mostly\nby young stars, created only after a galaxy has been accreted by a group.\nFinally, contrary to some current implementations of tidal stripping in\nsemi-analytical models of galaxy evolution, we find that more massive galaxies\nsuffer more tidal stripping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In each of these scenarios, the\nuse of jet mass improves the estimated reach in gluino mass by 20 % to 50 %\nover current LHC searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 21:19:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 15:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 02:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-13"}

A good\nagreement is found with experimental measurements of the vortex density.\nBesides, by varying the turbulence intensity only, it is observed that the\ninter-vortex spacing varies with the Reynolds number as $Re^{-3/4}$, like the\nviscous length scale in classical turbulence. In the high temperature limit,\nKolmogorov's inertial cascade is recovered, as expected from previous numerical\nand experimental studies. As the temperature decreases, the inertial cascade\nremains present at large scales while, at small scales, the system evolves\ntowards a statistical equipartition of kinetic energy among spectral modes,\nwith a characteristic $k^2$ velocity spectrum. The accumulation of superfluid\nexcitations on a range of mesoscales enables the superfluid to keep dissipating\nkinetic energy through mutual friction with the residual normal fluid, although\nthe later becomes rare at low temperature. It is found that most of the\nsuperfluid vorticity can concentrate on these mesoscales at low temperature,\nwhile it is concentrated in the inertial range at higher temperature.

Murray & Rahman (2010) propose that the additional ionization is due\nto massive clusters (~ 7.5 x10^3 Msun for G49) embedded in the WMAP sources.\nSuch clusters should produce enough photons with energy \\geq 24.6 eV to fully\nionize helium in the DIR. Our observations rule out a simple model with G49\nionized by a massive cluster. We also considered 'leaky' HII region models for\nthe ionization of the DIR, suggested by Lockman and Anantharamaiah, but these\nmodels also cannot explain our observations. We estimate that the helium\nionizing photons need to be attenuated by > ~10 times to explain the\nobservations. If selective absorption of He- ionizing photons by dust is\ncausing this additional attenuation, then the ratio of dust absorption cross\nsections for He- and H- ionizing photons should be > ~6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 01:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The coupling with a library of numerical experiments of Ly-a\ntransfer through expanding or static dusty shells of gas allows us to derive\nthe Ly-a escape fractions and profiles. The predicted distribution of Ly-a\nphotons escape fraction shows that galaxies with a low star formation rate have\na f_esc of the order of unity, suggesting that, for those objects, Ly-a may be\nused to trace the star formation rate assuming a given conversion law. In\ngalaxies forming stars intensely, the escape fraction spans the whole range\nfrom 0 to 1. The model is able to get a good match to the UV and Ly-a\nluminosity function (LF) data at 3 < z < 5.

Second, if only energy\nlevels within the Kondo resonance are considered, the distributions of\nperturbed levels collapse to universal forms for both orthogonal and unitary\nensembles for all values of the coupling.

This method is\napplied to the interaction of molecules with intense, short-duration laser\npulses. The electronic response of the molecule is described using\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the resulting Kohn-Sham\nequations are solved numerically using finite difference techniques in\nconjunction with local and global adaptations of an underlying grid in\ncurvilinear coordinates. Using this approach, simulations can be carried out\nfor a wide range of molecules and both all-electron and pseudopotential\ncalculations are possible. The approach is applied to the study of high\nharmonic generation in N2 and benzene using linearly-polarized laser pulses\nand, to the best of our knowledge, the results for benzene represent the first\nTDDFT calculations of high harmonic generation in benzene using linearly\npolarized laser pulses. For N2 an enhancement of the cut-off harmonics is\nobserved whenever the laser polarization is aligned perpendicular to the\nmolecular axis. This enhancement is attributed to the symmetry properties of\nthe Kohn-Sham orbital that responds predominantly to the pulse. In benzene we\npredict that a suppression in the cut-off harmonics occurs whenever the laser\npolarization is aligned parallel to the molecular plane. We attribute this\nsuppression to the symmetry-induced response of the highest-occupied molecular\norbital.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 12:11:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2012 14:06:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 May 2012 08:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-21"}

These networks capture\nall possible features of cells and are responsible for the immense levels of\nadaptation characteristic to living systems. At any point in time only small\nsubsets of these networks are active. Any active subset of the GRN leads to the\nexpression of particular sets of molecules (expression modes). The subsets of\nactive networks change over time, leading to the observed complex dynamics of\nexpression patterns. Understanding of this dynamics becomes increasingly\nimportant in systems biology and medicine. While the importance of\ntranscription rates and catalytic interactions has been widely recognized in\nmodeling genetic regulatory systems, the understanding of the role of\ndegradation of biochemical agents (mRNA, protein) in regulatory dynamics\nremains limited. Recent experimental data suggests that there exists a\nfunctional relation between mRNA and protein decay rates and expression modes.\nIn this paper we propose a model for the dynamics of successions of sequences\nof active subnetworks of the GRN. The model is able to reproduce key\ncharacteristics of molecular dynamics, including homeostasis, multi-stability,\nperiodic dynamics, alternating activity, differentiability, and self-organized\ncritical dynamics. Moreover the model allows to naturally understand the\nmechanism behind the relation between decay rates and expression modes.

The measurement is based on the kinematic component\nof the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (KSZ) effect produced by Compton scattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) photons off the hot intracluster gas, and uses a\nlarge catalog of X-ray selected clusters and all-sky CMB maps obtained with the\nWMAP satellite. The method probes the dipole of the CMB temperature field\nevaluated at the cluster positions and within the apertures in which the CMB\nmonopole contribution vanishes, thereby isolating the signal remaining from the\nKSZ effect produced by coherently moving clusters. The detection of a highly\nsignificant dipole out to the depth of at least ~ 800 Mpc casts doubt on the\nnotion that gravitational instability from the observed mass distribution is\nthe sole -- or even dominant -- cause of the detected motions. Rather it\nappears that the flow may extend across the entire observable Universe.\nPossible implications include the possibility to constrain the primeval\npreinflationary structure of space-time and its landscape, and/or the need for\nmodifications of presently known physics (e.g. arising from a\nhigher-dimensional structure of gravity). We review these possibilities in\nlight of the measurements described here and specifically discuss the prospects\nof future measurements and the issues they should resolve. We address the\nconsistency of these large-scale velocity measurements with those obtained on\nsmaller scales by studies using galaxies as tracers, and resolve the\ndiscrepancies with two recent claims based on modified CMB analysis schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 20:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-06"}

The matter source that is responsible for the\nlate time acceleration of the Universe consists of cosmic fluid with the\nequation of state parameter $\\omega =\\frac{p}{\\rho}$ and uniform magnetic field\nof energy density $\\rho_{B}$. The study is done here under the framework of\nspatially homogeneous and anisotropic locally rotationally symmetric (LRS)\nBianchi-I cosmological model in the presence of magnetized dark energy. To get\nthe deterministic model of the Universe, we assume that the shear scalar\n$(\\sigma)$ in the model is proportional to expansion scalar $(\\theta)$. This\ncondition leads to $A=B^{n}$, where $A$ and $B$ are metric functions and $n$ is\na positive constant giving the proportionality condition between shear and\nexpansion scalar. It has been found that the isotropic distribution of\nmagnetized dark energy leads to the present accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse and the derived model is in good agreement with the recent\nastrophysical observations. The physical behavior of the Universe has been\ndiscussed in details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 06:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 10:18:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 12:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}
