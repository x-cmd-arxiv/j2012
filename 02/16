By using many-body diagrammatic\nmethods, we first study the finite-temperature phase diagram for the specific\ncase of the mass-imbalanced mixture $^{87}$Rb $-^{40}$K for different values of\nthe density imbalance. We then analyse the quantum phase transition associated\nwith the disappearance at zero temperature of the boson condensate above a\ncritical boson-fermion coupling. We find a pronounced dependence of the\ncritical coupling on the mass ratio and a weak dependence on the density\nimbalance. For a vanishingly small boson density, we derive, within our\napproximation, the asymptotic expressions for the critical coupling in the\nlimits of small and large mass ratios. These expressions are relevant also for\nthe polaron-molecule transition in a Fermi mixture at small and large mass\nratios. The analysis of the momentum distribution functions at sufficiently\nlarge density imbalances shows an interesting effect in the bosonic momentum\ndistribution due to the simultaneous presence of composite fermions and\nunpaired fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 16:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 17:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-27"}

Confusion has arisen because\nnuclear X-ray physicists and atomic quantum-optics physicists do not understand\none another's individual descriptions of related phenomena. Basic physics same\nfor all wave lengths from optical to nuclear gamma ray photons. But different\nlanguages are used to describe this physics in different domains. Crucial\nparameters vary over many orders of magnitude and what is intuitive or\ncounterintuitive varies widely. Differences in parameters arising from\ndifferences between coherent emission effects in different domains produce very\ndifferent results. Unified general treatment of the entire photon spectrum\nmakes basic physics intelligible to all. In the optical region the mean\ndistance between the scattering atoms is much longer than the photon wave\nlength, Dicke superradiant scattering is isotropic and multiple scattering,\nFano couplings are important and the lifetimes of intermediate stats are\nsufficiently short to be negligible. In X-ray scattering the mean distance\nbetween atoms is comparable to the photon wave length, Dicke superradiance is\nconcentrated in a forward peak, multiple scattering and Fano effects are\nnegligible, lifetimes are measurably long, speedup shortening the lifetime is\nimportant and most of the radiation is not elastically scattered but lost to\nabsorption. Explicit calculations for a one-dimensional array shows the great\ndifference between the case where the photon wave length is much shorter or\ncomparable to the distance between nearest neighbors. A full investigation of\nthe angular distribution and speedup of the intensity for two and\nthree-dimensional scatterers give very different results for the two cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 16:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-16"}

In\norder to optimize the track reconstruction and to fully exploit the data of\nforthcoming directional detectors, we present a likelihood method dedicated to\n3D track reconstruction. This new analysis method is applied to the MIMAC\ndetector. It requires a full simulation of track measurements in order to\ncompare real tracks to simulated ones. We conclude that a good spatial\nresolution can be achieved, i.e. sub-mm in the anode plane and cm along the\ndrift axis.

We find that the ALHAMBRA\nphotometry is able to provide an accurate photo-z and spectral classification\nfor ~88% of the spectroscopic sources over 2.5 deg^2 in different areas of the\nsurvey, all of them brighter than m678=23.5 (equivalent to r(SLOAN)~24.0).

We start with an account\nof the connections between isolating integrals, quasiperiodicity and\nangle-action variables - these variables played a unifying role throughout the\nlectures. This leads on to the phenomenon of resonant trapping and how this can\nlead to chaos in cuspy potentials and phase-space mixing in slowly evolving\npotentials. Surfaces of section and frequency analysis are introduced as\ndiagnostics of phase-space structure. Real galactic potentials include a\nfluctuating part that drives the system towards unattainable thermal\nequilibrium. Two-body encounters are only one source of fluctuations, and all\nfluctuations will drive similar evolution. We derive the orbit-averaged\nFokker-Planck equation and relations that hold between the second-order\ndiffusion coefficients and both the power spectrum of the fluctuations and the\nfirst-order diffusion coefficients. From the observed heating of the solar\nneighbourhood we show that the second-order diffusion coefficients must scale\nas J^{1/2}. We show that periodic spiral structure shifts angular momentum\noutwards, heating at the Lindblad resonances and mixing at corotation.

The targets may be isolated entities (e.g., dust\nparticles), but may also be 1-d or 2-d periodic arrays of \"target unit cells\",\nwhich can be used to study absorption, scattering, and electric fields around\narrays of nanostructures.\n  The DDA approximates the target by an array of polarizable points. The theory\nof the DDA and its implementation in DDSCAT is presented in Draine (1988) and\nDraine & Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic structures in Draine &\nFlatau (2008). Efficient near-field calculations are enabled following Flatau &\nDraine (2012). DDSCAT 7.2 allows accurate calculations of electromagnetic\nscattering from targets with size parameters 2*pi*aeff/lambda < 25 provided the\nrefractive index m is not large compared to unity (|m-1| < 2). DDSCAT 7.2\nincludes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).\n  DDSCAT 7.2 supports calculations for a variety of target geometries (e.g.,\nellipsoids, regular tetrahedra, rectangular solids, finite cylinders, hexagonal\nprisms, etc.). Target materials may be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It\nis straightforward for the user to import new target geometries into the code.\nDDSCAT 7.2 calculates total cross sections for absorption and scattering and\nselected elements of the Mueller scattering intensity matrix for specified\norientation of the target relative to the incident wave, and for specified\nscattering directions. DDSCAT 7.2 calculates E throughout a user-specified\nrectangular volume containing the target. A Fortran-90 code READNF to read E\nand P from files created by DDSCAT 7.2 is included in the distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 20:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 01:53:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 May 2012 13:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-16"}

The anisotropy of heat\nconduction, in particular, gives rise to instabilities that can access energy\nstored in a temperature gradient of either sign. We focus on the heat-flux\nbuoyancy-driven instability (HBI), which feeds on the outwardly increasing\ntemperature profile of cluster cool cores.

It is\nthen probable that, in the nonlinear regime, appreciable field-line insulation\nwill be similarly localised. Thus, while radio-mode feedback appears necessary\nin the central few tens of kpc, heat conduction may be capable of offsetting\nradiative losses throughout most of a cool core over a significant fraction of\nthe Hubble time. Finally, our linear solutions provide a convenient numerical\ntest for the nonlinear codes that tackle the saturation of such convective\ninstabilities in the presence of anisotropic transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 21:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 16:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Anisotropic heat conduction allows convective\ninstabilities to be driven by temperature gradients of either sign, the\nmagnetothermal instability (MTI) in the outskirts of non-isothermal clusters\nand the heat-flux buoyancy-driven instability (HBI) in their cooling cores. We\nemploy the Athena MHD code to investigate the nonlinear evolution of these\ninstabilities, self-consistently including the effects of anisotropic viscosity\n(i.e. Braginskii pressure anisotropy), anisotropic conduction, and radiative\ncooling. We highlight the importance of the microscale instabilities that\ninevitably accompany and regulate the pressure anisotropies generated by the\nHBI and MTI. We find that, in all but the innermost regions of cool-core\nclusters, anisotropic viscosity significantly impairs the ability of the HBI to\nreorient magnetic-field lines orthogonal to the temperature gradient. Thus,\nwhile radio-mode feedback appears necessary in the central few tens of kpc,\nconduction may be capable of offsetting radiative losses throughout most of a\ncool core over a significant fraction of the Hubble time. Magnetically-aligned\ncold filaments are then able to form by local thermal instability. Viscous\ndissipation during the formation of a cold filament produces accompanying hot\nfilaments, which can be searched for in deep Chandra observations of nearby\ncool-core clusters. In the case of the MTI, anisotropic viscosity maintains the\ncoherence of magnetic-field lines over larger distances than in the inviscid\ncase, providing a natural lower limit for the scale on which the field can\nfluctuate freely. In the nonlinear state, the magnetic field exhibits a folded\nstructure in which the field-line curvature and field strength are\nanti-correlated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 21:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Suppose a mechanism designer (site owner) wishes to optimize an\nobjective that is some function of the number and qualities of received\ncontributions. When potential contributors are strategic agents, who decide\nwhether to contribute or not to selfishly maximize their own utilities, is such\na \"best contribution\" mechanism, M_B, adequate to implement an outcome that is\noptimal for the mechanism designer?\n  We first show that in settings where a contribution's value is determined\nprimarily by an agent's expertise, and agents only strategically choose whether\nto contribute or not, contests can implement optimal outcomes: for any\nreasonable objective, the rewards for the best and remaining contributions in\nM_B can always be chosen so that the outcome in the unique symmetric\nequilibrium of M_B maximizes the mechanism designer's utility. We also show how\nthe mechanism designer can learn these optimal rewards when she does not know\nthe parameters of the agents' utilities, as might be the case in practice. We\nnext consider settings where a contribution's value depends on both the\ncontributor's expertise as well as her effort, and agents endogenously choose\nhow much effort to exert in addition to deciding whether to contribute. Here,\nwe show that optimal outcomes can never be implemented by contests if the\nsystem can rank the qualities of contributions perfectly. However, if there is\nnoise in the contributions' rankings, then the mechanism designer can again\ninduce agents to follow strategies that maximize his utility. Thus imperfect\nrankings can actually help achieve implementability of optimal outcomes when\neffort is endogenous and influences quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 00:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Our\ncalculations make use of the SMBH mass function of active and inactive galaxies\n(derived in the first paper of this series), the bolometric luminosity function\nof active galactic nuclei (AGNs), corrected for the contribution from\nCompton-thick sources, and the observed Eddington ratio distribution.

We investigate how modelled TSI compares with direct\nobservations by building a consistent modelled TSI dataset. The model, based\nonly on changes in the photospheric magnetic flux can then be tested on\nrotational, cyclical and secular timescales.\n  Methods: We use Kitt Peak and SoHO/MDI continuum images and magnetograms in\nthe SATIRE-S model to reconstruct TSI over cycles 21-23. To maximise\nindependence from TSI composites, SORCE/TIM TSI data are used to fix the one\nfree parameter of the model. We compare and combine the separate data sources\nfor the model to estimate an uncertainty on the reconstruction and prevent any\nadditional free parameters entering the model.\n  Results: The reconstruction supports the PMOD composite as being the best\nhistorical record of TSI observations, although on timescales of the solar\nrotation the IRMB composite provides somewhat better agreement. Further to\nthis, the model is able to account for 92% of TSI variations from 1978 to 2009\nin the PMOD composite and over 96% during cycle 23. The reconstruction also\ndisplays an inter-cycle, secular decline of 0.20 (+0.12 / -0.09) Wm-2 between\ncycle 23 minima, in agreement with the PMOD composite.\n  Conclusions: SATIRE-S is able to recreate TSI observations on all timescales\nof a day and longer over 31 years from 1978.

An important science goal in the gravitational-wave detection of\nthese systems is to obtain information about the equation of state of neutron\nstar matter via the measurement of the tidal polarizability parameters of\nneutron stars. To extract this piece of information will require to have\naccurate analytical descriptions of both the motion and the radiation of\ntidally interacting binaries. We improve the analytical description of the late\ninspiral dynamics by computing the next-to-next-to-leading order relativistic\ncorrection to the tidal interaction energy. Our calculation is based on an\neffective-action approach to tidal interactions, and on its transcription\nwithin the effective-one-body formalism. We find that second-order relativistic\neffects (quadratic in the relativistic gravitational potential $u=G(m_1\n+m_2)/(c^2 r)$) significantly increase the effective tidal polarizability of\nneutron stars by a distance-dependent amplification factor of the form $1 +\n\\alpha_1 \\, u + \\alpha_2 \\, u^2 +...$ where, say for an equal-mass binary,\n$\\alpha_1=5/4=1.25$ (as previously known) and $\\alpha_2=85/14\\simeq6.07143$ (as\ndetermined here for the first time).

On the other hand in a future\ndevice ELMs may cause divertor power flux densities far in excess of tolerable\nmaterial limits. The size of the energy loss per ELM is determined by\nsaturation effects in the non-linear phase of the ELM, which at present is\nhardly understood. Solitary magnetic perturbations (SMPs) are identified as\ndominant features in the radial magnetic fluctuations below 100kHz. They are\ntypically observed close (+-0.1ms) to the onset of pedestal erosion. SMPs are\nfield aligned structures rotating in the electron diamagnetic drift direction\nwith perpendicular velocities of about 10km/s. A comparison of perpendicular\nvelocities suggests that the perturbation evoking SMPs is located at or inside\nthe separatrix. Analysis of very pronounced examples showed that the number of\npeaks per toroidal turn is 1 or 2, which is clearly lower than corresponding\nnumbers in linear stability calculations. In combination with strong peaking of\nthe magnetic signals this results in a solitary appearance resembling modes\nlike palm tree modes, edge snakes or outer modes. This behavior has been\nquantified as solitariness and correlated to main plasma parameters. SMPs may\nbe considered as a signature of the non-linear ELM-phase originating at the\nseparatrix or further inside. Thus they provide a handle to investigate the\ntransition from linear to non-linear ELM phase. By comparison with data from\ngas puff imaging processes in the non-linear phase at or inside the separatrix\nand in the scrape-off-layer (SOL) can be correlated. A connection between the\npassing of an SMP and the onset of radial filament propagation has been found.\nEventually the findings related to SMPs may contribute to a future quantitative\nunderstanding of the non-linear ELM evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 14:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

Wide band echelle spectra were taken using the 2.7 m telescope.\nDetailed statistical analysis of Ca II K revealed fluctuations in the Ca II K\ncore attributable to planet induced chromospheric emission.

We aim to study a large number of\nstars with exoplanets, current level of their chromospheric activity and look\nfor a possible correlation with the exoplanetary properties.

Subsequently, we search for their dependence on the orbital\nparameters and mass of the exoplanet.

We focus on\n\"big data\" systems with a large number of drives and advanced error correction\nschemes beyond \\RAID{6}. Our RAID paradigm is based on Reed-Solomon codes, and\nthus we assume that the RAID consists of $N$ data drives and $M$ check drives.\nThe RAID fails only if the combined number of failed drives and sector errors\nexceeds $M$, a property of Reed-Solomon codes.\n  We review a number of models considered in the literature and build upon them\nto construct models usable for a large number of data and check drives. We\nattempt to account for a significant number of factors that affect RAID\nreliability, such as drive replacement or lack thereof, mistakes during service\nsuch as replacing the wrong drive, delayed repair, and the finite duration of\nRAID reconstruction. We evaluate the impact of sector failures that do not\nresult in drive replacement.\n  The reader who needs to consider large $M$ and $N$ will find applicable\nmathematical techniques concisely summarized here, and should be able to apply\nthem to similar problems. Most methods are based on the theory of continuous\ntime Markov chains, but we move beyond this framework when we consider the\nfixed time to rebuild broken hard drives, which we model using systems of delay\nand partial differential equations.\n  One universal statement is applicable across various models: increasing the\nnumber of check drives in all cases increases the reliability of the system,\nand is vastly superior to other approaches of ensuring reliability such as\nmirroring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2012 03:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

These problems should be solved by\nrestricting the choice of the Dirac gamma field in a consistent way. Recently,\nwe proposed to impose the value of the rotation rate of the tetrad field. This\nis not necessarily easy to implement and works only in a given reference frame.\nHere, we propose that the gamma field should change only by constant gauge\ntransformations. To get that situation, we are naturally led to assume that the\nmetric can be put in a space-isotropic diagonal form. When this is the case, it\ndistinguishes a preferred reference frame. We show that by defining the gamma\nfield from the \"diagonal tetrad\" in a chart in which the metric has that form,\nthe uniqueness problems are solved at once for all reference frames.
