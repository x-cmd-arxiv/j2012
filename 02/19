Such identification is useful for biological studies of\npopulation, social interaction, migration, etc. The process whereby fin\noutlines are extracted in current fin-recognition software packages is manually\nintensive and represents a major user input bottleneck: it is both time\nconsuming and visually fatiguing. This research aims to develop automated\nmethods (employing unsupervised thresholding and morphological processing\ntechniques) to extract cetacean dorsal fin outlines from digital photographs\nthereby reducing manual user input. Ideally, automatic outline generation will\nimprove the overall user experience and improve the ability of the software to\ncorrectly identify cetaceans. Various transformations from color to gray space\nwere examined to determine which produced a grayscale image in which a suitable\nthreshold could be easily identified. To assist with unsupervised thresholding,\na new metric was developed to evaluate the jaggedness of figures (\"pixelarity\")\nin an image after thresholding.

In this paper we show that every circular-arc graph allows a shortest\npath strict 2-interval routing scheme, i.e., by introducing a global order on\nthe vertices and assigning at most two (strict) intervals in this order to the\nends of every edge allows to depict a routing function that implies exclusively\nshortest paths. Since circular-arc graphs do not allow shortest path 1-interval\nrouting schemes in general, the result implies that the class of circular-arc\ngraphs has strict compactness 2, which was a hitherto open question.\nAdditionally, we show that the constructed 2-interval routing scheme is a\n1-interval routing scheme with at most one additional interval assigned at each\nvertex and we an outline algorithm to calculate the routing scheme for\ncircular-arc graphs in O(n^2) time, where n is the number of vertices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2012 15:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 15:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 12:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 08:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

A subset of the devices are mobile users that desire specific\nfiles. Each user may already have certain popular files in its cache. The\nremaining devices are access points that typically have access to a larger set\nof files. Users can download packets of their requested file from an access\npoint or from a nearby user. Our prior work optimizes peer scheduling in a\ngeneral setting, but the resulting delay can be large when applied to mobile\nnetworks. This paper focuses on the mobile case, and develops a new algorithm\nthat reduces delay by opportunistically grabbing packets from current\nneighbors. However, it treats a simpler model where each user desires a single\nfile with infinite length. An algorithm that provably optimizes throughput\nutility while incentivizing participation is developed for this case. The\nalgorithm extends as a simple heuristic in more general cases with finite file\nsizes and random active and idle periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2012 01:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}
