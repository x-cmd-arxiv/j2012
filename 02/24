Herein, we analyze the possibility that this discrepancy originates\nfrom incorrect assumptions about the nuclear reaction cross sections relevant\nfor BBN. To do this, we introduce an efficient method to calculate the changes\nin the 7Li abundance produced by arbitrary (temperature dependent)\nmodifications of the nuclear reaction rates. Then, considering that 7Li is\nmainly produced from 7Be via the electron capture process 7Be + e -> 7Li +\nnu_e, we assess the impact of the various channels of 7Be destruction.\nDifferently from previous analysis, we consider the role of unknown resonances\nby using a complete formalism which takes into account the effect of Coulomb\nand centrifugal barrier penetration and that does not rely on the use of the\nnarrow-resonance approximation. As a result of this, the possibility of a\nnuclear physics solution to the 7Li problem is significantly suppressed. Given\nthe present experimental and theoretical constraints, it is unlikely that the\n7Be + n destruction rate is underestimated by the 2.5 factor required to solve\nthe problem. We exclude, moreover, that resonant destruction in the channels\n7Be + t and 7Be + 3He can explain the 7Li puzzle.

We find that using the observed galaxy\npower spectrum, P_g^{obs}(k), x_h(z) and x_d(z) are measured more accurately\nand are significantly less correlated with each other, compared to using only\nthe information from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in P_g^{obs}(k).\nUsing the {x_h(z), x_d(z)} from P_g^{obs}(k) gives a DETF dark energy FoM\napproximately a factor of two larger than using the {x_h(z), x_d(z)} from BAO\nonly; this provides a robust conservative method to go beyond BAO only in\nextracting dark energy information from galaxy clustering data.\n  We find that a Stage IV galaxy redshift survey, with 0.7<z<2 over 15,000\n(deg)^2, can measure {x_h(z), x_d(z), f_g(z)G(z)\\tilde{P}_0^{1/2}/s^4} with\nhigh precision (where f_g(z) and G(z) are the linear growth rate and factor of\nlarge scale structure respectively, and \\tilde{P}_0 is the dimensionless\nnormalization of P_g^{obs}(k)), when redshift-space distortion information is\nincluded. The measurement of f_g(z)G(z)\\tilde{P}_0^{1/2}/s^4 provides a\npowerful test of gravity, and significantly boosts the dark energy FoM when\ngeneral relativity is assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 17:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 16:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Acceleration in reconnection sites has attracted the attention of\nresearchers recently. In this letter we analyze the energy distribution\nevolution of test particles injected in three dimensional (3D)\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of different magnetic reconnection\nconfigurations. When considering a single Sweet-Parker topology, the particles\naccelerate predominantly through a first-order Fermi process, as predicted in\nprevious work (de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian, 2005) and demonstrated\nnumerically in Kowal, de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian (2011). When turbulence is\nincluded within the current sheet, the acceleration rate, which depends on the\nreconnection rate, is highly enhanced. This is because reconnection in the\npresence of turbulence becomes fast and independent of resistivity (Lazarian &\nVishniac, 1999; Kowal et al., 2009) and allows the formation of a thick volume\nfilled with multiple simultaneously reconnecting magnetic fluxes. Charged\nparticles trapped within this volume suffer several head-on scatterings with\nthe contracting magnetic fluctuations, which significantly increase the\nacceleration rate and results in a first-order Fermi process. For comparison,\nwe also tested acceleration in MHD turbulence, where particles suffer\ncollisions with approaching and receding magnetic irregularities, resulting in\na reduced acceleration rate. We argue that the dominant acceleration mechanism\napproaches a second order Fermi process in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 18:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

An approach for determining the exact approximation factor and the\ncorresponding optimal rounding was established in the analysis of MAX-CUT (KKMO\n2004) and the use of the Invariance Principle (MOO 2005).

An encoder sequentially compresses a sequence of vector-sources\nthat are spatially i.i.d. but temporally correlated according to a first-order\nMarkov process. The channel erases up to B packets in a single burst, but\nreveals all other packets to the destination. The destination is required to\nreproduce all the source-vectors instantaneously and in a lossless manner,\nexcept those sequences that occur in an error propagation window of length B +\nW following the start of the erasure burst. We define the rate-recovery\nfunction R(B, W) - the minimum achievable compression rate per source sample in\nthis framework - and develop upper and lower bounds on this function. Our upper\nbound is obtained using a random binning technique, whereas our lower bound is\nobtained by drawing connections to multi-terminal source coding. Our upper and\nlower bounds coincide, yielding R(B, W), in some special cases. More generally,\nboth the upper and lower bounds equal the rate for predictive coding plus a\nterm that decreases as 1/(W+1), thus establishing a scaling behaviour of the\nrate-recovery function. For a special class of semi-deterministic Markov\nsources we propose a new optimal coding scheme: prospicient coding. An\nextension of this coding technique to Gaussian sources is also developed.

Numerous mm-wave single-dish\nobservations have been obtained and could directly measure mesospheric\nline-of-sight winds by mapping Doppler-shifts on CO rotational lines, but their\nlimited spatial resolution makes their interpretation difficult. By using\ninterferometric facilities, one can obtain better resolution on Doppler-shifts\nmaps, allowing in particular to put firmer constraints on the respective\ncontributions of the SSAS and RSZ circulations to the global mesospheric wind\nfield. We report on interferometric observations of the CO(1-0) line obtained\nwith the IRAM-Plateau de Bure interferometer in November 2007 and June 2009,\nthat could map the upper mesosphere dynamics on the morning hemisphere with a\nvery good spatial resolution (3.5-5.5\"). All the obtained measurements show,\nwith a remarkably good temporal stability, that the wind globally flows in the\n(sky) East-West direction, corresponding in the observed geometry either to an\nunexpected prograde zonal wind or a SSAS flow. A very localized inversion of\nthe wind direction, that could correspond to a RSZ wind, is also repeatedly\ndetected in the night hemisphere. The presence of significant meridional winds\nis not evidenced. Using models with different combinations of zonal and SSAS\nwinds, we find that the data is best reproduced by a dominant SSAS flow with a\nmaximal velocity at the terminator of ~200 m/s, displaying large diurnal and\nlatitudinal asymmetries, combined with an equatorial RSZ wind of 70-100 m/s,\noverall indicating a wind-field structure consistent with but much more complex\nthan the usual representation of the mesospheric dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 20:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Since the epicyclic approximation is not valid for large radial\nexcursions, we use orbital equations of the form we call p-ellipses. These have\nbeen shown to provide accurate representations of orbits in power-law halo\npotentials. In the case of a purely tidal disturbance the resulting tidal tails\nhave simple structure. Scalings for their maximum lengths and other\ncharacteristics as functions of the tidal amplitude and the exponent of the\npower-law potentials are described. The analytic model shows that azimuthal\ncaustics (orbit crossing zones) are produced generically in these tails at a\nfixed azimuth relative to the point of closest approach. Long tails, with high\norder caustics at their base are also produced at larger amplitudes. The\nanalysis is extended to nonlinear disturbances and multiple encounters, which\nbreak the symmetries of tidal perturbations. As the strength of the nonlinear\nterms is varied the structure of the resulting forms varies from symmetric\ntails to one-armed plumes. Cases with two or more impulse disturbances are also\nconsidered as the simplest analytic models distinguishing between prograde and\nretrograde encounters. A specific mechanism for the formation of tidal dwarf\ngalaxies at the end of tails is suggested as a consequence of resonance effects\nin prolonged encounters.

The main purpose\nof quasometry is to link the sub-milliarcsecond radio frame (ICRF) with the\nexisting and emerging optical reference frames of similar accuracy, constructed\nby astrometric satellites. Some of the main difficulties in achieving this goal\nare discussed, e.g., the extended structures of quasar hosts, apparent motion\non the sky, optical variability, galactic companions, faintness. Besides the\nstrategic purpose, quasometry is undoubtedly useful for global astrometric\nsurveys, as it helps to verify or even correct the resulting reference frames.\nThere are two options of using measurements of distant quasars in a global\nastrometric solution: 1) hard constraints embedded in the fabric of\nobservational equations; 2) {\\it a posteriori} fitting of zonal errors. The\nrelative benefits and shortcoming of the two options are reviewed.

In some of these cases, the\nevents may exhibit evidence of planets orbiting the nearby star. In fact,\nplanets can even be discovered during relatively distant passages. Here, we\nstudy the lensing signatures associated with planets orbiting nearby\nhigh-proper-motion stars. We find the following. (1) Wide-orbit planets can be\ndetected for all distances of closest approach between the foreground and\nbackground stars, potentially producing independent events long before and/or\nafter the closest approach. (2) Close-orbit planets can be detected for\nintermediate distances of closest approach, producing quasiperiodic signatures\nthat may occur days or weeks before and after the stellar-lens event. (3)\nPlanets in the so-called 'zone for resonant lensing' can significantly increase\nthe magnification when the distance of closest approach is small, making the\nstellar-lens event easier to detect, while simultaneously providing evidence\nfor planets. Because approaches close enough to allow planets to be detected\ncan be predicted, we can plan observing strategies to take advantage of the\ntheoretical framework built in this paper, which describes the sequence of\nexpected effects in terms of a sequence of detection regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 21:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 20:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The exciton is described in terms of the electron and heavy hole\nspins interacting via exchange interaction with magnetic impurity, via\nhypeprfine interaction with a finite number of nuclear spins and via dipole\ninteraction with photons. The time-evolution of the exciton, magnetic impurity\nand nuclear spins is calculated exactly between quantum jumps corresponding to\nexciton radiative recombination. The collapse of the wavefunction and the\nrefilling of the quantum dot with new spin polarized exciton is shown to lead\nto build up of magnetization of the magnetic impurity as well as nuclear spin\npolarization.

The difference between the\ntwo cases is shown to originate from the momentum dependence of the p-wave\ninteraction, which vanishes in the low momentum limit. We also identify the\npseudogap regime in the phase diagram with respect to the temperature and the\np-wave interaction strength.

However, standard isosurface\nrendering has some limitations in effectiveness. First, it uses a monotone\ncolored approach and can only visualize the geometry features of an isosurface.\nThe lack of the capability to illustrate the material property and the internal\nstructures behind an isosurface has been a big limitation of this method in\napplications. Another limitation of isosurface rendering is the difficulty to\nreveal physically meaningful structures, which are hidden in one or multiple\nisosurfaces. As such, the application requirements of extract and recombine\nstructures of interest can not be implemented effectively with isosurface\nrendering. In this work, we develop an enhanced isosurface rendering technique\nto improve the effectiveness while maintaining the performance efficiency of\nthe standard isosurface rendering. First, an isosurface color enhancement\nmethod is proposed to illustrate the neighborhood density and to reveal some of\nthe internal structures. Second, we extend the structure extraction capability\nof isosurface rendering by enabling explicit scene exploration within a\n3D-view, using surface peeling, voxel-selecting, isosurface segmentation, and\nmulti-surface-structure visualization. Our experiments show that the color\nenhancement not only improves the visual fidelity of the rendering, but also\nreveals the internal structures without significant increase of the\ncomputational cost. Explicit scene exploration is also demonstrated as a\npowerful tool in some application scenarios, such as displaying multiple\nabdominal organs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 01:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-27"}

Recent numerical simulations indicate that assembly of a typical\nfirst galaxy with virial temperature (~10^4K) proceeds via cold and dense flows\npenetrating deep to the center, where the supersonic streams collide each other\nto develop a hot and dense (~10^4K, ~10^3/cc) shocked gas. The post-shock layer\nfirst cools by efficient Ly alpha emission and contracts isobarically until\n8000K. Whether the layer continues the isobaric contraction depends on the\ndensity at this moment: if the density is high enough for collisionally\nexciting H2 rovibrational levels (>10^4/cc), enhanced H2 collisional\ndissociation suppresses the gas to cool further. In this case, the layer\nfragments into massive (>10^5Msun) clouds, which collapse isothermally (~8000K)\nby the Ly alpha cooling without subsequent fragmentation. As an outcome, SMSs\nare expected to form and evolve eventually to seeds of supermassive black holes\n(SMBH). By calculating thermal evolution of the post-shock gas, we delimit the\nrange of post-shock conditions for the SMS formation, which can be expressed\nas: T>6000K/(n/10^4/cc) for n<10^4/cc and T>5000-6000K for n>10^4/cc, depending\nsomewhat on initial ionization degree. We found that metal enrichment does not\naffect the above condition for metallicity below 10^-3Zsun if metals are in the\ngas phase, while condensation of several percent of metals into dust decreases\nthis critical value of metallicity by an order of magnitude. Unlike the\npreviously proposed scenario for SMS formation, which postulates extremely\nstrong ultraviolet radiation to quench H2 cooling, our scenario naturally\nexplains the SMBH seed formation in the assembly process of the first galaxies,\neven without such a strong radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 07:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In\nthis model, the process of gene expression with auto-regulation is described by\nfast/slow dynamics. The production of mRNA is assumed to follow a compound\nPoisson process occurring at a rate depending on protein levels (the phenomena\ncalled bursting in molecular biology) and the production of protein is a linear\nfunction of mRNA numbers. When the dynamics of mRNA is assumed to be a fast\nprocess (due to faster mRNA degradation than that of protein) we prove that,\nwith appropriate scalings in the burst rate, jump size or translational rate,\nthe bursting phenomena can be transmitted to the slow variable. We show that,\ndepending on the scaling, the reduced equation is either a stochastic\ndifferential equation with a jump Poisson process or a deterministic ordinary\ndifferential equation. These results are significant because adiabatic\nreduction techniques seem to have not been rigorously justified for a\nstochastic differential system containing a jump Markov process. We expect that\nthe results can be generalized to adiabatic methods in more general stochastic\nhybrid systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 10:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 15:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 23:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

We obtain a simple lower bound, using \\textit{breadth-first search}\nalgorithm and show that for a large class of graphs which can be classified as\nthe ones which locally \"look like\" a tree in sense of the \\emph{local weak\nconvergence}, this lower bound gives better approximation than some of the\nknown approximations through matrix-method based upper bounds derived by\nDraief, Ganesh and Massoulie in 2008.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 12:12:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 09:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-21"}

The magnetic field is\nquasi-isotropic and has field strengths weaker than 100G. It is pervasive and\nmay host a local dynamo. Aims: We aim to determine the length scale of the\nturbulent magnetic field in the quiet Sun. Methods: The Stokes V area asymmetry\nis sensitive to minute variations in the magnetic topology along the line of\nsight. Using data provided by Hinode-SOT/SP instrument, we performed a\nstatistical study of this quantity.We classified the different magnetic regimes\nand infer properties of the turbulent magnetic regime. In particular we\nmeasured the correlation length associated to these fields for the first time.\nResults: The histograms of Stokes V area asymmetries reveal three different\nregimes: one organized, quasi-vertical and strong field (flux tubes or other\nstructures of the like); a strongly asymmetric group of profiles found around\nfield concentrations; and a turbulent isotropic field.

After chemical decoupling, or freeze-out, dark matter no\nlonger annihilates but is still kept in local thermal equilibrium due to\nscattering events with the much more abundant standard model particles. During\nkinetic decoupling, even these processes stop to be effective, which eventually\nsets the scale for a small-scale cutoff in the matter density fluctuations.\nAfterwards, the WIMP temperature decreases more quickly than the heat bath\ntemperature, which causes dark matter to reenter an era of annihilation if the\ncross-section is enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect. Here, we give a detailed\nand self-consistent description of these effects. As an application, we\nconsider the phenomenology of simple leptophilic models that have been\ndiscussed in the literature and find that the relic abundance can be affected\nby as much two orders of magnitude or more.

Recently electron\nbeams carrying very large values of axial OAM have been generated. In the\nabsence of coupling to an external electromagnetic field the propagation of\nsuch vortex electron beams is virtually identical mathematically to that of\nvortex photon beams propagating in a medium with a homogeneous index of\nrefraction. But when coupled to an external electromagnetic field the\npropagation of vortex electron beams is distinctly different from photons. Here\nwe use the exact path integral solution to Schrodingers equation to examine the\ntime evolution of an electron wave function carrying axial OAM. Interestingly\nwe find that the nonzero OAM wave function can be obtained from the zero OAM\nwave function, in the case considered here, simply by multipling it by an\nappropriate time and position dependent prefactor. Hence adding OAM and\npropagating can in this case be replaced by first propagating then adding OAM.\nAlso, the results shown provide an explicit illustration of the fact that the\ngyromagnetic ratio for OAM is unity.

With a Monte Carlo\ncode, we model the distribution of DRVmax, the maximum radial velocity shift\nbetween exposures of the same star, as a function of the binary fraction within\n0.05 AU, fbin, and the power-law index in the separation distribution at the\nend of the common envelope phase, alpha. Although there is some degeneracy\nbetween fbin and alpha, the the fifteen high DRVmax systems that we find\nconstrain the combination of these parameters, which determines a white dwarf\nmerger rate per unit stellar mass of 1.4(+3.4,-1.0)e-13 /yr/Msun (1-sigma\nlimits). This is remarkably similar to the measured rate of Type Ia supernovae\nper unit stellar mass in Milky-Way-like Sbc galaxies. The rate of\nsuper-Chandrasekhar mergers is only 1.0(+1.6,-0.6)e-14 /yr/Msun. We conclude\nthat there are not enough close binary white dwarf systems to reproduce the\nobserved Type Ia SN rate in the 'classic' double degenerate super-Chandrasekhar\nscenario. On the other hand, if sub-Chandrasekhar mergers can lead to Type Ia\nSNe, as recently suggested by some studies, they could make a major\ncontribution to the overall Type Ia SN rate. Although unlikely, we cannot rule\nout contamination of our sample by M-dwarf binaries or non-Gaussian errors.\nThese issues will be clarified in the near future by completing the follow-up\nof all 15 high DRVmax systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 15:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 20:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
