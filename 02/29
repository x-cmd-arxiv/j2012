We provide an\nalgorithm for its computation, based on the support reduction algorithm. We\ncompare its performance to those of the empirical estimator, on the basis of a\nsimulation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 16:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-29"}

We develop a\ntheoretical framework to quantify the underlying potential landscape and\nbiological paths for cell development and differentiation. We propose a new\nmechanism of differentiation and development through binding/unbinding of\nregulatory proteins to the gene promoters. We found indeed the differentiated\nstates can emerge from the slow promoter binding/unbinding processes.\nFurthermore, under slow promoter binding/unbinding, we found multiple\nmeta-stable differentiated states. This can explain the origin of multiple\nstates observed in the recent experiments. In addition, the kinetic time\nquantified by mean first passage transition time for the differentiation and\nreprogramming strongly depends on the time scale of the promoter\nbinding/unbinding processes. We discovered an optimal speed for differentiation\nfor certain binding/unbinding rates of regulatory proteins to promoters.

An algorithm to reproduce\nthe zero age main sequence (ZAMS) reddened colours was developed in order to\nderive the average visual extinction (Av) that provides the best fitting of the\nobservational data.

Imaging spectrometers\nare therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras (HSCs). Higher\nspectral resolution enables material identification via spectroscopic analysis,\nwhich facilitates countless applications that require identifying materials in\nscenarios unsuitable for classical spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatial\nresolution of HSCs, microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering,\nspectra measured by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus,\naccurate estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of a\nfew materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some of:\nthe number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their abundances at\neach pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem because of\nmodel inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental conditions, endmember\nvariability, and data set size.

We discuss the\nEP-violation phenomenology of dilaton-like models, which is likely to be\ndominated by the linear superposition of two effects: a signal proportional to\nthe nuclear Coulomb energy, related to the variation of the fine-structure\nconstant, and a signal proportional to the surface nuclear binding energy,\nrelated to the variation of the light quark masses. We recall the various\ntheoretical arguments (including a recently proposed anthropic argument)\nsuggesting that the EP be violated at a small, but not unmeasurably small\nlevel. This motivates the need for improved tests of the EP. These tests are\nprobing new territories in physics that are related to deep, and mysterious,\nissues in fundamental physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 18:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A context in which this kind\nof ambiguities arises and prevents the derivation of robust results is, e.g.,\nin the quantum analysis of cosmological perturbations. In these situations,\ntypically, a suitable scaling of the field by a time dependent function leads\nto a description in an auxiliary static background, though the nonstationarity\nstill shows up in a time dependent mass. For such a field description, and\nassuming the compactness of the spatial sections, we recently proved in three\nor less spatial dimensions that the criteria of a natural implementation of the\nspatial symmetries and of a unitary time evolution are able to select a unique\nclass of unitarily equivalent vacua, and hence of Fock representations. In this\nwork, we succeed to extend our uniqueness result to the consideration of all\npossible field descriptions that can be reached by a time dependent canonical\ntransformation which, in particular, involves a scaling of the field by a\nfunction of time. This kind of canonical transformations modify the dynamics of\nthe system and introduce a further ambiguity in its quantum description,\nexceeding the choice of a Fock representation. Remarkably, for any compact\nspatial manifold in less than four dimensions, we show that our criteria\neliminate any possible nontrivial scaling of the field other than that leading\nto the description in an auxiliary static background. Besides, we show that\neither no time dependent redefinition of the field momentum is allowed or, if\nthis may happen, the redefinition does not introduce any Fock representation\nthat cannot be obtained by a unitary transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 19:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We\npresent supersymmetric models in which such a split spectrum is obtained\nthrough \"geometries\": being \"close to\" electroweak symmetry breaking implies\nbeing \"away from\" supersymmetry breaking, and vice versa. In particular, we\npresent models in 5D warped spacetime, in which supersymmetry breaking and\nHiggs fields are located on the ultraviolet and infrared branes, respectively,\nand the top multiplets are localized to the infrared brane. The hierarchy of\nthe Yukawa matrices can be obtained while keeping near flavor degeneracy\nbetween the first two generation sfermions, avoiding stringent constraints from\nflavor and CP violation. Through the AdS/CFT correspondence, the models can be\ninterpreted as purely 4D theories in which the top and Higgs multiplets are\ncomposites of some strongly interacting sector exhibiting nontrivial dynamics\nat a low energy. Because of the compositeness of the Higgs and top multiplets,\nLandau pole constraints for the Higgs and top couplings apply only up to the\ndynamical scale, allowing for a relatively heavy Higgs boson, including m_h =\n125 GeV as suggested by the recent LHC data. We analyze electroweak symmetry\nbreaking for a well-motivated subset of these models, and find that fine-tuning\nin electroweak symmetry breaking is indeed ameliorated.

A difficulty in the\nconception of policies to reverse these trends is the identification of the\ndrivers behind the global epidemics. Here, we implement a spatial spreading\nanalysis to investigate whether diabetes, obesity and cancer show spatial\ncorrelations revealing the effect of collective and global factors acting above\nindividual choices. We adapt a theoretical framework for critical physical\nsystems displaying collective behavior to decipher the laws of spatial\nspreading of diseases. We find a regularity in the spatial fluctuations of\ntheir prevalence revealed by a pattern of scale-free long-range correlations.\nThe fluctuations are anomalous, deviating in a fundamental way from the weaker\ncorrelations found in the underlying population distribution. This collective\nbehavior indicates that the spreading dynamics of obesity, diabetes and some\nforms of cancer like lung cancer are analogous to a critical point of\nfluctuations, just as a physical system in a second-order phase transition.\nAccording to this notion, individual interactions and habits may have\nnegligible influence in shaping the global patterns of spreading. Thus, obesity\nturns out to be a global problem where local details are of little importance.\nInterestingly, we find the same critical fluctuations in obesity and diabetes,\nand in the activities of economic sectors associated with food production such\nas supermarkets, food and beverage stores--- which cluster in a different\nuniversality class than other generic sectors of the economy.

This instability probability is proportional to the tails of the\neigenvalue distribution of the system which are calculated to exponential\naccuracy using methodologies developed within the Anderson model and its ties\nwith random walks in random media.

A key element in this approach is the use of central moments to\nspecify collision process and forcing, and thereby naturally maintaining\nGalilean invariance, an important characteristic of fluid flows. When the\ndifferent central moments are relaxed at different rates like in a standard\nmultiple relaxation time (MRT) formulation based on raw moments, it is endowed\nwith a number of desirable physical and numerical features. Since the collision\noperator exhibits a cascaded structure, this approach is also known as the\ncascaded LBM. While the cascaded LBM has been developed sometime ago, a\nsystematic study of its numerical properties, such as accuracy, grid\nconvergence and stability for well defined canonical problems is lacking and\nthe present work is intended to fulfill this need. We perform a quantitative\nstudy of the performance of the cascaded LBM for a set of benchmark problems of\ndiffering complexity, viz., Poiseuille flow, decaying Taylor-Green vortex flow\nand lid-driven cavity flow. We first establish its grid convergence and\ndemonstrate second order accuracy under diffusive scaling for both the velocity\nfield and its derivatives, i.e. components of the strain rate tensor, as well.\nThe method is shown to quantitatively reproduce steady/unsteady analytical\nsolutions or other numerical results with excellent accuracy. Numerical\nexperiments further demonstrate that the central moment MRT LBM results in\nsignificant stability improvements when compared with certain existing\ncollision models at moderate additional computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 20:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-29"}

Dynamically, a residual\nplanetesimal population is needed to damp the high eccentricities of the\nterrestrial planets after the giant impact stage. Geochemically, highly\nsiderophile element (HSE) abundance patterns inferred for the terrestrial\nplanets and the Moon suggest that a total of about 0.01 M_Earth of chondritic\nmaterial was delivered as `late veneer' by planetesimals to the terrestrial\nplanets after the end of giant impacts. Here we combine these two independent\nlines of evidence for a leftover population of planetesimals and show that: 1)\nA residual planetesimal population containing 0.01 M_Earth is able to damp the\neccentricities of the terrestrial planets after giant impacts to their observed\nvalues. 2) At the same time, this planetesimal population can account for the\nobserved relative amounts of late veneer added to the Earth, Moon and Mars\nprovided that the majority of the late veneer was delivered by small\nplanetesimals with radii <10m. These small planetesimal sizes are required to\nensure efficient damping of the planetesimal's velocity dispersion by mutual\ncollisions, which in turn ensures that the planets' accretion cross sections\nare significantly enhanced by gravitational focusing above their geometric\nvalues. Specifically we find, in the limit that the relative velocity between\nthe terrestrial planets and the planetesimals is significantly less than the\nterrestrial planets' escape velocities, that gravitational focusing yields an\naccretion ratio Earth/Mars~17, which agrees well with the accretion ratio\ninferred from HSEs of 12-23. For the Earth-Moon system, we find an accretion\nratio of ~200, which is consistent with estimates of 150-700 derived from HSE\nabundances that include the lunar crust as well as mantle component.

Absence of a similar\nperiodicity in the H-alpha flux and the total X-ray flux points to a different\nsource of photometric variations. The H-alpha emission line appears\nintrinsically broad and symmetric, and both the profile and its variability\nsuggest an origin in the post-shock cooling region. An accretion event,\nsignaled by soft X-rays, is traced spectroscopically for the first time through\nthe optical emission line profiles.

We presented a questionnaire to 34\nanonymous participants, where each question described a decision to be made\namong two conflicting motivations and asked the participants to rate\nanalogically the pleasantness and the intensity of the experienced emotion. We\nfound that the results were compatible with the predictions of the Circumplex\nmodel for basic emotions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 21:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-05"}

For a dynamical system preserving a probability measure, this\nproperty is named `mixing' and is equivalent to the decay of correlations for\nobservables in phase space. For the class of dynamical systems preserving\ninfinite measures, this probabilistic connection is lost and no completely\nsatisfactory definition has yet been found which expresses the idea of losing\ntrack of the initial state of a system due to its chaotic dynamics. This is\nactually on open problem in the field of infinite ergodic theory. Virtually all\nthe definitions that have been attempted so far use \"local observables\", that\nis, functions that essentially only \"see\" finite portions of the phase space.\nIn this note we introduce the concept of \"global observable\", a function that\ngauges a certain quantity throughout the phase space. This concept is based on\nthe notion of infinite-volume average, which plays the role of the expected\nvalue of a global observable. Endowed with these notions, whose rigorous\ndefinition is to be specified on a case-by-case basis, we give a number of\ndefinitions of infinite mixing. These fall in two categories: global-global\nmixing, which expresses the \"decorrelation\" of two global observables, and\nglobal-local mixing, where a global and a local observable are considered\ninstead. These definitions are tested on two types of\ninfinite-measure-preserving dynamical systems, the random walks and the Farey\nmap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 21:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

Mercer asserted that a Cartan bimodule isomorphism\nbetween Cartan bimodule algebras A_1 and A_2 extends uniquely to a normal\n*-isomorphism of the von Neumann algebras generated by A_1 and A_2 [13,\nCorollary 4.3]. Mercer's argument relied upon the Spectral Theorem for\nBimodules of Muhly, Saito and Solel [15, Theorem 2.5]. Unfortunately, the\narguments in the literature supporting [15, Theorem 2.5] contain gaps, and\nhence Mercer's proof is incomplete.\n  In this paper, we use the outline in [16, Remark 2.17] to give a proof of\nMercer's Theorem under the additional hypothesis that the given Cartan bimodule\nisomorphism is weak-* continuous. Unlike the arguments contained in [13, 15],\nwe avoid the use of the Feldman-Moore machinery from [8]; as a consequence, our\nproof does not require the von Neumann algebras generated by the algebras A_i\nto have separable preduals. This point of view also yields some insights on the\nvon Neumann subalgebras of a Cartan pair (M,D), for instance, a strengthening\nof a result of Aoi [1].\n  We also examine the relationship between various topologies on a von Neumann\nalgebra M with a Cartan MASA D. This provides the necessary tools to\nparametrize the family of Bures-closed bimodules over a Cartan MASA in terms of\nprojections in a certain abelian von Neumann algebra; this result may be viewed\nas a weaker form of the Spectral Theorem for Bimodules, and is a key ingredient\nin the proof of our version of Mercer's theorem. Our results lead to a notion\nof spectral synthesis for weak-* closed bimodules appropriate to our context,\nand we show that any von Neumann subalgebra of M which contains D is synthetic.\n  We observe that a result of Sinclair and Smith shows that any Cartan MASA in\na von Neumann algebra is norming in the sense of Pop, Sinclair and Smith.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2012 23:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2013 18:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

The motivation for this work comes from the\nfact that, as discovered experimentally more than a decade ago, the key\nvariable in dynamic wetting flows -the dynamic contact angle - depends not just\non the velocity of the three-phase contact line but on the entire flow\nfield/geometry. Hence, to describe this effect, it becomes necessary to use the\nmathematical model that has this dependence as its integral part. A new\nphysical effect, termed the `hydrodynamic resist to dynamic wetting', is\ndiscovered where the influence of the capillary's radius on the dynamic contact\nangle, and hence on the global flow, is computed. The capabilities of the\nnumerical framework are then demonstrated by comparing the results to\nexperiments on the unsteady capillary rise, where excellent agreement is\nobtained. Practical recommendations on the spatial resolution required by the\nnumerical scheme for a given set of non-dimensional similarity parameters are\nprovided, and a comparison to asymptotic results available in limiting cases\nconfirms that the code is converging to the correct solution. The appendix\ngives a user-friendl step-by-step guide specifying the entire implementation\nand allowing the reader to easily reproduce all presented results, including\nthe benchmark calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 07:26:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 14:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The statistical relation between galaxy and\nmatter density field is commonly referred as galaxy bias. In this paper, we\ntest the linear bias model with weak-lensing and galaxy clustering measurements\nin the 2 square degrees COSMOS field (Scoville et al. 2007). We estimate the\nbias of galaxies between redshifts z=0.2 and z=1, and over correlation scales\nbetween R=0.2 h^-1 Mpc and R=15 h^-1 Mpc.

The nuclear interactions are described by\nthe exchange of the sigma, omega, and rho virtual mesons. The equilibrium\nconditions are given by our recently developed theoretical framework based on\nthe Einstein-Maxwell-Thomas-Fermi equations along with the constancy of the\ngeneral relativistic Fermi energies of particles, the \"Klein potentials\",\nthroughout the configuration. The equations are solved numerically in the case\nof zero temperatures and for selected parametrization of the nuclear models.\nThe solutions lead to a new structure of the star: a positively charged core at\nsupranuclear densities surrounded by an electronic distribution of thickness\n$\\sim \\hbar/(m_e c)$ of opposite charge, as well as a neutral crust at lower\ndensities. Inside the core there is a Coulomb potential well of depth $\\sim\nm_\\pi c^2/e$. The constancy of the Klein potentials in the transition from the\ncore to the crust, impose the presence of an overcritical electric field $\\sim\n(m_\\pi/m_e)^2 E_c$, the critical field being $E_c=m^2_e c^3/(e \\hbar)$. The\nelectron chemical potential and the density decrease, in the boundary\ninterface, until values $\\mu^{\\rm crust}_e < \\mu^{\\rm core}_e$ and $\\rho_{\\rm\ncrust}<\\rho_{\\rm core}$. For each central density, an entire family of\ncore-crust interface boundaries and, correspondingly, an entire family of\ncrusts with different mass and thickness, exist.

Indeed, in order to\navoid absorption of \\gamma rays in the dense ultraviolet radiation field of the\nbroad line region (BLR), one is forced to invoke some unconventional\nastrophysical picture, like for instance the existence of a very compact (r\\sim\n10^{14} cm) emitting blob at a large distance (R \\sim10^{18} cm) from the jet\nbase. We offer the investigation of a scenario based on the standard blazar\nmodel for PKS 1222+216 where \\gamma rays are produced close to the central\nengine, but we add the new assumption that inside the source photons can\noscillate into axion-like particles (ALPs), which are a generic prediction of\nseveral extensions of the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions.\nAs a result, a considerable fraction of very-high-energy photons can escape\nabsorption from the BLR through the mechanism of photon-ALP oscillations much\nin the same way as they largely avoid absorption from extragalactic background\nlight when propagating over cosmic distances in the presence of large-scale\nmagnetic fields in the nG range.

Most attractive places for catching low-mass\nstar formation in the act are young stellar clusters and associations, still\n(half-)embedded in star-forming regions. The low-mass stars in such regions are\nstill in their pre--main-sequence (PMS) evolutionary phase. The peculiar nature\nof these objects and the contamination of their samples by the evolved\npopulations of the Galactic disk impose demanding observational techniques for\nthe detection of complete numbers of PMS stars in the Milky Way. The Magellanic\nClouds, the companion galaxies to our own, demonstrate an exceptional star\nformation activity. The low extinction and stellar field contamination in\nstar-forming regions of these galaxies imply a more efficient detection of\nlow-mass PMS stars than in the Milky Way, but their distance from us make the\napplication of special detection techniques unfeasible. Nonetheless, imaging\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope yield the discovery of solar and sub-solar PMS\nstars in the Magellanic Clouds from photometry alone. Unprecedented numbers of\nsuch objects are identified as the low-mass stellar content of their\nstar-forming regions, changing completely our picture of young stellar systems\noutside the Milky Way, and extending the extragalactic stellar IMF below the\npersisting threshold of a few solar masses.

The limit models are\nobtained by averaging with respect to the fast dynamics. We can include all\ntypical effects in the applications: short-range repulsion, long-range\nattraction, and alignment. For instance, we can rigorously show that the\nCucker-Smale model is reduced to the Vicsek model without noise in this\nasymptotic limit. Finally, a formal expansion based on the reduced dynamics\nallows us to treat the case of diffusion. This technique follows closely the\ngyroaverage method used when studying the magnetic confinement of charged\nparticles. The main new mathematical difficulty is to deal with measure\nsolutions in this expansion procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 14:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-01"}

The modulator is a metal-insulator-metal waveguide with an\nadditional ultra-thin layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). Bias is applied to the\nmultilayer core by means of metal plates that serve as electrodes. External\nfield changes carrier density in the ultra-thin ITO layer, which influences the\npermittivity. The metal-insulator-metal system possesses a plasmon resonance,\nand it is strongly affected by changes in the permittivity of the active layer.\nTo improve performance of the structure we propose several optimizations.

We analyze eigenmodes of the waveguide structure\nand specify the range for its efficient operation. We show that substituting\nthe continuous active layer by a one-dimension periodic stripes increases\ntransmittance through the device and keeps the modulator's performance at the\nsame level.

It is concluded that the division algebra approach to\nthe the theory of unification of fundamental interactions as the case of GUTs\nleads to the consequences towards the new understanding of these theories which\nincorporate the existence of magnetic monopole and dyon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Feb 2012 07:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

There\nare offered the generalized Einstein's equations, describing not only the\ngravity forces, but also the cosmological forces of repulsion, which are\ngeometric in their nature.\n  The generalized Einstein equations are used to derive the cosmological\nFriedman's equations describing the dynamics of a homogeneous isotropic\nuniverse with the influence of cosmological repulsion forces. We propose a\ncosmological model of the universe based on these equations.
