We find that the breakdown process follows the equal load sharing fiber\nbundle model without any detectable spatial correlations between the positions\nof the failing fibers until localization sets in. The onset of localization is\nan instability, not a phase transition. Depending on the elastic constant\ndescribing the elastic half space, localization sets in before or after the\ncritical load causing the interface to fail completely, is reached. There is a\ncrossover between failure due to localization or failure without spatial\ncorrelations when tuning the elastic constant, not a phase transition. Contrary\nto earlier claims based on models different from ours, we find that a finite\nfraction of fibers must fail before the critical load is attained, even in the\nextreme localization regime, i.e.\\ for very small elastic constant. We\nfurthermore find that the critical load remains finite for all values of the\nelastic constant in the limit of an infinitely large system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 16:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 11:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-18"}

Very substantial role is played also by the carrier density $n_s$ that\nnaturally emerges as an integration constant of the GL equation. Physical\ninterpretation of the obtained results is based on the $n_s$-dependent\neffective potential $V_{eff}({\\bf r})$ created by the nonlinear term and its\ninfluence on the lowest eigenvalue of the corresponding Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation.

Surface layers, rotation, and magnetic fields imprint erratic\nfrequency shifts, trends, and other non-random behavior in the frequency\nspectra. As our observational uncertainties become smaller, these are\nincreasingly important and difficult to deal with using standard fitting\ntechniques. To improve the models, new ways to compare their predictions with\nobservations need to be conceived. In this paper we present a completely\nprobabilistic (Bayesian) approach to asteroseismic model fitting. It allows for\nvarying degrees of prior mode identification, corrections for the discrete\nnature of the grid, and most importantly implements a treatment of systematic\nerrors, such as the \"surface effects.\" It removes the need to apply semi-\nempirical corrections to the observations prior to fitting them to the models\nand results in a consistent set of probabilities with which the model physics\ncan be probed and compared. As an example, we show a detailed asteroseismic\nanalysis of the Sun.

In reality the natural time delay should be included in the\ncorresponding models. We investigate a general class of linear models of dyadic\ninteractions with a constant discrete time delay. We prove that in such models\nthe changes of stability of the stationary points from instability to stability\nor vice versa occur for various intervals of the parameters which determine the\nintensity of interactions. The conditions guaranteeing arbitrary number (zero,\none ore more) of switches are formulated and the relevant theorems are proved.\nA systematic analysis of all generic cases is carried out. It is obvious that\nthe dynamics of interactions depend both on the strength of reactions of\npartners on their own states as well as on the partner's state. Results\npresented in this paper suggest that the joint strength of the reactions of\npartners to the partner's state, reflected by the product of the strength of\nreactions of both partners, has greater impact on the dynamics of relationships\nthan the joint strength of reactions to their own states. The dynamics is\ntypically much simpler when the joint strength of reactions to the partner's\nstate is stronger than for their own states. Moreover, we have found that\nmultiple stability switches are possible only in the case of such relationships\nin which one of the partners reacts with delay on their own state.

Two\nmechanisms are thought to contribute to the ejection of runaway stars, both\ninvolve binarity (or higher multiplicity). In the binary supernova scenario a\nrunaway star receives its velocity when its binary massive companion explodes\nas a supernova (SN). In the alternative dynamical ejection scenario, runaway\nstars are formed through gravitational interactions between stars and binaries\nin dense, compact clusters or cluster cores. Here we study the ejection\nscenario. We make use of extensive N-body simulations of massive clusters, as\nwell as analytic arguments, in order to to characterize the expected ejection\nvelocity distribution of runaways stars. We find the ejection velocity\ndistribution of the fastest runaways (>~80 km s^-1) depends on the binary\ndistribution in the cluster, consistent with our analytic toy model, whereas\nthe distribution of lower velocity runaways appears independent of the binaries\nproperties. For a realistic log constant distribution of binary separations, we\nfind the velocity distribution to follow a simple power law; Gamma(v) goes like\nv^(-8/3) for the high velocity runaways and v^(-3/2) for the low velocity ones.\nWe calculate the total expected ejection rates of runaway stars from our\nsimulated massive clusters and explore their mass function and their binarity.\nThe mass function of runaway stars is biased towards high masses, and depends\nstrongly on their velocity. The binarity of runaways is a decreasing function\nof their ejection velocity, with no binaries expected to be ejected with v>150\nkm s^-1.

Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in\nexplaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the\nproduction of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture\nof free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is\na natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of\nwide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with\n10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find\nthat planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,\nand have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6\nx (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties\n(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency\nis comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar\ndependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the\nspecific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass\ncan be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,\nand for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More\nthan one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be\ncaptured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing\nplanetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these\nformed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black\nholes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture\nof stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.\nFinally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a\nFFP-binary system with no stellar host.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In our prior work we observed that a negative side effect\nfor merchants using Groupons is that, on average, their Yelp ratings decline\nsignificantly. However, this previous work was essentially observational,\nrather than explanatory. In this work, we rigorously consider and evaluate\nvarious hypotheses about underlying consumer and merchant behavior in order to\nunderstand this phenomenon, which we dub the Groupon effect. We use statistical\nanalysis and mathematical modeling, leveraging a dataset we collected spanning\ntens of thousands of daily deals and over 7 million Yelp reviews. In\nparticular, we investigate hypotheses such as whether Groupon subscribers are\nmore critical than their peers, or whether some fraction of Groupon merchants\nprovide significantly worse service to customers using Groupons. We suggest an\nadditional novel hypothesis: reviews from Groupon subscribers are lower on\naverage because such reviews correspond to real, unbiased customers, while the\nbody of reviews on Yelp contain some fraction of reviews from biased or even\npotentially fake sources. Although we focus on a specific question, our work\nprovides broad insights into both consumer and merchant behavior within the\ndaily deals marketplace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 21:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

A random billiard with\nmicrostructure (RBM) is a random billiard for which P is derived from a choice\nof geometric/mechanical structure on the boundary of the billiard domain. RBMs\nprovide simple and explicit mechanical models of particle-surface interaction\nthat can incorporate thermal effects and permit a detailed study of\nthermostatic action from the perspective of the standard theory of Markov\nchains on general state spaces.\n  We focus on the operator P itself and how it relates to the\nmechanical/geometric features of the microstructure, such as mass ratios,\ncurvatures, and potentials. The main results are as follows: (1) we\ncharacterize the stationary probabilities (equilibrium states) of P and show\nhow standard equilibrium distributions studied in classical statistical\nmechanics, such as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and the Knudsen cosine\nlaw, arise naturally as generalized invariant billiard measures; (2) we obtain\nsome basic functional theoretic properties of P.

In classical\nphysics, this entropy is believed to be the logarithm of the volume of phase\nspace accessible to an isolated system [1]. There is no quantum mechanical\nanalog to this. Instead, Von Neumann's hypothesis for the entropy [2] is most\nwidely used. However this gives zero for systems with a known wave function,\nthat is a pure state. This is because it measures the lack of information about\nthe system rather than the flow of heat as obtained from thermodynamic\nexperiments. Many arguments attempt to sidestep these issues by considering the\nsystem of interest coupled to a large external one, unlike the classical case\nwhere Boltzmann's approach for isolated systems is far more satisfactory. With\nnew experimental techniques, probing the quantum nature of thermalization is\nnow possible [3, 4]. Here, using recent advances in our understanding of\nquantum thermalization [5-10] we show how to obtain the entropy as is measured\nfrom thermodynamic experiments, solely from the self-entanglement of the\nwavefunction, and find strong numerical evidence that the two are in agreement\nfor non-integrable systems.

Since\nshort-range wakefield effects are included analytically, the approach can be\nmuch more efficient than ordinary (non-IGF) approaches in situations where the\nwake function and charge density have disparate spatial scales. Two cases are\npresented: one derived from the full wake including short-range effects, and\none derived from the asymptotic wake. In the latter case the algorithm contains\nthe same physics as others based on the asymptotic approximation, but requires\nonly the line charge density and not its derivative.

However,\nwith the trend towards large-scale IT systems, a new challenge has emerged. The\ncomplexity of IT systems is becoming an obstacle that hampers the\nmanageability, operability, and maintainability of modern computing\ninfrastructures. Autonomic computing popped up to provide an answer to these\never-growing pitfalls. Fundamentally, autonomic systems are self-configuring,\nself-healing, self-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate\nall complex IT processes without human intervention. This paper proposes an\nautonomic HTML web-interface generator based on XML Schema and Style Sheet\nspecifications for self-configuring graphical user interfaces of web\napplications. The goal of this autonomic generator is to automate the process\nof customizing GUI web-interfaces according to the ever-changing business\nrules, policies, and operating environment with the least IT labor involvement.\nThe conducted experiments showed a successful automation of web interfaces\ncustomization that dynamically self-adapts to keep with the always-changing\nbusiness requirements. Future research can improve upon the proposed solution\nso that it supports the selfconfiguring of not only web applications but also\ndesktop applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2012 10:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

Then, a more general formulation of the above scaling properties allows to\nextend the model to the afternoon trading session. We finally outline an\napplication in which conditioned forecasting is used to implement a\ntrend-following trading strategy capable of exploiting linear correlations\npresent in the S&P dataset and absent in the model. Trading signals are\nmodel-based and not derived from chartist criteria. In-sample and out-of-sample\ntests indicate that the model-based trading strategy performs better than a\nbenchmark one established on an asymmetric GARCH process, and show the\nexistence of small arbitrage opportunities. We remark that in the absence of\nlinear correlations the trading profit would vanish and discuss why the trading\nstrategy is potentially interesting to hedge volatility risk for S&P\nindex-based products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2012 14:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 09:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-16"}

This is a natural framework to model, e.g.,\nheterogeneity in susceptibility or infectivity of individuals. We review, along\nwith the necessary theory, the results obtained using the discussed approach.\nIn particular, we formulate and analyze an SIR model with distributed\nsusceptibility and infectivity, showing that the epidemiological models for\nclosed populations are well suited to the suggested framework. A number of\nknown results from the literature is derived, including the final epidemic size\nequation for an SIR model with distributed susceptibility. It is proved that\nthe bottom up approach of the theory of heterogeneous populations with\nparametric heterogeneity allows to infer the population level description,\nwhich was previously used without a firm mechanistic basis; in particular, the\npower law transmission function is shown to be a consequence of the initial\ngamma distributed susceptibility and infectivity. We discuss how the general\ntheory can be applied to the modeling goals to include the heterogeneous\ncontact population structure and provide analysis of an SI model with\nheterogeneous contacts. We conclude with a number of open questions and\npromising directions, where the theory of heterogeneous populations can lead to\nimportant simplifications and generalizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2012 15:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

Explicitly, we present a\nnovel algorithm for recognition and classifications of facial images based on\napplying 2DPCA to a 2D representation of the Histogram of oriented gradients\n(2D-HOG) which maintains the spatial relation between pixels of the input\nimages. This algorithm allows a compact representation of the images which\nreduces the computational complexity and the storage requirments, while\nmaintaining the highest reported recognition accuracy. This promotes this\nmethod for usage with very large datasets. Large dataset was collected for\npeople in Hajj. Experimental results employing ORL, UMIST, JAFFE, and HAJJ\ndatasets confirm these excellent properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2012 15:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

A problem is that defining scene\ndescriptions through these procedures usually requires a knowledge in formal\nlanguage grammars, programming theory and manually editing textual files using\na strict syntax, making it less intuitive to use. Luckily, graphical user\ninterfaces has made a lot of tasks on computers easier to perform and out of\nthe belief that creating computer programs can also be one of them, visual\nprogramming languages (VPLs) have emerged. The goal in VPLs is to shift more\nwork from the programmer to the integrated development environment (IDE),\nmaking programming an user-friendlier task.\n  In this thesis, an approach of using a VPL for defining procedures that\nautomatically generate virtual scenes is presented. The methods required to\nbuild a VPL are presented, including a novel method of generating readable code\nin a structured programming language. Also, the methods for achieving basic\nprinciples of VPLs will be shown -- suitable visual presentation of information\nand guiding the programmer in the right direction using constraints. On the\nother hand, procedural generation methods are presented in the context of\nvisual programming -- adapting the application programming interface (API) of\nthese methods to better serve the user. The main focus will be on the methods\nfor urban modeling, such as building, city layout and details generation with\nrandom number generation used to create non-deterministic scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 16:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-15"}
