While this is a\nproblem of importance in several contexts -- offline and online social\nnetworks, e-commerce, epidemiology, vulnerabilities in infrastructure networks\n-- there has been very little work, analytical or empirical, on finding the\ngraph. Clearly, it is impossible to do so from just one cascade; our interest\nis in learning the graph from a small number of cascades.\n  For the classic and popular \"independent cascade\" SIR epidemics, we\nanalytically establish the number of cascades required by both the global\nmaximum-likelihood (ML) estimator, and a natural greedy algorithm. Both results\nare based on a key observation: the global graph learning problem decouples\ninto $n$ local problems -- one for each node. For a node of degree $d$, we show\nthat its neighborhood can be reliably found once it has been infected $O(d^2\n\\log n)$ times (for ML on general graphs) or $O(d\\log n)$ times (for greedy on\ntrees). We also provide a corresponding information-theoretic lower bound of\n$\\Omega(d\\log n)$; thus our bounds are essentially tight. Furthermore, if we\nare given side-information in the form of a super-graph of the actual graph (as\nis often the case), then the number of cascade samples required -- in all cases\n-- becomes independent of the network size $n$.\n  Finally, we show that for a very general SIR epidemic cascade model, the\nMarkov graph of infection times is obtained via the moralization of the network\ngraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 17:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-09"}

Under the assumption\nthat mm-wave emission of disks is mostly optically thin, these data have been\ngenerally interpreted as evidence for the presence of mm/cm-sized pebbles in\nthe disk outer regions. In this work we investigate the effect of possible\nlocal optically thick regions on the mm-wave emission of protoplanetary disks\nwithout mm/cm-sized grains. A significant local increase of the optical depth\nin the disk can be caused by the concentration of solid particles, as predicted\nto result from a variety of proposed physical mechanisms. We calculate the\nfilling factors and implied overdensities these optically thick regions would\nneed to significantly affect the millimeter fluxes of disks, and we discuss\ntheir plausibility. We find that optically thick regions characterized by\nrelatively small filling factors can reproduce the mm-data of young disks\nwithout requesting emission from mm/cm-sized pebbles. However, these optically\nthick regions require dust overdensities much larger than what predicted by any\nof the physical processes proposed in the literature to drive the concentration\nof solids. We find that only for the most massive disks it is possible and\nplausible to imagine that the presence of optically thick regions in the disk\nis responsible for the low measured values of the mm spectral index. For the\nmajority of the disk population, optically thin emission from a population of\nlarge mm-sized grains remains the most plausible explanation.

We quantify the spatial\ndistribution with the half-light radius. The median Halpha effective radius\nr_e(Halpha) is 4.2+-0.1 kpc but the sizes span a large range, from compact\nobjects with r_e(Halpha) ~ 1.0 kpc to extended disks with r_e(Halpha) ~ 15 kpc.\nComparing Halpha sizes to continuum sizes, we find\n<r_e(Halpha)/r_e(R)>=1.3+-0.1 for the full sample. That is, star formation, as\ntraced by Halpha, typically occurs out to larger radii than the rest-frame\nR-band stellar continuum; galaxies are growing their radii and building up from\nthe inside out.

Thus, constraining the near-core conditions in\nthis class of stars can place tighter constraints on the size, mass and\nchemical composition of supernova remnants. Asteroseismology of these massive\nstars is one possible approach into such investigations. Recently, Moravveji et\nal. (2012, hereafter Paper I) extracted 19 significant frequencies from a\n6-year radial velocity monitoring or Rigel (\\beta Ori, B8 Ia). The periods they\ndetermined broadly range from 1.22 to 74.74 days. Based on our differentially\nrotating stellar structure and evolution model, Rigel, at it's current\nevolutionary state, is undergoing core He burning and shell H burning. Linear\nfully non-adiabatic non-radial stability analyses result in the excitation of a\ndense spectrum of non-radial gravity-dominated mixed modes. The fundamental\nradial mode (\\ell=0) and its overtones are all stable. When the hydrogen\nburning shell is located even partially in the radiative zone, a favorable\ncondition for destabilization of g-modes through the so-called\n\\epsilon-mechanism becomes viable. Only those g-modes that have high relative\namplitudes in the hydrogen burning (radiative) zone can survive the strong\nradiative damping. From the entire observed range of variability periods of\nRigel (found in Paper I), and based on our model, only those modes with periods\nranging between 21 to 127 days can be theoretically explained by the\n\\epsilon-mechanism. The origin of the short-period variations (found in Paper\nI) still remain unexplained. Because Rigel is similar to other massive BA\nsupergiants, we believe that the \\epsilon-mechanism may be able to explain the\nlong-period variations in \\alpha Cygni class of pulsating stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 21:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-08"}

Opacity-corrected images of the\nnearest external galaxies have been used to form a robust z=0 distribution\nfunction of HI, f(N_HI,X,z=0), the probability of encountering a specific HI\ncolumn density per unit comoving distance. This is contrasted with previously\npublished determinations of f(N_HI,X) at z=1 and 3. A systematic decline of\nmoderate column density (18<log(N_HI)<21) HI is observed that corresponds to a\ndecline in surface area of such gas by a factor of five since z=3. The number\nof equivalent DLA absorbers (log(N_HI)>20.3) has also declined systematically\nover this redshift interval by a similar amount, while the cosmological mass\ndensity in such systems has declined by only a factor of two to its current,\nopacity corrected value of Omega_HI^DLA(z=0) = 5.4 +/- 0.9x10^-4.\n  We utilize the tight, but strongly non-linear dependence of 21cm absorption\nopacity on column density at z=0 to transform our HI images into ones of 21cm\nabsorption opacity. These images are used to calculate distribution and\npathlength functions of integrated 21cm opacity. The incidence of deep 21cm\nabsorption systems is predicted to show very little evolution with redshift,\nwhile that of faint absorbers should decline by a factor of five between z=3\nand the present.

To investigate this issue, in this paper\nwe study the photospheric compositions of a sample of Herbig Ae and Be stars,\nwhich are considered to be the pre-main sequence progenitors of A and B stars.\nWe have performed a detailed abundance analysis of 20 Herbig stars (three of\nwhich have confirmed magnetic fields), and one dusty young star.

The incidence of lambda Boo chemical\npeculiarities we find in Herbig stars is much higher than what is seen on the\nmain sequence. We argue that a selective accretion model for lambda Boo star\nformation is a natural explanation for the remarkably large number of lambda\nBoo stars in our sample. We also find that the magnetic Herbig stars do not\nexhibit a range of chemical compositions remarkably different from the normal\nstars: one magnetic star displays lambda Boo chemical peculiarities (HD\n101412), one displays weak Ap/Bp peculiarities (V380 Ori A), and one (HD\n190073) is chemically normal. This is completely different from what is seen on\nthe main sequence, where all magnetic A and cool B stars show Ap/Bp chemical\npeculiarities, and this is consistent with the idea that the magnetic field\nprecedes the formation of the chemical peculiarities typical of Ap and Bp\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 21:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

I argue that the Meissner\neffect in superconductors necessitates the existence of an electrostatic field\nin their interior, originating in the expulsion of negative charge from the\ninterior to the surface when a metal becomes superconducting. The theory of\nhole superconductivity predicts this physics, and associated with it a\nmacroscopic spin current in the ground state of superconductors (\"Spin Meissner\neffect\"), qualitatively different from what is predicted by conventional\nBCS-London theory. A new London-like electrodynamic description of\nsuperconductors is proposed to describe this physics. Within this theory\nsuperconductivity is driven by lowering of quantum kinetic energy, the fact\nthat the Coulomb repulsion strongly depends on the character of the charge\ncarriers, namely whether electron- or hole-like, and the spin-orbit\ninteraction. The electron-phonon interaction does not play a significant role,\nyet the existence of an isotope effect in many superconductors is easily\nunderstood. In the strong coupling regime the theory appears to favor local\ncharge inhomogeneity. The theory is proposed to apply to all superconducting\nmaterials, from the elements to the high $T_c$ cuprates and pnictides, is\nhighly falsifiable, and explains a wide variety of experimental observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2012 22:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}

We have studied ~50,000 M dwarfs from the SDSS\nStripe 82 area, and 1,321 M dwarfs from the 2MASS Calibration Scan Point Source\nWorking Database that overlap SDSS imaging fields. We assign photometric\nspectral types from M0 to M6 using (r-i) and (i-z) colors for every star in our\nsample. Stripe 82 stars each have 50-100 epochs of data, while 2MASS\nCalibration stars have ~1900 epochs. From these data we estimate the observed\nrates and theoretical detection thresholds for flares in eight photometric\nbands as a function of spectral type. Optical flare rates are found to be in\nagreement with previous studies, while the frequency per hour of NIR flare\ndetections is found to be more than two orders of magnitude lower. An excess of\nsmall amplitude flux increases in all bands exhibits a power-law distribution,\nwhich we interpret as the result of flares below our detection thresholds. In\norder to investigate the recovery efficiency for flares in each filter, we\nextend a two-component flare model into the NIR. Quiescent M0-M6 spectral\ntemplates were used with the model to predict the photometric response of\nflares from u to Ks. We determine that red optical filters are sensitive to\nflares with u-band amplitudes >2 mag, and NIR filters to flares with delta\nu>4.5 mag. Our model predicts that M0 stars have the best color-contrast for\nJ-band detections, but M4-M6 stars should show the highest rate of NIR flares\nwith amplitudes of delta J ~0.01 mag.

In particular, considering any\n(sufficiently regular) gluon propagator D(p^2) and the one-loop-corrected ghost\npropagator G(p^2), we prove in the 2d case that sigma(p^2) blows up in the\ninfrared limit p -> 0 as -D(0)\\ln(p^2). Thus, for d=2, the no-pole condition\n\\sigma(p^2) < 1 (for p^2 > 0) can be satisfied only if D(0) = 0. On the\ncontrary, in d=3 and 4, sigma(p^2) is finite also if D(0) > 0. The same results\nare obtained by evaluating G(p^2) explicitly at one loop, using fitting forms\nfor D(p^2) that describe well the numerical data of D(p^2) in d=2,3,4 in the\nSU(2) case. These evaluations also show that, if one considers the coupling\nconstant g^2 as a free parameter, G(p^2) admits a one-parameter family of\nbehaviors (labelled by g^2), in agreement with Boucaud et al. In this case the\ncondition sigma(0) <= 1 implies g^2 <= g^2_c, where g^2_c is a 'critical'\nvalue. Moreover, a free-like G(p^2) in the infrared limit is obtained for any\nvalue of g^2 < g^2_c, while for g^2 = g^2_c one finds an infrared-enhanced\nG(p^2). Finally, we analyze the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for sigma(p^2)\nand show that, for infrared-finite ghost-gluon vertices, one can bound\nsigma(p^2). Using these bounds we find again that only in the d=2 case does one\nneed to impose D(0) = 0 in order to satisfy the no-pole condition. The d=2\nresult is also supported by an analysis of the DSE using a spectral\nrepresentation for G(p^2). Thus, if the no-pole condition is imposed, solving\nthe d=2 DSE cannot lead to a massive behavior for D(p^2). These results apply\nto any Gribov copy inside the so-called first Gribov horizon, i.e. the 2d\nresult D(0) = 0 is not affected by Gribov noise. These findings are also in\nagreement with lattice data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 08:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

It is clear that these statistics\nassess the three-point correlations between galaxy positions and projected\nmatter density. For future applications of these novel statistics, we aim at a\nmore intuitive understanding of G3L to isolate the main features that possibly\ncan be measured. We construct a toy model (\"isolated lens model\"; ILM) for the\ndistribution of galaxies and associated matter to determine the measured\nquantities of the two G3L correlation functions and traditional galaxy-galaxy\nlensing (GGL) in a simplified context. The ILM presumes single lens galaxies to\nbe embedded inside arbitrary matter haloes that, however, are statistically\nindependent (\"isolated\") from any other halo or lens position. In the ILM, the\naverage mass-to-galaxy number ratio of clusters of any size cannot change. GGL\nand galaxy clustering alone cannot distinguish an ILM from any more complex\nscenario. The lens-lens-shear correlator in combination with second-order\nstatistics enables us to detect deviations from a ILM, though. This can be\nquantified by a difference signal defined in the paper.

From numerical simulations, its evolution since bar formation is\ntightly linked to the dark halo in which the bar is formed through dynamical\nfriction and angular momentum exchange. Observational measurements of the bar\npattern speed with redshift can restrict models of galaxy formation and bar\nevolution. We aim to determine, for the first time, the bar pattern speed\nevolution with redshift based on morphological measurements. We have selected a\nsample of 44 low inclination ringed galaxies from the SDSS and COSMOS surveys\ncovering the redshift range 0 <z< 0.8 to investigate the evolution of the bar\npattern speed. We have derived morphological ratios between the deprojected\nouter ring radius (R_{ring}) and the bar size (R_{bar}). This quantity is\nrelated to the parameter {\\cal R}=R_{CR}/R_{bar} used for classifiying bars in\nslow and fast rotators, and allow us to investigate possible differences with\nredshift. We obtain a similar distribution of $R$ at all redshifts. We do not\nfind any systematic effect that could be forcing this result. The results\nobtained here are compatible with both, the bulk of the bar population (~70%)\nbeing fast-rotators and no evolution of the pattern speed with redshift. We\nargue that if bars are long-lasting structures, the results presented here\nimply that there has not been a substantial angular momentum exchange between\nthe bar and halo, as predicted by numerical simulations. In consequence, this\nmight imply that the discs of these high surface-brightness galaxies are\nmaximal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 09:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The sign of $\\Lambda$ provides a criterion for the transition\nbetween the Brazil-nut effect (BNE) and the reverse Brazil-nut effect (RBNE).\nThe present theory incorporates two extra ingredients not accounted for by the\nprevious theoretical attempt. First, the theory is based upon the second Sonine\napproximation to the transport coefficients of the mass flux of intruder.\nSecond, the dependence of the temperature ratio (intruder temperature over that\nof the host granular gas) on the solid volume fraction is taken into account in\nthe first and second Sonine approximations. In order to check the accuracy of\nthe Sonine approximation considered, the Enskog equation is also numerically\nsolved by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to get the\nkinetic diffusion coefficient $D_0$. The comparison between theory and\nsimulation shows that the second Sonine approximation to $D_0$ yields an\nimprovement over the first Sonine approximation when the intruder is lighter\nthan the gas particles in the range of large inelasticity. With respect to the\nform of the phase diagrams for the BNE/RBNE transition, the kinetic theory\nresults for the factor $\\Lambda$ indicate that while the form of these diagrams\ndepends sensitively on the order of the Sonine approximation considered when\ngravity is absent, no significant differences between both Sonine solutions\nappear in the opposite limit (gravity dominates the thermal gradient). In the\nformer case (no gravity), the first Sonine approximation overestimates both the\nRBNE region and the influence of dissipation on thermal diffusion segregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 10:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-02"}

First, we use\nlogistic regressions to fit and extrapolate the HDI on a country level as a\nfunction of time. This is mainly motivated by the fact that the HDI is bounded\nbetween 0 and 1 and that it decelerates as it approaches 1. Second, we employ\nfor individual countries the correlations between CO2 per capita emissions and\nHDI in order to extrapolate their emissions. This is an ergodic assumption.\nThird, we let countries with incomplete data records evolve similarly as their\nclose neighbors (in the emissions-HDI plane, see Fig. 1 in the main text) with\ncomplete time series of CO2 per capita emissions and HDI. Country-based\nemissions estimates are obtained by multiplying extrapolated CO2 per capita\nvalues by population numbers of three scenarios extracted from the Millennium\nEcosystem Assessment report. Finally, we propose a reduction scheme, where\ncountries with an HDI above the development threshold reduce their per capita\nCO2 emissions with a rate that is proportional to their HDI.

Specifically, let $X_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$ summarize\nthe factors of the $i$-th unit. Then one could think of a model equation $Y_i =\nf_o(X_i) + \\epsilon_i$ with a regression function $f_o : \\mathcal{X} \\to\n\\mathbb{R}$ describing the unavoidable influence of the factors $X_i$ and\n$\\epsilon_i$ being the adjusted performance of the $i$-th unit. Now a common\nproposal is to estimate $f_o$ via regression methods by a function $\\hat{f}$\ndepending on the current data $(X_i,Y_i)$, possibly augmented by additional\npast data, and to use the residuals $\\hat{\\epsilon}_i := Y_i - \\hat{f}(X_i)$ as\nsurrogates for the adjusted performances $\\epsilon_i$. In the present report we\ndiscuss this approach, its potential pitfalls and (mis)interpretation. In\nparticular, an unavoidable property of the residuals $\\hat{\\epsilon}_i$ is that\nthey measure only parts of the adjusted performance while the remaining parts\nget hidden in the estimated function $\\hat{f}$.

The corresponding\nstatistical characterization of such effects is done in physical space using\nstructure functions, as well as in spectral space with spectra of two-point\ncorrelations, providing two complementary viewpoints. In this framework,\nsecond-order and third-order structure functions are put in parallel with\nspectra of two-point second- and third-order velocity correlation functions,\nusing passage relations. Such relations apply in the isotropic case, or for\nisotropically averaged statistics, which, however, do not reflect the actual\nmore complex structure of anisotropic turbulence submitted to rotation or\nstratification. This complexity is demonstrated in this paper by\norientation-dependent energy and energy transfer spectra produced in both cases\nby means of a two-point statistical model for axisymmetric turbulence. We show\nthat, to date, the anisotropic formalism used in the spectral transfer\nstatistics is especially well-suited to analyze the refined dynamics of\nanisotropic homogeneous turbulence, and that it can help in the analysis of\nisotropically computed third-order structure function statistics often used to\ncharacterize anisotropic contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 13:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-10"}

Nested pushdown\ntrees are useful representations of control flows in the verification of\nprograms with recursive calls of first-order functions. Higher-order nested\npushdown trees are expansions of unfoldings of graphs generated by higher-order\npushdown systems. Moreover, the class of nested pushdown trees of level n is\nuniformly first-order interpretable in the class of collapsible pushdown graphs\nof level n+1. The relationship between the class of higher-order pushdown\ngraphs and the class of collapsible higher-order pushdown graphs is not very\nwell understood. We hope that the further study of the nested pushdown tree\nhierarchy leads to a better understanding of these two hierarchies. In this\npaper, we are concerned with the first-order model checking problem on\nhigher-order nested pushdown trees. We show that the first-order model checking\non the first two levels of this hierarchy is decidable. Moreover, we obtain an\n2-EXPSPACE algorithm for the class of nested pushdown trees of level 1.

We show that\nthe spectrally resolved dynamics is in agreement with an excitonic origin for\nthe inner-ring which is formed due to a local heating of indirect excitons by\nthe laser excitation. To confirm this interpretation and exclude the ionization\nof indirect excitons, we evaluate the excitonic density that is extracted from\nthe energy of the photoluminescence emission. It is shown that optically\ninjected carriers play a crucial role in that context as these are trapped in\nour field-effect device and then vary the electrostatic potential controlling\nthe confinement of indirect excitons.

However, it suppressed by smoothing\nthe electrostatic environment of the double quantum well by placing the latter\nbehind a super-lattice.

The existing schemes consider homogeneous\nsensor networks which have poor performance and scalability. Due to many-to-one\ntraffic pattern, sensors may communicate with small portion of its neighbours.\nKey management is the critical process in sensor nodes to secure the data. Most\nexisting schemes establish shared keys for all the sensors no matter whether\nthey are communicating or not. Hence it leads to large storage overhead.\nAnother problem in sensor network is compromised node attack and denial of\nservice attack which occurs because of its wireless nature. Existing multi path\nrouting algorithms are vulnerable to these attacks. So once an adversary\nacquires the routing algorithm, it can compute the same routes known to the\nsource, and hence endanger all information sent over these routes. If an\nadversary performs node compromise attack, they can easily get the encryption/\ndecryption keys used by that node and hence they can intercept the information\neasily. In this paper we are proposing a key management scheme which only\nestablishes shared keys with their communicating neighbour and a mechanism to\ngenerate randomized multipath routes for secure transmission of data to the\nsink. Here we are adopting heterogeneous sensor networks and we are utilizing\nelliptic curve cryptography for efficient key management which is more\nefficient, scalable, and highly secure and reduces communication overhead. The\nroutes generated by our mechanism are highly dispersive, energy efficient and\nmaking them quite capable of bypassing the back holes at low energy cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 15:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-10"}

We\nassume the transmission power of each node is a function of the local channel\nstate, local data queue state and local energy queue state only. In turn, we\nconsider two delay optimization formulations, namely the decentralized\npartially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) and Non-cooperative\npartially observable stochastic game (POSG). In DEC-POMDP formulation, we\nderive a decentralized online learning algorithm to determine the control\nactions and Lagrangian multipliers (LMs) simultaneously, based on the policy\ngradient approach. Under some mild technical conditions, the proposed\ndecentralized policy gradient algorithm converges almost surely to a local\noptimal solution.

This often results in erroneous parameter extraction,\nbringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the low-rate samples. In our\nwork, we achieve SNR enhancement, by beamforming the sub-Nyquist samples\nobtained from multiple elements. We refer to this process as \"compressed\nbeamforming\".
