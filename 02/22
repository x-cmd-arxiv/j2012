We\nfirst consider the case of a global perturbation, acting over the whole sample,\nand find evidence of a mean-field dynamical transition where the lattice gets\nstrongly distorted above a certain energy threshold, despite the weak strength\nof the electron-phonon coupling by comparison with the Hubbard repulsion. Next,\nwe address a slab geometry for a correlated heterostructure and study the\nrelaxation dynamics across the system when the perturbation acts locally on the\nfirst layer. While for weak deviations from equilibrium the excited surface is\nable to relax by transferring its excess energy to the bulk, for large\ndeviations the excess energy stays instead concentrated into the surface layer.\nThis self-trapping occurs both in the absence as well as in the presence of\nelectron-phonon coupling.

One of the directions we follow is to consider updated\nobservational samples. Our results indicate than conclusions on the main dark\nenergy features as drawn from this method are intimately related to the\nfeatures of the samples themselves (which are not quite ideal). This is\nparticularly true of GRBs, which manifest themselves as poor performers in this\ncontext. In contrast to original works, we conclude they cannot be used for\ncosmological purposes, and the state of the art does not allow to regard them\non the same quality basis as SNeIa. The next direction we contribute to is the\nquestion of how the adjusting of some parameters (window width, overlap,\nselection criteria) affect the results. We find again there is a considerable\nsensitivity to these features. Then, we try to establish what is the current\nredshift range for which one can make solid predictions on dark energy\nevolution. Finally, we strengthen the former view that this model is modest in\nthe sense it provides only a picture of the global trend.

The approach\nis based upon a stochastic unraveling of the influence functional that appears\nin the imaginary time path integral formalism of quantum statistical mechanics.\nThis method is then applied to study the effects of thermal noise, static\ndisorder, and temperature on the coherence length in excitonic systems. As\nrepresentative examples of biased and unbiased systems, attention is focused on\nthe well-characterized light harvesting complexes of FMO and LH2, respectively.\nDue to the bias, FMO is completely localized in the site basis at low\ntemperatures, whereas LH2 is completely delocalized. In the latter, the\npresence of static disorder leads to a plateau in the coherence length at low\ntemperature that becomes increasingly pronounced with increasing strength of\nthe disorder. The introduction of noise, however, precludes this effect. In\nbiased systems, it is shown that the environment may increase the coherence\nlength, but only decrease that of unbiased systems. Finally it is emphasized\nthat for typical values of the environmental parameters in light harvesting\nsystems, the system and bath are entangled at equilibrium in the single\nexcitation manifold. That is, the density matrix cannot be described as a\nproduct state as is often assumed, even at room temperature. The reduced\ndensity matrix of LH2 is shown to be in precise agreement with the steady state\nlimit of previous exact quantum dynamics calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 17:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

If a game is to be\nplayed, it has to be played with objects and actions that have some physical\nexistence. We call such games playable. By focusing on the notion of\nplayability for games we can more clearly see the distinction between classical\nand quantum games and tackle the thorny issue of what it means to quantize a\ngame. The approach we take can more properly be thought of as gaming the\nquantum rather than quantizing a game and we find that in this perspective we\ncan think of a complete quantum game, for a given set of preferences, as\nrepresenting a single family of quantum games with many different playable\nversions. The versions of Quantum Prisoners Dilemma presented in the literature\ncan therefore be thought of specific instances of the single family of Quantum\nPrisoner's Dilemma with respect to a particular measurement. The conditions for\nequilibrium are given for playable quantum games both in terms of expected\noutcomes and a geometric approach.

This variety is a result of different\nphysical conditions affecting the ion currents through a cellular membrane. The\ntransmembrane currents are often considered by macroscopic membrane models as\nessentially a homogeneous process. However, this assumption is doubtful, since\nions move through ion channels, which are scattered within the membrane.\nAccounting for this fact, the present work proposes a theoretical model of\nheterogeneous membrane conductivity. The model is based on the hypothesis that\nboth potential and charge are distributed inhomogeneously on the membrane\nsurface, concentrated near channel pores, as the direct consequence of the\ninhomogeneous transmembrane current. A system of continuity equations having\nnon-stationary and quasi-stationary forms expresses this fact mathematically.\nThe present work performs mathematical analysis of the proposed equations,\nfollowing by the synthesis of the equivalent electric element of a\nheterogeneous membrane current. This element is further used to construct a\nmodel of the cell-surface electric junction in a form of the equivalent\nelectrical circuit. After that a study of how the heterogeneous membrane\nconductivity affects parameters of the extracellular electrical signal is\nperformed. As the result it was found that variation of the passive\ncharacteristics of the cell-surface junction, conductivity of the cleft and the\ncleft height, could lead to different shapes of the extracellular signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 17:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}

It is known that BCRs form oligomers\nupon encountering antigen, and that the size and rate of formation of these\noligomers increase with affinity.

This paper is dedicated to high-SNR\nanalysis of MIMO linear precoding. The Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) of\na number of linear precoders is analyzed. Furthermore, since the diversity at\nfinite rate (also known as the fixed-rate regime, corresponding to multiplexing\ngain of zero) does not always follow from the DMT, linear precoders are also\nanalyzed for their diversity at fixed rates. In several cases, the diversity at\nmultiplexing gain of zero is found not to be unique, but rather to depend on\nspectral efficiency. The analysis includes the zero-forcing (ZF), regularized\nZF, matched filtering and Wiener filtering precoders. We calculate the DMT of\nZF precoding under two common design approaches, namely maximizing the\nthroughput and minimizing the transmit power. It is shown that regularized ZF\n(RZF) or Matched filter (MF) suffer from error floors for all positive\nmultiplexing gains. However, in the fixed rate regime, RZF and MF precoding\nachieve full diversity up to a certain spectral efficiency and zero diversity\nat rates above it. When the regularization parameter in the RZF is optimized in\nthe MMSE sense, the structure is known as the Wiener precoder which in the\nfixed-rate regime is shown to have diversity that depends not only on the\nnumber of antennas, but also on the spectral efficiency.

The\norigin of the apparently chaotic and at the same time highly correlated\nmicroscopic response in plasticity remains hidden behind conventional\nengineering models which are based on smooth fitting functions. To regain\naccess to fluctuations, we study in this paper a minimal mesoscopic model whose\ngoal is to elucidate the origin of scale free behavior in plasticity. We limit\nour description to fcc type crystals and leave out both temperature and rate\neffects. We provide simple illustrations of the fact that complexity in rate\nindependent athermal plastic flows is due to marginal stability of the\nunderlying elastic system. Our conclusions are based on a reduction of an\nover-damped visco-elasticity problem for a system with a rugged elastic energy\nlandscape to an integer valued automaton. We start with an overdamped one\ndimensional model and show that it reproduces the main macroscopic\nphenomenology of rate independent plastic behavior but falls short of\ngenerating self similar structure of fluctuations. We then provide evidence\nthat a two dimensional model is already adequate for describing power law\nstatistics of avalanches and fractal character of dislocation patterning.

We show that\nthe physics of the FMR can be summarised as follows: for massive galaxies with\nstellar mass M_* >= 10^11 solar masses, ISM metal enrichment due to star\nformation is compensated by inflow of metal poor IGM gas, leading to a constant\nvalue of the gas metallicity with star formation rate (SFR); outflows are\nrendered negligible as a result of the large potential wells of these galaxies.\nOn the other hand, as a result of their smaller SFR, less massive galaxies\nproduce less heavy elements that are also more efficiently ejected due to their\nshallow potential wells; as a result, for a given M_*, the gas metallicity\ndecreases with SFR. For such galaxies, the outflow efficiency determines both\nthe slope, and the knee of the metallicity-SFR relation.

For the correct modeling of the resonance lines, which are\namong the key diagnostics of stellar mass-loss, the stellar wind clumping\nturned out to be very important. In order to incorporate clumping into\nradiative transfer calculation, 3-D models are required. Various properties of\nthe clumps may have strong impact on the resonance line formation and,\ntherefore, on the determination of empirical mass-loss rates. We incorporate\nthe 3-D nature of the stellar wind clumping into radiative transfer\ncalculations and investigate how different model parameters influence the\nresonance line formation. We develop a full 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode for inhomogeneous expanding stellar winds. The number density of clumps\nfollows the mass conservation. For the first time, realistic 3-D models that\ndescribe the dense as well as the tenuous wind components are used to model the\nformation of resonance lines in a clumped stellar wind. At the same time,\nnon-monotonic velocity fields are accounted for. The 3-D density and velocity\nwind inhomogeneities show very strong impact on the resonance line formation.\nThe different parameters describing the clumping and the velocity field results\nin different line strengths and profiles.

For the other two groups, the RASS emission has its origin as either\nan optically dull/X-ray bright AGN, or the blending of distinct X-ray sources.\nUsing SDSS-DR7 data, we confirm, for all groups, the presence of an r-band\nmagnitude gap between the seed elliptical and the second-rank galaxy. However,\nthe gap value depends, up to 0.5mag, on how one estimates the seed galaxy total\nflux, which is greatly underestimated when using SDSS (relative to Sersic)\nmagnitudes. This implies that many FGs may be actually missed when using SDSS\ndata, a fact that should be carefully taken into account when comparing the\nobserved number densities of FGs to the expectations from cosmological\nsimulations. The similarity in the properties of seed--FG and non-fossil\nellipticals, found in our previous study, extends to the sample of X-ray\nconfirmed FGs, indicating that bright ellipticals in FGs do not represent a\ndistinct population of galaxies. For one system, we also find that the velocity\ndistribution of faint galaxies is bimodal, possibly showing that the system\nformed through the merging of two groups. This undermines the idea that all\nselected FGs form a population of true fossils.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 01:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Important\ncharacteristics that are present in social networks include a power law degree\ndistribution, small diameter and large amounts of clustering; however, most\ncurrent network generators, such as the Chung Lu and Kronecker models, largely\nignore the clustering present in a graph and choose to focus on preserving\nother network statistics, such as the power law distribution. Models such as\nthe exponential random graph model have a transitivity parameter, but are\ncomputationally difficult to learn, making scaling to large real world networks\nintractable. In this work, we propose an extension to the Chung Lu ran- dom\ngraph model, the Transitive Chung Lu (TCL) model, which incorporates the notion\nof a random transitive edge. That is, with some probability it will choose to\nconnect to a node exactly two hops away, having been introduced to a 'friend of\na friend'. In all other cases it will follow the standard Chung Lu model,\nselecting a 'random surfer' from anywhere in the graph according to the given\ninvariant distribution. We prove TCL's expected degree distribution is equal to\nthe degree distribution of the original graph, while being able to capture the\nclustering present in the network. The single parameter required by our model\ncan be learned in seconds on graphs with millions of edges, while networks can\nbe generated in time that is linear in the number of edges. We demonstrate the\nperformance TCL on four real- world social networks, including an email dataset\nwith hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges, showing TCL\ngenerates graphs that match the degree distribution, clustering coefficients\nand hop plots of the original networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 01:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-23"}

The derived periods of these two\ncompanions are close to a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance. We have studied\nthe stability of the system using the osculating orbital elements as presented\nby Lee et al. Results indicate an orbit-crossing architecture exhibiting\nshort-term dynamical instabilities leading to the escape of one of the proposed\ncompanions. We have examined the system's underlying model parameter-space by\nfollowing a Monte Carlo approach and found an improved fit to the timing data.\nA study of the stability of our best-fitting orbits also indicates that the\nproposed system is generally unstable. If the observed anomalous timing\nvariations of the binary period is due to additional circumbinary companions,\nthen the resulting system should exhibit a long-term stable orbital\nconfiguration much different from the orbits suggested by Lee et al. We,\ntherefore, suggest that based on Newtonian-dynamical considerations, the\nproposed quadruple system cannot exist. To uncover the true nature of the\nobserved period variations of this system, we recommend future photometric\nfollow-up observations that could further constrain eclipse-timing variations\nand/or refine light-travel time models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 04:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The first term is isotropic over the Fermi surface, independent of\ndoping, and has the frequency and temperature dependence characteristic of a\nFermi liquid. The second term is anisotropic over the Fermi surface (vanishing\nat the same points as the superconducting energy gap), strongly varies with\ndoping (scaling roughly with $T_c$, the superconducting transition\ntemperature), and has the frequency and temperature dependence characteristic\nof a marginal Fermi liquid. Previously it has been shown this self-energy can\ndescribe a range of experimental data including angle-dependent\nmagnetoresistance (ADMR) and quasi-particle renormalisations determined from\nspecific heat, quantum oscillations, and angle-resolved photo-emission\nspectroscopy (ARPES). Without introducing new parameters and neglecting vertex\ncorrections we show that this model self-energy can give a quantitative\ndescription of the temperature and doping dependence of a range of reported\ntransport properties of Tl2201 samples.

The temperature dependence of the\nlatter two are particularly sensitive to the anisotropy of the scattering rate\nand to the shape of the Fermi surface.

Furthermore,\nthe variations of $n_{ch}$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions with respect to the\ncolliding energy and mass number can provide a potential probe for the\nformation of quark gluon plasma (QGP) in the laboratory.

The SN, first classified as a SN\nimpostor, slowly rose to a peak of M_V \\sim -17 in \\sim55 days. In contrast to\nthe \\sim2 magnitude increase in the v-band light curve from the first\nobservation until peak, the UV flux increased by >7 magnitudes.

We aim to determine absolute dimensions and abundances\nfor the solar-type detached eclipsing binary EF Aqr, and to perform a detailed\ncomparison with results from recent stellar evolutionary models. uvby-beta\nstandard photometry was obtained with the Stromgren Automatic Telescope. The\nbroadening function formalism was applied on spectra observed with HERMES at\nthe Mercator telescope in La Palma, to obtain radial velocity curves. Masses\nand radii with a precision of 0.6% and 1.0% respectively have been established\nfor both components of EF Aqr. The active 0.956 M_sol secondary shows star\nspots and strong Ca II H and K emission lines. The 1.224 M_sol primary shows\nsigns of activity as well, but at a lower level. An [Fe/H] abundance of\n0.00+-0.10 is derived with similar abundances for Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co,\nand Ni. Solar calibrated evolutionary models such as Yonsei-Yale,\nVictoria-Regina and BaSTI isochrones and evolutionary tracks are unable to\nreproduce EF Aqr, especially for the secondary, which is 9% larger and 400 K\ncooler than predicted. Models adopting significantly lower mixing length\nparameters l/H_p remove these discrepancies, as seen in other solar type\nbinaries. For the observed metallicity, Granada models with a mixing length of\nl/H_p=1.30 (primary) and 1.05 (secondary) reproduce both components at a common\nage of 1.5+-0.6 Gyr. Observations of EF Aqr suggests that magnetic activity,\nand its effect on envelope convection, is likely to be the cause of\ndiscrepancies in both radius and temperature, which can be removed by adjusting\nthe mixing length parameter of the models downwards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 08:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-28"}

Assuming that requests are\nindependent and identically distributed, general expressions of miss\nprobabilities for a single Random cache are provided as well as exact results\nfor specific popularity distributions.

Several models have so far been proposed to explain\nthis time delay, including fluctuations propagating through an accretion flow,\nspectral variations during coronal flares, Comptonisation in the extended hot\ncorona or a jet, or time-delays due to large-scale reflection from the\naccretion disc. In principle these models can be used to predict the shape of\nthe energy spectrum as well as the frequency-dependence of the time-lags,\nthrough the construction of energy-dependent response functions which map the\nemission as a function of time-delay in the system.

The\nprogenitors of the present-day asteroids formed in the Solar Nebula almost\ncontemporary to the giant planets. The actual process producing the first\ngeneration of asteroids is uncertain, strongly depending on the physical\ncharacteristics of the Solar Nebula, and the different scenarios produce very\ndiverse initial size-frequency distributions. In this work we investigate the\nimplications of the formation of Jupiter, plausibly the first giant planet to\nform, on the evolution of the primordial asteroid belt. The formation of\nJupiter triggered a short but intense period of primordial bombardment,\npreviously unaccounted for, which caused an early phase of enhanced collisional\nevolution in the asteroid belt. Our results indicate that this Jovian Early\nBombardment caused the erosion or the disruption of bodies smaller than a\nthreshold size, which strongly depends on the size-frequency distribution of\nthe primordial planetesimals. If the asteroid belt was dominated by\nplanetesimals less than 100 km in diameter, the primordial bombardment would\nhave caused the erosion of bodies smaller than 200 km in diameter. If the\nasteroid belt was instead dominated by larger planetesimals, the bombardment\nwould have resulted in the destruction of bodies as big as 500 km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 11:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-27"}

A non-zero\nparameter delta_{RR}^{13} can open the decay channel K -> e nu_tau and enhance\nR_K over its Standard-Model value. In the region of the parameter space probed\nby NA62 the contribution from a bino-stau loop diagram is numerically dominant\nand the mixing between left-handed and right-handed staus is important. For\nlarge values of the stau mixing angle theta_tau the commonly adopted mass\ninsertion approximation is not accurate. We therefore express the\nsupersymmetric contribution to R_K in terms of the mass of the lightest stau\neigenstate, the mixing angle theta_tau, and other relevant MSSM parameter such\nas tan(beta) and the charged-Higgs boson mass M_H and plot the parameter\nregions constrained by R_K. We further study to which extent R_K can be\ndepleted through MSSM contributions interfering destructively with the SM\namplitude for K -> e nu_e. This lepton-flavour conserving (LFC) mechanism\ninvolves the parameter combination |delta_{LL}^{13} delta_{RR}^{13}|, which can\nbe constrained with a naturalness consideration for the electron mass or with\nthe measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. The LFC\neffect on R_K is marginal, an NA62 measurement of R_K significantly below the\nStandard Model expectation would indicate physics beyond the MSSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 13:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-23"}

This gives\na direct access to the ground-state energy or, at finite temperatures, to the\nfree energy of the system as well as to other static physical quantities.\nElementary excitations of the system, on the other hand, are described within\nthe language of Green's functions, i.e. time- or frequency-dependent dynamic\nquantities which give a direct access to the linear response of the system\nsubjected to a weak time-dependent external perturbation. A typical example is\nangle-revolved photoemission spectroscopy which is linked to the\nsingle-electron Green's function. Since usually both, the static as well as the\ndynamic physical quantities, cannot be obtained exactly for lattice fermion\nmodels like the Hubbard model, one has to resort to approximations. Opposed to\nmore ad hoc treatments, variational principles promise to provide consistent\nand controlled approximations. Here, the Ritz principle and a generalized\nversion of the Ritz principle at finite temperatures for the static case on the\none hand and a dynamical variational principle for the single-electron Green's\nfunction or the self-energy on the other hand are introduced, discussed in\ndetail and compared to each other to show up conceptual similarities and\ndifferences. In particular, the construction recipe for non-perturbative\ndynamic approximations is taken over from the construction of static mean-field\ntheory based on the generalized Ritz principle. Within the two different\nframeworks, it is shown which types of approximations are accessible, and their\nrespective weaknesses and strengths are worked out.

In this work, we\npresent a modeling and computational framework for proliferating cell\npopulation undergoing symmetric cell division.

Thus, it allows for the consideration of division number\ndependent parameters as well as the direct comparison of the model prediction\nwith labeling experiments, e.g., performed with Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl\nester (CFSE).

We compute the\nleading order jet functions and find that the convolution integrals over the\nsoft fractions are logarithmically divergent. This divergency is the\nconsequence of the boost invariance and does not depend on the model of the\nsoft correlation function describing the soft spectator quarks. Using as\nexample a two-loop diagram we demonstrated that such a divergency corresponds\nto the overlap of the soft and collinear regions. As a result one obtains large\nrapidity logarithm which must be included in the correct factorization\nformalism. We conclude that a consistent description of the factorization for\n$F_{1}$ implies the end-point collinear divergencies in the hard and soft\nspectator contributions, i.e. convolution integrals with respect to collinear\nfractions are not well-defined. Such scenario can only be realized when the\ntwist-3 nucleon distribution amplitude has specific end-point behavior which\ndiffers from one expected from the evolution of the nucleon distribution\namplitude. Such behavior leads to the violation of the collinear factorization\nfor the hard spectator scattering contribution. We suggest that the soft\nspectator scattering and chiral symmetry breaking provide the mechanism\nresponsible for the violation of collinear factorization in case of form factor\n$F_{1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 15:44:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 10:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Each\n3-orientation gives rise to a unique edge coloring known as a Schnyder wood\nthat has proven powerful for various computing and combinatorics applications.\nWe consider natural Markov chains for sampling uniformly from the set of\n3-orientations. First, we study a \"triangle-reversing\" chain on the space of\n3-orientations of a fixed triangulation that reverses the orientation of the\nedges around a triangle in each move. It was shown previously that this chain\nconnects the state space and we show that (i) when restricted to planar\ntriangulations of maximum degree six, the Markov chain is rapidly mixing, and\n(ii) there exists a triangulation with high degree on which this Markov chain\nmixes slowly. Next, we consider an \"edge-flipping\" chain on the larger state\nspace consisting of 3-orientations of all planar triangulations on a fixed\nnumber of vertices. It was also shown previously that this chain connects the\nstate space and we prove that the chain is always rapidly mixing. The\ntriangle-reversing and edge-flipping Markov chains both arise in the context of\nsampling other combinatorial structures, such as Eulerian orientations and\ntriangulations of planar point sets, so our results here may shed light on the\nmixing rate of these related chains as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 15:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-23"}

The pump has no moving parts and consists of a thermal resistor\nplaced asymmetrically within a straight channel connecting two reservoirs.\nUsing numerical simulations, the net flow is studied as a function of channel\ngeometry, resistor location, vapor bubble strength, fluid viscosity, and\nsurface tension. Two major regimes of behavior are identified: axial and\nnon-axial. In the axial regime, the drive bubble either remains inside the\nchannel or continues to grow axially when it reaches the reservoir. In the\nnon-axial regime the bubble grows out of the channel and in all three\ndimensions while inside the reservoir. The net flow in the axial regime is\nparabolic with respect to the hydraulic diameter of the channel cross-section\nbut in the non-axial regime it is not. From numerical modeling, it is\ndetermined that the net flow is maximal when the axial regime crosses over to\nthe non-axial regime.

This is in contrast to\ntraditional compressed-sensing based scheme where such sparse-domain\ninformation is required a priori. We then design specific dependable scheme to\nwork with our compressed sensing based data transmission scheme to make our\nmeter reading reliable and secure.
