Previous\nworks have shown interesting tendencies, using analytical expressions with\nsimplified models. In the present study, a more elaborated physical model is\nconsidered. The influence of several parameters, depending on the reed\nproperties, the design of the instrument or the control operated by the player,\nare studied. Previous results on the influence of the reed resonance frequency\nare confirmed. New results concerning the simultaneous influence of two model\nparameters on oscillation threshold, regime selection and playing frequency are\npresented and discussed. The authors use a numerical continuation approach.\nNumerical continuation consists in following a given solution of a set of\nequations when a parameter varies. Considering the instrument as a dynamical\nsystem, the oscillation threshold problem is formulated as a path following of\nHopf bifurcations, generalizing the usual approach of the characteristic\nequation, as used in previous works. The proposed numerical approach proves to\nbe useful for the study of musical instruments.

Two main techniques are used to obtain precision Doppler\nmeasurements at optical wavelengths. The first approach is the gas cell method,\nwhich consists on the least-squares matching of the spectrum of Iodine\nimprinted on the spectrum of the star. The second method relies on the\nconstruction of a stabilized spectrograph externally calibrated in wavelength.\nThe most precise stabilized spectrometer in operation is HARPS, operated by ESO\nin La Silla Observatory/Chile. The Doppler measurements obtained with HARPS are\ntypically obtained using the Cross-Correlation Function technique (CCF). It\nconsists of multiplying the stellar spectrum with a weighted binary mask and\nfinding the minimum of such product as a function of the Doppler shift. It is\nknown that CCF is suboptimal in exploiting the Doppler information in the\nstellar spectrum. Here, we describe an algorithm to obtain precision RV\nmeasurements using least-squares matching of each observed spectrum to a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio template derived from the same observations. Such\nalgorithm is implemented in our software called HARPS-TERRA (Template Enhanced\nRadial velocity Re-analysis Application). New radial velocity measurements on a\nrepresentative sample of stars observed by HARPS is used to illustrate the\nbenefits of the proposed method.

The {\\beta} Pictoris system with its debris disk and a massive giant\nplanet orbiting at \\simeq 9 AU represents an ideal laboratory to study giant\nplanet formation and evolution as well as planet-disk interactions. {\\beta} Pic\nb can also help testing brightness-mass relations at young ages. Other planets,\nyet undetected, may of course be present in the system. Aims. We aim at putting\ndirect constrains on the mass of {\\beta} Pic b and at searching for additional\njovian planets on orbits closer than typically 2 AU. Methods. We use high\nprecision Harps data collected over 8 years since 2003 to measure and analyse\n{\\beta} Pic radial velocities. Results. We show that the true mass of {\\beta}\nPic b is less than 10, 12, 15.5, 20 and 25 MJup if orbiting respectively at 8,\n9, 10, 11 and 12 AU.

We also\nexclude the presence of giant planets more massive than 2.5 MJup with periods\nless than 100 days (hot Jupiters), more massive than 9 MJup for periods in the\nrange 100-500 days.

These observations\nset constraints on our theoretical notion of the slow neutron capture process\n(s process) that occurs inside intermediate-mass AGB stars. Lithium (Li)\nabundances are also reported for these stars. In intermediate-mass AGB stars,\nLi can be produced by proton captures occuring at the base of the convective\nenvelope. For this reason the observations of Rb, Zr, and Li set complementary\nconstraints on different processes occurring in the same stars. We present\npredictions for the abundances of Rb, Zr, and Li as computed for the first time\nsimultaneously in intermediate-mass AGB star models and compare them to the\ncurrent observational constraints. We find that the Rb abundance increases with\nincreasing stellar mass, as is inferred from observations but we are unable to\nmatch the highest observed [Rb/Fe] abundances. Inclusion of a partial mixing\nzone (PMZ) to activate the 13C(a,n)16O reaction as an additional neutron source\nyields significant enhancements in the Rb abundance. However this leads to Zr\nabundances that exceed the upper limits of the current observational\nconstraints. If the third dredge-up (TDU) efficiency remains as high during the\nfinal stages of AGB evolution as during the earlier stages, we can match the\nlowest values of the observed Rb abundance range. We predict large variations\nin the Li abundance, which are observed. Finally, the predicted Rb production\nincreases with decreasing metallicity, in qualitative agreement with\nobservations of Magellanic Cloud AGB stars. However stellar models of Z=0.008\nand Z=0.004 intermediate-mass AGB stars do not produce enough Rb to match the\nobserved abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 04:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

For inventory problems, we obtain a new\nexact algorithm for the economic lot-sizing problem with general concave\nordering costs, and a 4-approximation algorithm for the joint replenishment\nproblem with general concave individual ordering costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 08:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

This\nyoung planet offers the rare opportunity to monitor a large fraction of the\norbit using the imaging technique over a reasonably short timescale. Using the\nNAOS-CONICA adaptive-optics instrument (NACO) at the Very Large Telescope\n(VLT), we obtained repeated follow-up images of the Bpic system in the Ks and\nL' filters at four new epochs in 2010 and 2011. Complementing these data with\nprevious measurements, we conduct a homogeneous analysis, which covers more\nthan eight yrs, to accurately monitor the Bpic b position relative to the star.\nOn the basis of the evolution of the planet's relative position with time, we\nderive the best-fit orbital solutions for our measurements. More reliable\nresults are found with a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach. The solutions favor\na low-eccentricity orbit e < 0.17, with semi-major axis in the range 8--9 AU\ncorresponding to orbital periods of 17--21 yrs. Our solutions favor a highly\ninclined solution with a peak around i=88.5+-1.7 deg, and a longitude of\nascending node tightly constrained at Omega = -147.5+-1.5 deg. These results\nindicate that the orbital plane of the planet is likely to be above the\nmidplane of the main disk, and compatible with the warp component of the disk\nbeing tilted between 3.5 deg and 4.0 deg. This suggests that the planet plays a\nkey role in the origin of the inner warped-disk morphology of the Bpic disk.\nFinally, these orbital parameters are consistent with the hypothesis that the\nplanet is responsible for the transit-like event observed in November 1981, and\nalso linked to the cometary activity observed in the Bpic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 08:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Since neutron data is seldom available,\nwhile proton scattering data is more abundant, it is useful to have estimates\nof the difference of the neutron and proton optical potentials. This\ninformation is contained in the isospin dependence of the nucleon OP. Here we\nattempt to provide it for the nucleon-208Pb system. The goal of this paper is\nto obtain accurate n+208Pb scattering data, and use it, together with existing\np+208Pb and 208Pb(p,n)208$Bi*_{IAS} data, to obtain an accurate estimate of the\nisospin dependence of the nucleon OP at energies in the 30-60 MeV range. Cross\nsections for n+208Pb scattering were measured at 30.4 and 40.0 MeV, with a\ntypical relative (normalization) accuracy of 2-4% (3%). An angular range of 15\nto 130 degrees was covered using the beam-swinger time of flight system at\nMichigan State University. These data were analyzed by a consistent optical\nmodel study of the neutron data and of elastic p+208Pb scattering at 45 MeV and\n54 MeV. These results were combined with a coupled-channel analysis of the\n208Pb(p,n) reaction at 45 MeV, exciting the 0^+ isobaric analog state in 208Bi.\nThe new data and analysis give an accurate estimate the isospin impurity of the\nnucleon-208Pb OP at 30.4 MeV, caused by the Coulomb correction to the proton\nOP. The corrections to the real proton OP given by the CH89 global systematics\nwas found to be only few percent, while for the imaginary potential it was over\n20% at the nuclear surface. Based on the analysis of the measured elastic\np+208Pb data at 40 MeV, a Coulomb correction of similar strength and shape was\nalso predicted for the p+208Pb OP at energy around 54 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 08:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The\nequations of motion for the HFB density matrices are unique and the theory\nrespects the usual conservation laws defined by commutators of the conserved\nquantity with the Hamiltonian. In contrast, the theories based on the BCS\napproximation are more problematic. In the usual formulation of TDHF+BCS, the\nequation of continuity is violated and one sees unphysical oscillations in\nparticle densities. This can be ameliorated by freezing the occupation numbers\nduring the evolution in TDHF+BCS, but there are other problems with the BCS\nthat make it doubtful for reaction dynamics. We also compare different\nnumerical implementations of the time-dependent HFB equations. The equations of\nmotion for the $U$ and $V$ Bogoliubov transformations are not unique, but it\nappears that the usual formulation is also the most efficient. Finally, we\ncompare the time-dependent HFB solutions with numerically exact solutions of\nthe two-particle Schrodinger equation. Depending on the treatment of the\ninitial state, the HFB dynamics produces a particle emission rate at short\ntimes similar to that of the Schrodinger equation. At long times, the total\nparticle emission can be quite different, due to inherent mean-field\napproximation of the HFB theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 10:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The duplexes were constrained to reproduce\nthe NMR inter-proton distances for the A-tracts at two temperatures: 5 and 35C.\nAnalysis of the water shell structures revealed a strong correlation between\nthe groove widths on the one hand, and the types of hydration patterns and\ntheir probabilities on the other hand. Depending on the minor groove width, the\nfollowing patterns were observed in this groove: either an interstrand\n\"hydration spine\", or interstrand two-water bridges, or a double ribbon of\nintrastrand sugar-base \"water strings\". Hydration shell in the major groove is\nless regular than in the minor groove, which agrees with crystallographic data.\nAs in previous studies, energetically advantageous hydration is found for the\nA-tract conformations with narrow minor groove and wide major groove (B'-like\nDNA), known to be correlated with DNA bending and curvature. In addition, our\ncalculations indicate that the advantage of such DNA conformations is coupled\nwith the increase in adenine N7 hydration in the major groove. As the major\ngroove is opened wider, its hydration shell is enriched by energetically\nfavorable \"trident waters\" hydrogen bonded to three hydrophilic centers\nbelonging to two adjacent adenines: two N7 atoms and one amino-proton H(N6).\nBased on these results, we suggest that formation of the novel hydration\npattern in the major groove is one of the factors responsible for stabilization\nof the B'-like conformations of A-tracts at low temperature in the absense of\ndehydrating agents, leading in turn to the strong intrinsic curvature of DNA\ncontaining alternating A-tracts and \"mixed\" GC-rich sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 12:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

In the resulting \"toy\" model we can take the continuum limit\nanalytically and obtain a scale dependent spectral dimension varying from four\nto two with scale and having functional behaviour exactly of the form which was\nconjectured on the basis of the numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 12:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2012 19:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 19:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-02"}

The new parameter q appearing there is\ndirectly connected to the variance of the particular variable X, q =\n1+Var(X)/<X>^2 (with q = 1 for the usual statistical model).

The rate of supernovae can also reveal the star formation\nhistories. Supernova rates are usually measured through the non-thermal radio\ncontinuum luminosity; however, a correlation between near-infrared [FeII]\nemission and supernova remnants has also been noted. We aim to find a\nquantitative relationship between the [FeII] at 1.26 um ([FeII]$_{1.26}$)\nluminosity and supernova rate in a sample of 11 near-by starburst galaxy\ncenters. We perform a pixel-pixel analysis of this correlation on SINFONI data\ncubes. Using Br$\\gamma$ equivalent width and luminosity as the only\nobservational inputs into the Starburst 99 model, we derive the supernova rate\nat each pixel and thus create maps of supernova rates. We then compare these\nmorphologically and quantitatively to the [FeII]$_{1.26}$ luminosity. We have\nfound that a strong linear and morphological correlation exists between\nsupernova rate and [FeII]$_{1.26}$ on a pixel-pixel basis:\n  \\[ log\\frac{\\nu_{SNrate}}{yr^{-1}pc^{-2}} = 1.01 \\pm 0.2\\ast\nlog\\frac{[FeII]_{1.26}}{erg s^{-1}pc^{-2}} - 41.17 \\pm 0.9\\]\n  This relation is valid for normal star forming galaxies but breaks down for\nextreme ultra luminous galaxies. The supernova rates derived from the Starburst\n99 model are in good agreement with the radio-derived supernova rates, which\nunderlines the strength of using [FeII] emission as a tracer of supernova rate.\nWith the strong correlation found in this sample of galaxies, we conclude that\n[FeII]$_{1.26}$ emission can be generally used to derive accurate supernova\nrates on either a pixel-pixel or integrated galactic basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 12:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

More recently, we are witnessing a\nrevival of interest in possible demonstrations of the Born rule, like Zurek's\nand Deutsch's based on the decoherence and on the theory of decisions,\nrespectively. Despite an ongoing debate about the presence of hidden\nassumptions and circular reasonings, these have the merit of prompting more\nphysically oriented approaches to the problem. Here we suggest a new proof of\nthe Born rule based on the noncontextuality of probability. Within the theorem\nwe also demonstrate the continuity of probability with respect to the\namplitudes, which has been suggested to be a gap in Zurek's and Deutsch's\napproaches, and we show that NP is implicitly postulated also in their\ndemonstrations.

One would expect\nthat the relevant semi-classical expansion should be related to the tubular\nexpansion of the theory around the submanifold and an effective dynamics on the\nsubmanifold is obtainable using Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

The properties of variable stars can give independent constraints on\nthe star formation history of the host galaxy, by determining the age and\nmetallicity of the parent population. Aims. We investigate the pulsation\nproperties of 84 Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) detected by the OGLE-III survey in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), in order to understand the formation\nmechanism and the characteristics of the parent population they came from.\nMethods. We used an updated theoretical pulsation scenario to derive the mass\nand the pulsation mode of each AC in the sample. We also used a\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test to analyze the spatial distribution of the ACs, in\ncomparison with that of other groups of variable stars, and connect their\nproperties with the star formation history of the LMC. Results. We find that\nthe mean mass of ACs is 1.2 \\pm 0.2Mo. We show that ACs do not follow the same\nspatial distribution of classical Cepheids. This and the difference in their\nperiod-luminosity relations further support the hypothesis that ACs are not the\nextension to low luminosity of classical Cepheids. The spatial distribution of\nACs is also different from that of bona-fide tracers of the old population,\nsuch as RR Lyrae stars and population II Cepheids. We therefore suggest that\nthe majority of ACs in the LMC are made of intermediate-age (1-6Gyr),\nmetal-poor single stars. Finally, we investigate the relation between the\nfrequency of ACs and the luminosity of the host galaxy, disclosing that purely\nold systems follow a very tight relation and that galaxies with strong\nintermediate-age and young star formation tend to have an excess of ACs, in\nagreement with their hosting ACs formed via both single and binary star\nchannels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 14:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2012 15:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

For a single-agent system\nfacing a plan failure in a dynamic environment, arguably, attempts to repair\nthe failed plan in general do not straightforwardly bring any benefit in terms\nof time complexity. However, in multi-agent settings the communication\ncomplexity might be of a much higher importance, possibly a high communication\noverhead might be even prohibitive in certain domains. We hypothesize that in\ndecentralized systems, where coordination is enforced to achieve joint\nobjectives, attempts to repair failed multi-agent plans should lead to lower\ncommunication overhead than replanning from scratch.\n  The contribution of the presented paper is threefold. Firstly, we formally\nintroduce the multi-agent plan repair problem and formally present the core\nhypothesis underlying our work.

This property is often\ncalled the polynomial reproduction property of the subdivision scheme. It is a\nwell-known fact that this property is, in general, only necessary for the\nassociated refinable function to have approximation order $k+1$.\n  In this paper we study a different polynomial reproduction property of\nmultivariate scalar subdivision scheme with dilation matrix $mI$, $|m| \\ge 2$.\nNamely, we are interested in capability of a subdivision scheme to reproduce in\nthe limit exactly the same polynomials from which the data is sampled. The\nmotivation for this paper are the results by Adi Levin that state that such a\nreproduction property of degree $k$ of the subdivision scheme is sufficient for\nhaving approximation order $k+1$.\n  Our main result yields simple algebraic conditions on the subdivision symbol\nfor computing the exact degree of such polynomial reproduction and also for\ndetermining the associated parametrization. The parametrization determines the\ngrid points to which the newly computed values are attached at each subdivision\niteration to ensure the higher degree of polynomial reproduction.
