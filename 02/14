Specifically, we\nconsider a three-level or four-level system for the atom. Photon-photon bound\nstates emerge as a manifestation of the strong photon-photon correlation\nmediated by the atom. Effective repulsive or attractive interaction between\nphotons can be produced, causing either suppressed multiphoton transmission\n(photon blockade) or enhanced multiphoton transmission (photon-induced\ntunneling). As a result, nonclassical light sources can be generated on demand\nby sending coherent states into the proposed system. We calculate the\nsecond-order correlation function of the transmitted field and observe bunching\nand antibunching caused by the bound states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed system can produce photon pairs with a high degree of spectral\nentanglement, which have a large capacity for carrying information and are\nimportant for large-alphabet quantum communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 16:04:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 13:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 11:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

This action satisfies an \"almost inner\" property which ensures\naffiliation of the generators of the derivations {\\delta} with A, and is\nexpressed in terms of corresponding pseudo-resolvents. In particular, for an\nabelian Lie algebra X acting on a primitive C*-algebra A, it is shown that\nthere is a central extension of X which determines algebraic relations of the\nunderlying pseudo- resolvents. If the Lie action {\\delta} is ergodic, i.e. the\nonly elements of A on which all the derivations in {\\delta}_x vanish are\nmultiples of the identity, then this extension is given by a (non-degenerate)\nsymplectic form {\\sigma} on X. Moreover, the algebra generated by the\npseudo-resolvents coincides with the resolvent algebra based on the symplectic\nspace (X, {\\sigma}). Thus the resolvent algebra of the canonical commutation\nrelations, which was recently introduced in physically motivated analyses of\nquantum systems, appears also naturally in the representation theory of Lie\nalgebras of derivations acting on C*-algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 16:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We study a subset of the planetary population characterized both by\nHARPS and Kepler surveys. We compare the statistical properties of planets in\nsystems with m.sin i >5-10 M_Earth and R>2 R_Earth. If we assume that the\nunderlying population has the same characteristics, the different detection\nsensitivity to the orbital inclination relative to the line of sight allows us\nto probe the planets' mutual inclination.\n  Methods. We considered the frequency of systems with one, two and three\nplanets as dictated by HARPS data. We used Kepler's planetary period and host\nmass and radii distributions (corrected from detection bias) to model planetary\nsystems in a simple yet physically plausible way. We then varied the mutual\ninclination between planets in a system according to different prescriptions\n(completely aligned, Rayleigh distributions and isotropic) and compared the\ntransit frequencies with one, two or three planets with those measured by\nKepler.\n  Results. The results show that the two datasets are compatible, a remarkable\nresult especially because there are no tunable knobs other than the assumed\ninclination distribution.

In this paper, we\nanalyze the outage probability of the multi-relay delay-limited HARQ system\nwith opportunistic relaying scheme in decode-and-forward mode, in which the\n\\emph{best} relay is selected to transmit the source's regenerated signal. A\nsimple and distributed relay selection strategy is proposed for multi-relay\nHARQ channels. Then, we utilize the non-orthogonal cooperative transmission\nbetween the source and selected relay for retransmitting of the source data\ntoward the destination if needed, using space-time codes or beamforming\ntechniques. We analyze the performance of the system. We first derive the\ncumulative density function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the\nselected relay HARQ channels. Then, the CDF and PDF are used to determine the\noutage probability in the $l$-th round of HARQ. The outage probability is\nrequired to compute the throughput-delay performance of this half-duplex\nopportunistic relaying protocol. The packet delay constraint is represented by\n$L$, the maximum number of HARQ rounds. An outage is declared if the packet is\nunsuccessful after $L$ HARQ rounds. Furthermore, closed-form upper-bounds on\noutage probability are derived and subsequently are used to investigate the\ndiversity order of the system. Based on the derived upper-bound expressions, it\nis shown that the proposed schemes achieve the full spatial diversity order of\n$N+1$, where $N$ is the number of potential relays.

We call this problem the\ngeometric pricing problem.\n  In this paper, we study a new class of problems arising from a geometric\naspect of the pricing problem. It intuitively captures typical real-world\nassumptions that have been widely studied in marketing research, healthcare\neconomics, etc. It also helps classify other well-known pricing problems, such\nas the highway pricing problem and the graph vertex pricing problem on planar\nand bipartite graphs. Moreover, this problem turns out to have close\nconnections to other natural geometric problems such as the geometric versions\nof the unique coverage and maximum feasible subsystem problems.\n  We show that the low dimensionality arising in this pricing problem does lead\nto improved approximation ratios, by presenting sublinear-approximation\nalgorithms for two central versions of the problem: unit-demand uniform-budget\nmin-buying and single-minded pricing problems. Our algorithm is obtained by\ncombining algorithmic pricing and geometric techniques. These results suggest\nthat considering geometric aspect might be a promising research direction in\nobtaining improved approximation algorithms for such pricing problems. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is one of very few problems in the intersection\nbetween geometry and algorithmic pricing areas. Thus its study may lead to new\nalgorithmic techniques that could benefit both areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 20:36:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 09:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-25"}

Extremely bright\nmid-IR H2 rotational line emission from warm molecular gas has been detected by\nSpitzer in the kpc-scale shock created by a galaxy collision. We detect in the\nIGM CO(1-0), (2-1) and (3-2) line emission with complex profiles, spanning a\nvelocity range of 1000 km/s. The spectra exhibit the pre-shock recession\nvelocities of the two colliding gas systems (5700 and 6700 km/s), but also\nintermediate velocities. This shows that much of the molecular gas has formed\nout of diffuse gas accelerated by the galaxy-tidal arm collision. A total H2\nmass of 5x10^9 Msun is detected in the shock. The molecular gas carries a large\nfraction of the gas kinetic energy involved in the collision, meaning that this\nenergy has not been thermalized yet. The turbulent kinetic energy of the H2 gas\nis at least a factor of 5 greater than the thermal energy of the hot plasma\nheated by the collision. The ratio between the warm H2 mass derived from\nSpitzer IRS spectroscopy and the H2 mass derived from CO fluxes is ~0.3 in the\nIGM of SQ, which is 10-100 times higher than in star-forming galaxies. In the\nshocked region, the ratio of the PAH-to-CO surface luminosities, commonly used\nto measure the star formation efficiency of the H2 gas, is lower (up to a\nfactor 75) than the observed values in star-forming galaxies.

Models including\naccretion of gas-phase species onto dust grains and cosmic-ray-induced\ndesorption of atoms are able to reproduce the observed anion-to-neutral ratios,\nas well as the absolute abundances of anionic and neutral carbon chains, with a\nreasonable degree of accuracy. Due to their destructive effects, the depletion\nof oxygen atoms onto dust results in substantially greater polyyne and anion\nabundances in high-density gas (with n_{H_2} >~ 10^5 cm^{-3}).

An important question is\nwhether the distribution of arrival directions for such UHECR nuclei can\nexhibit observable anisotropy or positional correlations with their\nastrophysical source objects despite the expected strong deflections by\nintervening magnetic fields. For this purpose, we have simulated the\npropagation of UHECR nuclei including models for both the extragalactic\nmagnetic field and the Galactic magnetic field. Assuming that only iron nuclei\nare injected steadily from sources with equal luminosity and spatially\ndistributed according to the observed large scale structure in the local\nUniverse, at the number of events published by the PAO so far, the arrival\ndistribution of UHECRs would be consistent with no auto-correlation at 95%\nconfidence if the mean number density of UHECR sources $n_s >~ 10^{-6}$\nMpc$^{-3}$, and consistent with no cross-correlation with sources within 95%\nerrors for $n_s >~ 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. On the other hand, with 1000 events\nabove $5.5 \\times 10^{19}$ eV in the whole sky, next generation experiments can\nreveal auto-correlation with more than 99% probability even for $n_s <~\n10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, and cross-correlation with sources with more than 99%\nprobability for $n_s <~ 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. In addition, we find that the\ncontribution of Centaurus A is required to reproduce the currently observed\nUHECR excess in the Centaurus region. Secondary protons generated by\nphotodisintegration of primary heavy nuclei during propagation play a crucial\nrole in all cases, and the resulting anisotropy at small angular scales should\nprovide a strong hint of the source location if the maximum energies of the\nheavy nuclei are sufficiently high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 21:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

After high-pressure experiments the amount of rhombohedral phase was\nlarger than initially, suggesting that on the Zr-rich side of the phase\nboundary the monoclinic phase is metastable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 22:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Although LAEs have been proposed as reionization probes, their use is\nhampered by the fact their Ly{\\alpha} line is damped not only by intergalactic\nHI but also internally by dust. Our method allows to overcome such degeneracy.\nFirst, we carefully calibrate a reionization simulation with QSO absorption\nline experiments. Then we identify LAEs in two simulation boxes at z=5.7 and\nz=6.6 and we build synthetic images/spectra of a prototypical LAE. At redshift\n5.7, we find that the Ly{\\alpha} transmissivity (T_LAE) ~ 0.25, almost\nindependent of the halo mass. This constancy arises from the conspiracy of two\neffects: (i) the intrinsic Ly{\\alpha} line width and (ii) the infall peculiar\nvelocity. At higher redshift, z=6.6, where the transmissivity is instead\nlargely set by the local HI abundance and LAE transmissivity consequently\nincreases with halo mass from 0.15 to 0.3. Although outflows are present, they\nare efficiently pressure-confined by infall in a small region around the LAE;\nhence they only marginally affect transmissivity. Finally, we cast LOS\noriginating from background QSOs passing through foreground LAEs at different\nimpact parameters, and compute the quasar transmissivity (T_QSO). At smaller\nimpact parameters, d < 1 cMpc, a positive correlation between T_QSO and halo\nmass is found at z = 5.7, which tends to become less pronounced (i.e. flatter)\nat larger distances. By cross-correlating T_LAE and T_QSO, we can obtain a HI\ndensity estimate unaffected by dust. At z= 5.7, the cross-correlation is\nrelatively weak,whereas at z = 6.6 we find a clear positive correlation. We\nconclude by briefly discussing the perspectives for the application of the\nmethod to existing and forthcoming data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2012 22:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Such methods use a linear decomposition of\nthe kernel on a series of basis functions. The correct choice of these basis\nfunctions is fundamental to the efficiency and effectiveness of the matching -\nthe chosen bases should represent the underlying signal using a reasonably\nsmall number of shapes, and/or have a minimum number of user-adjustable tuning\nparameters. We examine methods whose bases comprise multiple Gauss-Hermite\npolynomials, as well as a form free basis composed of delta-functions. Kernels\nderived from delta-functions are unsurprisingly shown to be more expressive;\nthey are able to take more general shapes and perform better in situations\nwhere sum-of-Gaussian methods are known to fail. However, due to its many\ndegrees of freedom (the maximum number allowed by the kernel size) this basis\ntends to overfit the problem, and yields noisy kernels having large variance.\nWe introduce a new technique to regularize these delta-function kernel\nsolutions, which bridges the gap between the generality of delta-function\nkernels, and the compactness of sum-of-Gaussian kernels. Through this\nregularization we are able to create general kernel solutions that represent\nthe intrinsic shape of the PSF-matching kernel with only one degree of freedom,\nthe strength of the regularization lambda. The role of lambda is effectively to\nexchange variance in the resulting difference image with variance in the kernel\nitself. We examine considerations in choosing the value of lambda, including\nstatistical risk estimators and the ability of the solution to predict\nsolutions for adjacent areas. Both of these suggest moderate strengths of\nlambda between 0.1 and 1.0, although this optimization is likely dataset\ndependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 00:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Analysis of the\norbital weight distributions on the bands obtained in the first-principles\ncalculation reveals that the bands crossing the Fermi energy originate from the\nthree Pb-p orbitals and three Ca-dx2y2 orbitals. Taking these Pb-p and Ca-dx2y2\norbitals as basis wave functions, a tight-binding model is constructed. With\nthe appropriate choice of the hopping integrals and the strength of the\nspin-orbit coupling, the constructed model sucessfully captures important\nfeatures of the band structure around the Fermi energy obtained in the\nfirst-principles calculation. By applying the suitable basis transformation and\nexpanding the matrix elements in the series of the momentum measured from a\nDirac point, the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of this model is explicitely\nderived and proved to be a Dirac Hamiltonain.

Dephasing is due to hyperfine interaction with the spins\nof the ${}^{13}$C nuclei. Due to the valley and spin degrees of freedom four\nbounded states exist for any given longitudinal mode in the quantum dot. At\nzero magnetic field the spin-orbit coupling and the valley mixing split those\nfour states into two Kramers doublets. The valley mixing term for a given dot\nis determined by the intra-dot disorder and therefore the states in the Kramers\ndoublets belonging to different dots are different. We show how nonzero\nsingle-particle interdot tunneling amplitudes between states belonging to\ndifferent doublets give rise to new avoided crossings, as a function of\ndetuning, in the relevant two particle spectrum, crossing over from the two\nelectrons in one dot states configuration, $(0,2)$, to the one electron in each\ndot configuration, $(1,1)$.

We find that a well-defined return\nprobability experiment is realized when, at each single-shot cycle, the (0,2)\nground state is prepared. In this case, valley mixing increases the saturation\nvalue of the measured return probability, whereas the probability to return to\nthe (0,2) ground state remains unchanged.

JNCC is\nincreasingly proposed as an alternative to a standard layered construction,\nsuch as the OSI-model. The main performance metrics for JNCCs are scalability\nto larger networks and error rate. The diversity order is one of the most\nimportant parameters determining the error rate. The literature on JNCC is\ngrowing, but a rigorous diversity analysis is lacking, mainly because of the\nmany degrees of freedom in wireless networks, which makes it very hard to prove\ngeneral statements on the diversity order. In this paper, we consider a network\nwith slowly varying fading point-to-point links, where all sources also act as\nrelay and additional non-source relays may be present. We propose a general\nstructure for JNCCs to be applied in such network. In the relay phase, each\nrelay transmits a linear transform of a set of source codewords. Our main\ncontributions are the proposition of an upper and lower bound on the diversity\norder, a scalable code design and a new lower bound on the word error rate to\nasses the performance of the network code. The lower bound on the diversity\norder is only valid for JNCCs where the relays transform only two source\ncodewords. We then validate this analysis with an example which compares the\nJNCC performance to that of a standard layered construction. Our numerical\nresults suggest that as networks grow, it is difficult to perform significantly\nbetter than a standard layered construction, both on a fundamental level,\nexpressed by the outage probability, as on a practical level, expressed by the\nword error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 06:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-15"}

Here we summarize recent results for the Nernst effect of the\niron pnictide superconductor $\\rm LaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$, whose ground state evolves\nupon doping from an itinerant SDW to a superconducting state, and the cuprate\nsuperconductor $\\rm La_{1.8-x}Eu_{0.2}Sr_xCuO_4$ which exhibits static stripe\norder as a ground state competing with the superconductivity. In $\\rm\nLaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$, the SDW order leads to a huge Nernst response, which allows\nto detect even fluctuating SDW precursors at superconducting doping levels\nwhere long range SDW order is suppressed. This is in contrast to the impact of\nstripe order on the normal state Nernst effect in $\\rm\nLa_{1.8-x}Eu_{0.2}Sr_xCuO_4$.

We analyze two improvements of\nthis approach. First, the effect of using two different ground states with\naverage numbers of particles A and A\\pm2 is quantified. Second, by using\nprojection techniques, the role of particle number restoration is analyzed. Our\nanalysis shows that the improved treatment plays a role close to magicity,\nleading to an enhancement of the pair-transfer probability. In mid-shell\nregions, part of the error made by approximating the initial and final ground\nstates by a single vacuum is compensated by projecting onto good particle\nnumber.

Finally, a simple expression of the\npair-transfer probability is given in terms of occupation probabilities in the\ncanonical basis. We show that, in the canonical basis formulation, surface\neffects which are visible in the transfer probability are related to the\nfragmentation of single-particle occupancies close to the Fermi energy. This\nprovides a complementary interpretation with respect to the standard\nquasiparticle representation where surface effects are generated by the\nintegrated radial profiles of the contributing wave functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 09:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Although viable, this model does not\ninclude the effect of a giant planet that might have existed or been growing in\nthe outer regions. We present the results of a concept study where we have\nexamined the effect of a planetary body in the orbit of Jupiter on the early\nscattering of planetesimals from terrestrial region into the asteroid belt. We\nintegrated the orbits of a large battery of planetesimals in a disk of\nplanetary embryos, and studied their evolutions for different values of the\nmass of the planet. Results indicate that when the mass of the planet is\nsmaller than 10 Earth-masses, its effects on the interactions among\nplanetesimals and planetary embryos is negligible. However, when the planet\nmass is between 10 and 50 Earth-masses, simulations point to a transitional\nregime with ~50 Earth-mass being the value for which the perturbing effect of\nthe planet can no longer be ignored. Simulations also show that further\nincrease of the mass of the planet strongly reduces the efficiency of the\nscattering of planetesimals from the terrestrial planet region into the\nasteroid belt. We present the results of our simulations and discuss their\npossible implications for the time of giant planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 09:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The cleaning is usually performed in the time domain by using a\nquadratic function to fit the time series data, and then removing the fitted\npart from the data. Having Fourier transformed the residuals, and then\nconvolved with LISA transfer function, LISA sensitivity curve can be obtained.\nHowever, cosmic gravitational-wave background cannot be retrieved with this\napproach due to its random nature. Here we provide a new representation of\npower spectrum given by discrete Fourier transform, which is applied to find\nthe function of the drift power for the cleaning in the frequency domain.

It is shown that\nall finitely generated commutative semigroups are strongly Markov, but that\nfinitely generated subsemigroups of virtually abelian or polycyclic groups need\nnot be. Potential connections with word-hyperbolic semigroups are investigated.\nA study is made of the interaction of the classes of Markov and strongly Markov\nsemigroups with direct products, free products, and finite-index subsemigroups\nand extensions. Several questions are posed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 12:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Elucidating network properties that distinguish disease from the\nhealthy cellular state is therefore of critical importance for gaining\nsystems-level insights into disease mechanisms and ultimately for developing\nimproved therapies. By integrating gene expression data with a protein\ninteraction network to induce a stochastic dynamics on the network, we here\ndemonstrate that cancer cells are characterised by an increase in the dynamic\nnetwork entropy, compared to cells of normal physiology. Using a fundamental\nrelation between the macroscopic resilience of a dynamical system and the\nuncertainty (entropy) in the underlying microscopic processes, we argue that\ncancer cells will be more robust to random gene perturbations. In addition, we\nformally demonstrate that gene expression differences between normal and cancer\ntissue are anticorrelated with local dynamic entropy changes, thus providing a\nsystemic link between gene expression changes at the nodes and their local\nnetwork dynamics. In particular, we also find that genes which drive\ncell-proliferation in cancer cells and which often encode oncogenes are\nassociated with reductions in the dynamic network entropy. In summary, our\nresults support the view that the observed increased robustness of cancer cells\nto perturbation and therapy may be due to an increase in the dynamic network\nentropy that allows cells to adapt to the new cellular stresses. Conversely,\ngenes that exhibit local flux entropy decreases in cancer may render cancer\ncells more susceptible to targeted intervention and may therefore represent\npromising drug targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 12:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2012 19:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-22"}

Assuming\nconformal invariance to be restored after inflation, their energy density\ndecreases as radiation during the decelerating eras of the universe, and in\nparticular during reheating. Without making any assumptions on inflation, on\nthe magnetogenesis mechanism and on how the reheating proceeded, we show that\nrequiring large scale magnetic fields to remain subdominant after inflation\ngives non-trivial constraints on both the reheating equation of state parameter\nand the reheating energy scale. In terms of the so-called reheating parameter,\nwe find that ln(Rrad) > -10.1 for large scale magnetic fields of the order 5 x\n10^(-15) Gauss today.

Avoiding magnetic field backreaction is always complementary to CMB and\ncan give more stringent limits on reheating for all high energy models of\ninflation.

In particular, we aim to\ninvestigate the kinematics and dynamical state of the cloud and clumps within\nit, and the amount of CO depletion. All the submillimetre peak positions in the\ncloud identified from our previous LABOCA 870-micron map were observed in\nC17O(2-1) with APEX. Selected positions were also observed in the 13CO(2-1),\nSiO(5-4), and CH3OH(5_k-4_k) transitions at ~1 mm wavelength. The C17O lines\nwere detected towards all target positions at similar radial velocities,\nindicating that G304.74 is a coherent filamentary structure. CO does not appear\nto be significantly depleted in the clumps. Two- to three methanol 5_k-4_k\nlines near ~241.8 GHz were detected towards all selected target positions,\nwhereas SiO(5-4) was seen in only one of these positions. The 13CO(2-1) lines\nshow blue asymmetric profiles, indicating large-scale infall motions. The\nclumps show trans- to supersonic non-thermal motions, and virial-parameter\nanalysis suggests that most of them are gravitationally bound. The external\npressure may also play a non-negligible role in the dynamics. This is\nqualitatively consistent with our earlier suggestion that the filament was\nformed by converging supersonic turbulent flows. The analysis suggests that the\nfragmentation of the filament into clumps is caused by \"sausage\"-type\ninstability, in agreement with results from other IRDCs. The star-formation\nactivity in the cloud, such as outflows, is likely responsible in releasing CO\nfrom the icy grain mantles back into the gas phase. Shocks related to outflows\nmay have also injected CH3OH, SiO, and DCN into the gas-phase in SMM 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 14:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

One of the problems\nwith the commonly used Pearson's correlation coefficient (termed as the\nassortativity coefficient) is that {in disassortative networks its magnitude\ndecreases} with the network size. This makes it impossible to compare mixing\npatterns, for example, in two web crawls of different size.\n  We start with a simple model of two heavy-tailed highly correlated random\nvariable $X$ and $Y$, and show that the sample correlation coefficient\nconverges in distribution either to a proper random variable on $[-1,1]$, or to\nzero, and if $X,Y\\ge 0$ then the limit is non-negative. We next show that it is\nnon-negative in the large graph limit when the degree distribution has an\ninfinite third moment. We consider the alternative degree-degree dependency\nmeasure, based on the Spearman's rho, and prove that it converges to an\nappropriate limit under very general conditions.

Similarly, the frequency of optically thick regions correlates\nwith H I column density, with optically thin objects dominating at the lowest\nN(HI).
