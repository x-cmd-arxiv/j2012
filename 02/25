These sources represent the youngest (16Myr and 12Myr\nold respectively) debris disc hosts with emission on <<10AU scales. We find\nthat the disc of HD113766 is partially resolved on baselines of 42-102m, with\nvariations in resolution with baseline length consistent with a Gaussian model\nfor the disc with FWHM of 1.2-1.6AU (9-12mas). This is consistent with the\nVISIR observations which place an upper limit of 0.\"14 (17AU) on the emission,\nwith no evidence for extended emission at larger distances. For HD172555 the\nMIDI observations are consistent with complete resolution of the disc emission\non all baselines of lengths 56-93m, putting the dust at a distance of >1AU\n(>35mas). When combined with limits from TReCS imaging the dust at ~10um is\nconstrained to lie somewhere in the region 1-8AU. Observations at ~18um reveal\nextended disc emission which could originate from the outer edge of a broad\ndisc, the inner parts of which are also detected but not resolved at 10um, or\nfrom a spatially distinct component. These observations provide the most\naccurate direct measurements of the location of dust at 1-8AU that might\noriginate from the collisions expected during terrestrial planet formation.\nThese observations provide valuable constraints for models of the composition\nof discs at this epoch and provide a foundation for future studies to examine\nin more detail the morphology of debris discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 16:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this paper, we study locality\nin \"theory space\", four-dimensional Lagrangians which are dimensional\ndeconstructions of five-dimensional Yang-Mills. In explicit ultraviolet (UV)\ncompletions, one can understand the origin of theory space locality by the\nirrelevance of nonlocal operators. From an infrared (IR) point of view, though,\ntheory space locality does not appear to be a special property, since the\nlowest-lying Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes are simply described by a gauged nonlinear\nsigma model, and locality imposes seemingly arbitrary constraints on the KK\nspectrum and interactions. We argue that these constraints are nevertheless\nimportant from an IR perspective, since they affect the four-dimensional cutoff\nof the theory where high energy scattering hits strong coupling. Intriguingly,\nwe find that maximizing this cutoff scale implies five-dimensional locality. In\nthis way, theory space locality is correlated with weak coupling in the IR,\nindependent of UV considerations. We briefly comment on other scenarios where\nmaximizing the cutoff scale yields interesting physics, including theory space\ndescriptions of QCD and deconstructions of anti-de Sitter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 16:24:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 17:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 18:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-10"}

Here we report on profiles of emission\nlines that arise from such bow shock morphologies. To compute emission line\nprofiles, we adopt a two component flow structure of wind and clumps using two\n\"beta\" velocity laws. While individual bow shocks tend to generate double\nhorned emission line profiles, a group of bow shocks can lead to line profiles\nwith a range of shapes with blueshifted peak emission that depends on the\ndegree of X-ray photoabsorption by the interclump wind medium, the number of\nclump structures in the flow, and the radial distribution of the clumps. Using\nthe two beta law prescription, the theoretical emission measure and temperature\ndistribution throughout the wind can be derived. The emission measure tends to\nbe power law, and the temperature distribution broad in terms of wind velocity.\nAlthough restricted to the case of adiabatic cooling, our models highlight the\ninfluence of bow shock effects for hot plasma temperature and emission measure\ndistributions in stellar winds and their impact on X-ray line profile shapes.\nPrevious models have focused on geometrical considerations of the clumps and\ntheir distribution in the wind.

The disk is proposed to\nhave formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its\nenvelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal\ndebris forming a disk. A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed\ncloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the\nexpected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters\nmay be as high as $\\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. The star should also be spun up by\nthe encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular\nmomentum from the star. Once the disk expands up to the tidal truncation\nradius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may\nplace gas streams on larger orbits which can give rise to a photoevaporation\nwind that forms the cloud at every orbit. This model predicts that, after the\ncloud is disrupted at the next peribothron passage in 2013, a smaller\nunresolved cloud will gradually grow around the star on the same present orbit.\nAn increased infrared luminosity from the disk may also be detectable when the\nperibothron is reached.

At low temperatures nonmagnetic impurities suppress\na weak maximum in $H_s(T)$ which has been predicted for the clean limit,\nresulting instead in a maximum of $H_s$ as a function of impurity concentration\nin a moderately clean limit. It is shown that nonmagnetic impurities weakly\naffect $H_s$ even in the dirty limit, while magnetic impurities suppress both\n$H_s$ and the critical temperature $T_c$. The density of quasiparticles states\n$N(\\epsilon)$ is strongly affected by an interplay of impurity scattering and\ncurrent pairbreaking.

As it is well known, this intriguing, fundamental\nquantum condition is at the core of a famous argument conceived by Erwin\nSchroedinger, back in 1935. The main experimental challenge to the actual\nrealization of this object resides generally on the unavoidable and\nuncontrolled interactions with the environment, i.e. the decoherence leading to\nthe cancellation of any evidence of the quantum features associated with the\nmacroscopic system. The present scheme is based on a nonlinear process, the\n\"quantum injected optical parametric amplification\", that maps by a linearized\ncloning process the quantum coherence of a single - particle state, i.e. a\nMicro - qubit, into a Macro - qubit, consisting in a large number M of photons\nin quantum superposition. Since the adopted scheme was found resilient to\ndecoherence, the MQS\\ demonstration was carried out experimentally at room\ntemperature with $M\\geq $ $10^{4}$. This result elicited an extended study on\nquantum cloning, quantum amplification and quantum decoherence. The related\ntheory is outlined in the article where several experiments are reviewed such\nas the test on the \"no-signaling theorem\" and the dynamical interaction of the\nphoton MQS with a Bose-Einstein condensate. In addition, the consideration of\nthe Micro - Macro entanglement regime is extended into the Macro - Macro\ncondition. The MQS interference patterns for large M were revealed in the\nexperiment and the bipartite Micro-Macro entanglement was also demonstrated for\na limited number of generated particles: $M\\precsim 12$. At last, the\nperspectives opened by this new method are considered in the view of further\nstudies on quantum foundations and quantum measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 18:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-05"}

This allows to express the partition function of the O(n)\nloop model as a specialization of the multivariate generating function of maps\nwith controlled face degrees, where the face weights are determined by a fixed\npoint condition. We deduce a functional equation for the resolvent of the\nmodel, involving some ring generating function describing the immediate\nvicinity of the loops. When the ring generating function has a single pole, the\nmodel is amenable to a full solution. Physically, such situation is realized\nupon considering loops visiting triangles only and further weighting these\nloops by some local bending energy. Our model interpolates between the two\npreviously solved cases of triangulations without bending energy and\nquadrangulations with rigid loops. We analyze the phase diagram of our model in\ndetails and derive in particular the location of its non-generic critical\npoints, which are in the universality classes of the dense and dilute O(n)\nmodel coupled to 2D quantum gravity.

The major challenge in femtocell networks is\ninterference management which in our system, based on the Long Term Evolution\n(LTE) standard, translates to which user should be allocated which physical\nresource block (or fraction thereof) from which femtocell access point (FAP).\nThe globally optimal solution requires integer programming and is\nmathematically intractable. We propose a hierarchical three-stage solution:\nfirst, the load of each FAP is estimated considering the number of users\nconnected to the FAP, their average channel gain and required data rates.\nSecond, based on each FAP's load, the physical resource blocks (PRBs) are\nallocated to FAPs in a manner that minimizes the interference by coloring the\nmodified interference graph. Finally, the resource allocation is performed at\neach FAP considering users' instantaneous channel gain. The two major\nadvantages of this suboptimal approach are the significantly reduced\ncomputation complexity and the fact that the proposed algorithm only uses\ninformation that is already likely to be available at the nodes executing the\nrelevant optimization step.

Such a formulation does\nnot fully capture the goal of the allocation, which is to minimize the traffic\nbetween registers and memory. Linear scan has been proposed as an alternative\nto graph coloring, but in essence, it can be viewed as a greedy algorithm for\ngraph coloring: coloring the vertices not in the order of their degrees, but in\nthe order of their occurence in the program. Thus it suffers from almost the\nsame constraints as graph coloring. In this article, I propose a new method of\nregister allocation based on the ideas of model transformer semantics (MTS) and\nstatic cache replacement (SCR). Model transformer semantics captures the\nsemantics of registers and the stack. Static cache replacement relaxes the\nassumptions made by graph coloring and linear scan, aiming directly at reducing\nregister-memory traffic. The method explores a much larger solution space than\nthat of graph coloring and linear scan, thus providing more opportunities of\noptimization.

In this\npaper, we present a conceptual framework to understand how faster-than-light\nevents involving neutrinos (as indicated by time-of-flight) might occur. We\npropose that observations of this kind do not violate the special theory of\nrelativity; instead, they only help to provide evidence in support of the\ngeneral theory of relativity at quantum scales. Given the relativistic effects\nof the neutrino on its local spacetime environment, the measured time-of-flight\nat the macroscopic level is attributable to a decrease in the effective path\nlength traversed by the neutrino. Specifically, along preferred directions, we\nshow that the Kerr metric allows for the compression of spacetime; hence, the\ndecreased path length hypothesis is plausible. Furthermore, when the motion of\nthe neutrino is along the preferred direction for spacetime compression, the\nKerr metric also predicts strong frame dragging effects near the Planck length.\nIn the region where strong frame dragging occurs, we propose that the\nmicroscopic explanation for the path length compression is due to the formation\nof 'micro-wormholes' near the Planck length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 21:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2012 19:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2012 18:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-03-15"}

In our first contribution, we establish a relation between\nthe cover times of a pair of graphs, and the cover time of their Cartesian\nproduct. This extends previous work on special cases of the Cartesian product,\nin particular, the square of a graph. We show that when one of the factors is\nin some sense larger than the other, its cover time dominates, and can become\nwithin a logarithmic factor of the cover time of the product as a whole. Our\nmain theorem effectively gives conditions for when this holds. The techniques\nand lemmas we introduce may be of independent interest. In our second\ncontribution, we determine the precise asymptotic value of the cover time of a\nrandom graph with given degree sequence. This is a graph picked uniformly at\nrandom from all simple graphs with that degree sequence. We also show that with\nhigh probability, a structural property of the graph called conductance, is\nbounded below by a constant. This is of independent interest. Finally, we\nexplore random walks with weighted random edge choices. We present a weighting\nscheme that has a smaller worst case cover time than a simple random walk.

Due to \"heavy tails\" in the hop\nprobability, this is a random walk with divergent diffusivity (process known as\nthe Levy flight). Our key evidence is derived from the ratio of transmitted and\nreflected luminescence spectra, measured in samples of different thicknesses.\nThese experiments prove the non-exponential decay of the hole concentration\nfrom the initial photo-excitation spot. The power-law decay, characteristic of\nLevy flights, is steep enough at short distances (steeper than an exponent) to\nfit the data for thin samples and slow enough at large distances to account for\nthick samples. The high radiative efficiency makes possible a semiconductor\nscintillator with efficient photon collection.

Nevertheless,\nafter repeated recycling most photons find their way to one of two photodiodes\nintegrated on both sides of the semiconductor slab.

We are interested in application scenarios\nwhere concurrent function evaluations are possible. Under such a setting, BO\ncould choose to either sequentially evaluate the function, one input at a time\nand wait for the output of the function before making the next selection, or\nevaluate the function at a batch of multiple inputs at once. These two\ndifferent settings are commonly referred to as the sequential and batch\nsettings of Bayesian Optimization. In general, the sequential setting leads to\nbetter optimization performance as each function evaluation is selected with\nmore information, whereas the batch setting has an advantage in terms of the\ntotal experimental time (the number of iterations). In this work, our goal is\nto combine the strength of both settings. Specifically, we systematically\nanalyze Bayesian optimization using Gaussian process as the posterior estimator\nand provide a hybrid algorithm that, based on the current state, dynamically\nswitches between a sequential policy and a batch policy with variable batch\nsizes. We provide theoretical justification for our algorithm and present\nexperimental results on eight benchmark BO problems.

It is well known that there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between such an entropy vector and a certain\ngroup-characterizable vector obtained from a finite group and $n$ of its\nsubgroups [3]. This correspondence may be useful for characterizing the space\nof entropic vectors and for designing network codes. If one restricts attention\nto abelian groups then not all entropy vectors can be obtained. This is an\nexplanation for the fact shown by Dougherty et al [4] that linear network codes\ncannot achieve capacity in general network coding problems. All abelian\ngroup-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors generated by\nlinear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the Ingleton\ninequality. It is therefore of interest to identify groups that violate the\nIngleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian\nfinite groups that yield characterizable vectors which violate the Ingleton\ninequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group $S_5$\nto be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study\nof the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to\nthe Ingleton-violating family $PGL(2,q)$ with a prime power $q \\geq 5$, i.e.,\nthe projective group of $2\\times 2$ nonsingular matrices with entries in\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$. We further interpret this family using the theory of group\nactions. We also extend the construction to more general groups such as\n$PGL(n,q)$ and $GL(n,q)$. The families of groups identified here are therefore\ngood candidates for constructing network codes more powerful than linear\nnetwork codes, and we discuss some considerations for constructing such group\nnetwork codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 02:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 21:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

This\nmethod is inspired by the Empirical Mode Decomposition method (EMD) and the\nrecently developed compressed (compressive) sensing theory. The main idea is to\nlook for the sparsest representation of multiscale data within the largest\npossible dictionary consisting of intrinsic mode functions of the form $\\{a(t)\n\\cos(\\theta(t))\\}$, where $a \\in V(\\theta)$, $V(\\theta)$ consists of the\nfunctions smoother than $\\cos(\\theta(t))$ and $\\theta'\\ge 0$. This problem can\nbe formulated as a nonlinear $L^0$ optimization problem. In order to solve this\noptimization problem, we propose a nonlinear matching pursuit method by\ngeneralizing the classical matching pursuit for the $L^0$ optimization problem.\nOne important advantage of this nonlinear matching pursuit method is it can be\nimplemented very efficiently and is very stable to noise. Further, we provide a\nconvergence analysis of our nonlinear matching pursuit method under certain\nscale separation assumptions. Extensive numerical examples will be given to\ndemonstrate the robustness of our method and comparison will be made with the\nEMD/EEMD method.

The 487.2GHz\nline was clearly detected toward all three observed positions in rho Oph A. In\naddition, an oversampled map of the 773.8GHz transition revealed the detection\nof the line in only half of the observed area.

Along the way it is shown that the sum of a\nSprig and its negative is equivalent to 0 in the universe of mis\\`ere-play\ndicotic games, answering a question of Allen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 15:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-28"}

A mean field study of ordered states reveals an orbitally ordered ground\nstate that isolates the spin degrees of freedom into spin chains.

Aiming for the realization of neutrino astronomy\nutilizing the Earth-skimming tau neutrino detection technique, highly precise\ndetermination of arrival direction is key due to the following issues: (1)\nClear identification of neutrinos by identifying those vertices originating\nwithin the Earth's surface; (2) Identification of very high energy neutrino\nsources. The Ashra detector uses newly developed light collectors which realize\nboth a 42 degree-diameter field-of-view and arcminute resolution. Therefore, it\nhas superior angular resolution for imaging Cherenkov air showers. In this\npaper, we estimate the sensitivity of and cosmic-ray background resulting from\napplication of the Ashra-1 Cherenkov tau shower observation method. Both data\nfrom a commissioning run and a long-term observation (with fully equipped\ntrigger system and one light collector) are presented. Our estimates are based\non a detailed Monte Carlo simulation which describes all relevant shower\nprocesses from neutrino interaction to Cherenkov photon detection produced by\ntau air showers. In addition, the potential to determine the arrival direction\nof Cherenkov showers is evaluated by using the maximum likelihood method. We\nconclude that the Ashra-1 detector is a unique probe into detection of very\nhigh energy neutrinos and their accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 15:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 11:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Such systems, with\nthe closed loop damping remaining invariant to gain changes can be used to\nproduce dead-beat step response with only rise time varying with gain. This\ntechnique is used to achieve an active step-back in a Pressurized Heavy Water\nReactor (PHWR) where it is desired to change the reactor power to a\npre-determined value within a short interval keeping the power undershoot as\nlow as possible. This paper puts forward an approach as an alternative for the\npresent day practice of a passive step-back mechanism where the control rods\nare allowed to drop during a step-back action by gravity, with release of\nelectromagnetic clutches. The reactor under a step-back condition is identified\nas a system using practical test data and a suitable Proportional plus Integral\nplus Derivative (PID) controller is designed for it. Then the combined plant is\naugmented with a phase shaper to achieve a dead-beat response in terms of power\ndrop. The fact that the identified static gain of the system depends on the\ninitial power level at which a step-back is initiated, makes this application\nparticularly suited for using a FO phase shaper. In this paper, a model of a\nnuclear reactor is developed for a control rod drop scenario involving rapid\npower reduction in a 500MWe Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactor using\nAutoRegressive Exogenous (ARX) algorithm. The system identification and reduced\norder modeling are developed from practical test data. For closed loop active\ncontrol of the identified reactor model, the fractional order phase shaper\nalong with a PID controller is shown to perform better than the present Reactor\nRegulating System (RRS) due to its iso-damped nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2012 15:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-28"}
