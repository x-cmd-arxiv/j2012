However, protection of qubit coherence during a multi-qubit gate poses\na non-trivial problem: in general the decoupling disrupts the inter-qubit\ndynamics, and hence conflicts with gate operation. This problem is particularly\nsalient for hybrid systems, wherein different types of qubits evolve and\ndecohere at vastly different rates.

Our design harnesses the internal resonance in\nthe coupled-spin system to resolve the conflict between gate operation and\ndecoupling. We experimentally demonstrate these gates on a two-qubit register\nin diamond operating at room temperature. Quantum tomography reveals that the\nqubits involved in the gate operation are protected as accurately as idle\nqubits. We further illustrate the power of our design by executing Grover's\nquantum search algorithm, achieving fidelities above 90% even though the\nexecution time exceeds the electron spin dephasing time by two orders of\nmagnitude. Our results directly enable decoherence-protected interface gates\nbetween different types of promising solid-state qubits. Ultimately, quantum\ngates with integrated decoupling may enable reaching the accuracy threshold for\nfault-tolerant quantum information processing with solid-state devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 16:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}

In particular, we examine the\nextent to which these ensembles capture topological and confinement properties\nof the Yang-Mills vacuum. This further allows us to test the classic picture of\nmeron-induced quark confinement as triggered by dimeron dissociation. At small\nbare couplings, spacial, topological-charge and color correlations among the\ndimerons generate a short-range order which screens topological charges. With\nincreasing coupling this order weakens rapidly, however, in part because the\ndimerons gradually dissociate into their meron constituents. Monitoring\nconfinement properties by evaluating Wilson-loop expectation values, we find\nthe growing disorder due to these progressively liberated merons to generate a\nfinite and (with the coupling) increasing string tension. The short-distance\nbehavior of the static quark-antiquark potential, on the other hand, is\ndominated by small, \"instanton-like\" dimerons. String tension, action density\nand topological susceptibility of the dimeron ensembles in the physical\ncoupling region turn out to be of the order of standard values. Hence the above\nresults demonstrate without reliance on weak-coupling or low-density\napproximations that the dissociating dimeron component in the Yang-Mills vacuum\ncan indeed produce a meron-populated confining phase. The density of\ncoexisting, hardly dissociated and thus instanton-like dimerons seems to remain\nlarge enough, on the other hand, to reproduce much of the additional\nphenomenology successfully accounted for by non-confining instanton vacuum\nmodels. Hence dimeron ensembles should provide an efficient basis for a rather\ncomplete description of the Yang-Mills vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 16:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

We call it the\nintermediate disorder regime. It is accessed by scaling the inverse temperature\nparameter $\\beta$ to zero as the polymer length $n$ tends to infinity. The\nnatural choice of scaling is $\\beta_n:=\\beta n^{-1/4}$. We show that the\npolymer measure under this scaling has previously unseen behavior. While the\nfluctuation exponents of the polymer endpoint and the log partition function\nare identical to those for simple random walk ($\\zeta=1/2,\\chi=0$), the\nfluctuations themselves are different. These fluctuations are still influenced\nby the random environment, and there is no self-averaging of the polymer\nmeasure. In particular, the random distribution of the polymer endpoint\nconverges in law (under a diffusive scaling of space) to a random absolutely\ncontinuous measure on the real line. The randomness of the measure is inherited\nfrom a stationary process $A_{\\beta}$ that has the recently discovered\ncrossover distributions as its one-point marginals, which for large $\\beta$\nbecome the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We also prove existence of a limiting\nlaw for the four-parameter field of polymer transition probabilities that can\nbe described by the stochastic heat equation. In particular, in this weak noise\nlimit, we obtain the convergence of the point-to-point free energy fluctuations\nto the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution.

The jet quenching is strongly enhanced for a quark moving\nalong the anisotropic direction and momentum broadening happens along the\ntransverse one. The parameter gets lower for a quark moving along the\ntransverse direction and the momentum broadening considered along the\nanisotropic one. Finally, a weaker enhancement is observed when the quark moves\nin the transverse plane and the broadening occurs on the same plane.

For\nmotion in the transverse space the drag force is enhanced compared to the\nisotropic case only for quarks having velocity above a critical value. Below\nthis critical value the force is decreased. Moreover, the drag force along the\nanisotropic direction is always stronger than the force in the transverse\nspace.

The method is motivated by and works for theories with heavy\nsquarks and Wino-like LSPs (with nearly degenerate LSP and chargino). Such\ntheories are well motivated and their gluinos typically have a O(50%) branching\nratio to charged Winos. Observing the track of a long lived charged Wino\nproduced from gluino decay could give a clear identification of a gluino event.\nCharged Wino NLSPs produced in colliders can be long-lived enough to leave a\nreconstructable high pT charged track before decaying into a soft pion (or a\nsoft lepton) and the LSP, a signature with low SM background. By supplementing\nthe canonical gluino search strategy with a search for these stiff chargino\ntracks, our results suggest it will be possible to find gluinos with\nsignificantly less luminosity. In addition, we describe a procedure for\nobtaining a kinematic measurement of the gluino mass using the three momenta of\nthe reconstructed chargino tracks. With measurements of the gluino mass and\ncross section, it will be possible to determine the gluino spin, and confirm\nthat the excess events are indeed due to a spin 1/2 superpartner. It may also\nbe possible to use these stiff Wino tracks to obtain an approximate measurement\nof the chargino mass, and therefore the LSP (dark matter) mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 20:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-23"}

We test whether such faint and extended features can be associated\nto gas-rich, major mergers, which may also lead to disc rebuilding and thus be\na corner stone for the formation of spiral galaxies. Using the TreeSPH code\nGADGET-2, we model the formation of an almost bulge-less galaxy similar to NGC\n5907 (B/T $\\le$ 0.2) after a gas-rich major merger. We indeed find that 3:1\nmajor mergers can form features similar to the loops found in many galactic\nhaloes, including in NGC 5907, and can reproduce an extended thin disc, a\nbulge, as well as the pronounced warp of the gaseous disc. Even though it\nremains difficult to fully cover the large volume of free parameters, the\npresent modelling of the loops in NGC 5907 proves that they could well be the\nresult of a major merger. It has many advantages over the satellite infall\nscenario; e.g., it solves the problem of the visibility of the satellite\nremnant, and it may explain some additional features in the NGC 5907 halo, as\nwell as some gas properties of this system. For orbital parameters derived from\ncosmological simulations, the loops in NGC 5907 can be reproduced by major\nmergers (3:1 to 5:1) and possibly by intermediate mergers (5:1 to 12:1). The\nmajor merger scenario thus challenges the minor merger one and could explain\nmany properties that haloes of spiral galaxies have in common, including their\nred colours and the presence of faint extended features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}

To investigate the spectral and spatial\nproperties of the soft X-ray emission detected by ROSAT, we have obtained\nChandra and XMM-Newton observations of A30. The X-ray emission from A30 can be\nseparated into two components: a point-source at the central star and diffuse\nemission associated with the hydrogen-poor knots and the cloverleaf structure\ninside the nebular shell. To help us assess the role of the current stellar\nwind in powering this X-ray emission, we have determined the stellar parameters\nof the central star of A 30 using a non-LTE model fit to its optical and UV\nspectrum. The spatial distribution and spectral properties of the diffuse X-ray\nemission is suggestive that it is generated by the post-born-again and present\nfast stellar winds interacting with the hydrogen-poor ejecta of the born-again\nevent. This emission can be attributed to shock-heated plasma, as the\nhydrogen-poor knots are ablated by the stellar winds, under which circumstances\nthe efficient mass-loading of the present fast stellar wind raises its density\nand damps its velocity to produce the observed diffuse soft X-rays. Charge\ntransfer reactions between the ions of the stellar winds and material of the\nborn-again ejecta has also been considered as a possible mechanism for the\nproduction of diffuse X-ray emission, and upper limits on the expected X-ray\nproduction by this mechanism have been derived. The origin of the X-ray\nemission from the central star of A 30 is puzzling: shocks in the present fast\nstellar wind and photospheric emission can be ruled out, while the development\nof a new, compact hot bubble confining the fast stellar wind seems implausible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 21:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 09:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-09"}

We detect a weak\nlarge-scale magnetic field of a few Gauss at the surface of the star. The field\nconfiguration is mainly poloidal at both observing epochs.

The heating and cooling cause it to be highly compressible, and, in\nsome regimes of density and temperature, to become thermally unstable, tending\nto spontaneously segregate into warm/diffuse and cold/dense phases. On the\nother hand, turbulence is an inherently mixing process, tending to replenish\nthe density and temperature ranges that would be forbidden under thermal\nprocesses alone. The turbulence in the ionized ISM appears to be transonic\n(i.e, with Mach numbers $\\Ms \\sim 1$), and thus to behave essentially\nincompressibly. However, in the neutral medium, thermal instability causes the\nsound speed of the gas to fluctuate by up to factors of $\\sim 30$, and thus the\nflow can be highly supersonic with respect to the dense/cold gas, although\nnumerical simulations suggest that this behavior corresponds more to the\nensemble of cold clumps than to the clumps' internal velocity dispersion.\nFinally, coherent large-scale compressions in the warm neutral medium (induced\nby, say, the passage of spiral arms or by supernova shock waves) can produce\nlarge, dense molecular clouds that are subject to their own self-gravity, and\nbegin to contract gravitationally. Because they are populated by nonlinear\ndensity fluctuations, whose local free-fall times are significantly smaller\nthan that of the whole cloud, the fluctuations terminate their collapse\nearlier, giving rise to a regime of hierarchical gravitational fragmentation,\nwith small-scale collapses occurring within larger-scale ones. Thus, the\n\"turbulence\" in molecular clouds may be dominated by a gravitationally\ncontracting component at all scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 23:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}

The verified\nproperties are formally expressed in temporal logics. Some temporal logics,\nsuch as CTL, are branching: they allow to express facts about the whole\ncomputation tree of the model, rather than on each single linear computation.\nThis branching aspect is even more critical when dealing with multi-modal\nlogics, i.e. logics expressing facts about systems with several transition\nrelations. A prominent example is CTLK, a logic that reasons about temporal and\nepistemic properties of multi-agent systems. In general, model checkers produce\nlinear counter-examples for failed properties, composed of a single computation\npath of the model. But some branching properties are only poorly and partially\nexplained by a linear counter-example.\n  This paper proposes richer counter-example structures called tree-like\nannotated counter-examples (TLACEs), for properties in Action-Restricted CTL\n(ARCTL), an extension of CTL quantifying paths restricted in terms of actions\nlabeling transitions of the model. These counter-examples have a branching\nstructure that supports more complete description of property violations.\nElements of these counter-examples are annotated with parts of the property to\ngive a better understanding of their structure. Visualization and browsing of\nthese richer counter-examples become a critical issue, as the number of\nbranches and states can grow exponentially for deeply-nested properties.\n  This paper formally defines the structure of TLACEs, characterizes adequate\ncounter-examples w.r.t. models and failed properties, and gives a generation\nalgorithm for ARCTL properties. It also illustrates the approach with examples\nin CTLK, using a reduction of CTLK to ARCTL. The proposed approach has been\nimplemented, first by extending the NuSMV model checker to generate and export\nbranching counter-examples, secondly by providing an interactive graphical\ninterface to visualize and browse them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 01:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-22"}

The kinematic, morphological,\ngeometrical, and helicity evolution of a loop-like eruptive prominence are\nstudied in the context of the magnetic flux rope model of solar prominences.\nThe prominence eruption evolved as a height expanding twisted loop with both\nlegs anchored in the chromosphere of a plage area. The eruption process\nconsists of a prominence activation, acceleration, and a phase of constant\nvelocity. The prominence body was composed of left-hand (counter-clockwise)\ntwisted threads around the main prominence axis. The twist during the eruption\nwas estimated at 6pi (3 turns). The prominence reached a maximum height of 526\nMm before contracting to its primary location and partially reformed in the\nsame place two days after the eruption. This ejection, however, triggered a CME\nseen in LASCO C2. The prominence was located in the northern periphery of the\nCME magnetic field configuration and, therefore, the background magnetic field\nwas asymmetric with respect to the filament position. The physical conditions\nof the falling plasma blobs were analysed with respect to the prominence\nkinematics. The same sign of the prominence body twist and writhe, as well as\nthe amount of twisting above the critical value of 2pi after the activation\nphase indicate that possibly conditions for kink instability were present. No\nsignature of magnetic reconnection was observed anywhere in the prominence body\nand its surroundings. The filament/prominence descent following the eruption\nand its partial reformation at the same place two days later suggest a confined\ntype of eruption. The asymmetric background magnetic field possibly played an\nimportant role in the failed eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 07:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The reduction of the degrees of freedom is done by\nidentifying the microscopic time scales of the Boltzmann equation and\nconsidering only the slowest ones.

The\nother exhibits only comparatively weak magnetic field strengths in both layers.\n(3) The Stokes V signal is indicative of a dip in the magnetic field strength\nclose to the chromospheric PIL. (3) In the chromosphere consistent upflows are\nfound along the PIL flanked by downflows. (4) The transversal magnetic field is\nnearly parallel to the PIL in the photosphere and inclined by 20 - 30 degree in\nthe chromosphere. (5) The chromospheric magnetic field around the filament is\nfound to be in normal configuration, while the photospheric field presents a\nconcave magnetic topology. The observations are consistent with the emergence\nof a flux rope with a subsequent formation of a filament.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 09:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Observables elucidating the connection\nwith the plateau transition include the so-called point-contact conductances\n(PCCs) between points on the boundary of the sample, described within the\nlanguage of the Chalker-Coddington network model.

Upon combining this\nrestriction property with the expected conformal invariance at the transition\npoint, we employ the mathematical theory of conformal restriction measures to\nrelate the disorder-averaged PCCs to correlation functions of primary operators\nin a conformal field theory (of central charge $c=0$). We show how this can be\nused to calculate these functions in a number of geometries with various\nboundary conditions. Since our results employ only the conformal restriction\nproperty, they are equally applicable to a number of other critical disordered\nelectronic systems in 2D.

Mid- and far-IR data are crucial to\ncharacterise the starburst contribution, allowing us to shed new light on its\nnature and to study the coexistence of AGN and starburst activity in the local\nUniverse. The decomposition of the mid-IR Spitzer spectrum shows that the AGN\nbolometric contribution to the mid-IR and total infrared luminosity is small\n(Lbol(AGN)/LIR~0.02), which agrees with previous estimations. We have\ncharacterised the physical nature of its strong infrared emission and\nconstrained it to a relatively compact emitting region of <2kpc. It is in this\nobscured region where most of the current star formation activity is taking\nplace as expected for LIRGs. We have used Herschel imaging data for the first\ntime to constrain the cold dust emission with unprecedented accuracy. We have\nfitted the integrated far-IR spectral energy distribution and derived the\nproperties of the dust, obtaining a dust mass of 3x10^7Msun. The far-IR is\ndominated by emission at 35K, consistent with dust heated by the on-going star\nformation activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 09:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

These scalars can acquire\nisocurvature fluctuations during inflation, and given that their VEVs determine\nthe mass spectrum and the coupling constants of the effective low-energy field\ntheory, these fluctuations give rise to couplings and masses that are modulated\nfrom one Hubble patch to another. These seem just what is required to obtain\nprimordial adiabatic fluctuations through conversion into density perturbations\nthrough the `modulation mechanism', wherein reheating takes place with\ndifferent efficiency in different regions of our Universe. Fluctuations\ngenerated in this way can generically produce non-gaussianity larger than\nobtained in single-field slow-roll inflation; potentially observable in the\nnear future. We provide here the first explicit example of the modulation\nmechanism at work in string cosmology, within the framework of LARGE Volume\nType-IIB string flux compactifications. The inflationary dynamics involves two\nlight Kaehler moduli: a fibre divisor plays the role of the inflaton whose\ndecay rate to visible sector degrees of freedom is modulated by the primordial\nfluctuations of a blow-up mode (which is made light by the use of\npoly-instanton corrections). We find the challenges of embedding the mechanism\ninto a concrete UV completion constrains the properties of the non-gaussianity\nthat is found, since for generic values of the underlying parameters, the model\npredicts a local bi-spectrum with fNL of order `a few'. However, a moderate\ntuning of the parameters gives also rise to explicit examples with fNL O(20)\npotentially observable by the Planck satellite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 10:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

These resistance forces arise due to the fluid\ndragged by the particle, where the bare mass of the particle at rest changes\nwhen in motion (\"dressed\" particle). It is demonstrated that the vector\npotential created by a charged particle in motion acts as an ideal space flow\nthat surrounds the particle. The interaction between the particle and the\nentrained space flow gives rise to the observed properties of inertia and the\nrelativistic increase of mass. Parallels are made between the inertia property\nof matter, electromagnetism and the hydrodynamic drag in potential flow.\nAccordingly, in this framework the non resistance of a particle in uniform\nmotion through an ideal fluid (D'Alembert's paradox) corresponds to Newton's\nfirst law.

For small theta the\nmodel is confining in the infra red, for theta = pi the model has a non-trivial\ninfra red fixed point and consequently for theta slightly below pi the coupling\nwalks. The first step in investigating the notoriously difficult systematic\neffects of the gauge theory in the toy model is to establish non-perturbatively\nthat the theta parameter is actually a relevant coupling. This is done by\nshowing that there exist quantities that are entirely given by the total\ntopological charge and are well defined in the continuum limit and are\nnon-zero, despite the fact that the topological susceptibility is divergent.\nMore precisely it is established that the differences of connected correlation\nfunctions of the topological charge (the cumulants) are finite and non-zero and\nconsequently there is only a single divergent parameter in Z(theta) but\notherwise it is finite. This divergent constant can be removed by an\nappropriate counter term rendering the theory completely finite even at theta >\n0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 12:13:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 09:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The dynamics of this system and its\ncoupling to electron spins is fundamentally different from its bulk\ncounter-part as well as that of atoms due to increased fluctuations that result\nfrom reduced dimensions. In recent years, the interest in studying quantum dot\nnuclear spin systems and their coupling to confined electron spins has been\nfueled by its direct implication for possible applications of such systems in\nquantum information processing as well as by the fascinating nonlinear\n(quantum-)dynamics of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system. In this\narticle, we review experimental work performed over the last decades in\nstudying this mesoscopic,coupled electron-nuclear spin system and discuss how\noptical addressing of electron spins can be exploited to manipulate and\nread-out quantum dot nuclei.

Our formalism stems from an exact\nfactorization of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction of the clock plus system\ncomposite, where the clock and system factors play the role of marginal and\nconditional probability amplitudes, respectively. Application of the Variation\nPrinciple leads to a pair of exact coupled pseudoeigenvalue equations for these\namplitudes, whose solution requires an iterative self-consistent procedure. The\nequation for the conditional amplitude constitutes an effective \"equation of\nmotion\" for the quantum state of the system with respect to the clock\nvariables. These coupled equations also provide a convenient framework for\ntreating the back-reaction of the system on the clock at various levels of\napproximation. At the lowest level, when the WKB approximation for the marginal\namplitude is appropriate, in the classical limit of the clock variables the\nTDSE for the system emerges as a matter of course from the conditional\nequation. In this connection, we provide a discussion of the characteristics\nrequired by physical systems to serve as good clocks. This development is seen\nto be advantageous over the original CPI and semiclassical approach since it\nmaintains the essence of the conventional formalism of quantum mechanics,\nadmits a transparent interpretation, avoids the use of the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation, and resolves various objections raised about them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 13:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 15:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 17:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

To investigate this\nproblem, we model the underlying channel as a Markov modulated binary erasure\nchannel, where transmitted bits are either received successfully or erased.\nErasure codes are used to encode information prior to transmission, which\nensures that a fixed fraction of the bits in the codeword can lead to\nsuccessful decoding.

For graphs with diameter 2 we provide the first\nsubexponential algorithm with complexity $2^{O(\\sqrt{n\\log n})}$, which is\nasymptotically the same as the currently best known time complexity for the\ngraph isomorphism (GI) problem. Moreover, we prove that the graph isomorphism\nproblem on 3-colorable graphs with diameter 2 is GI-complete. Furthermore we\npresent a subclass of graphs with diameter 2 that admits a polynomial algorithm\nfor 3-coloring. For graphs with diameter 3 we establish the complexity of\n3-coloring by proving that for every $\\varepsilon \\in [0,1)$, 3-coloring is\nNP-complete on triangle-free graphs of diameter 3 and radius 2 with $n$\nvertices and minimum degree $\\delta=\\Theta(n^{\\varepsilon})$.

We measure both major (stellar mass\nratio mu = M_star,2/M_star,1 >= 1/4) and minor (1/10 <= mu < 1/4) merger\nfractions of massive galaxies, and study their dependence on redshift and on\nmorphology. The merger fraction and rate of massive galaxies evolves as a\npower-law (1+z)^n, with major mergers increasing with redshift, n_MM = 1.4, and\nminor mergers showing little evolution, n_mm ~ 0. When split by their\nmorphology, the minor merger fraction for early types is higher by a factor of\nthree than that for spirals, and both are nearly constant with redshift. Our\nresults show that massive early-type galaxies have undergone 0.89 mergers (0.43\nmajor and 0.46 minor) since z ~ 1, leading to a mass growth of ~30%. We find\nthat mu >= 1/10 mergers can explain ~55% of the observed size evolution of\nthese galaxies since z ~ 1.

The remaining ~5% should come from other\nprocesses (e.g., adiabatic expansion or observational effects). This picture\nalso reproduces the mass growth and velocity dispersion evolution of these\ngalaxies. We conclude from these results that merging is the main contributor\nto the size evolution of massive ETGs at z <= 1, accounting for ~50-75% of that\nevolution in the last 8 Gyr.

However, a robust, dynamical model of the\ntorus is required in order to understand the fundamental physics of AGNs and\ninterpret their observational signatures. Here we explore self-similar, dusty\ndisk-winds, driven by both magnetocentrifugal forces and radiation pressure, as\nan explanation for the torus. Using these models, we make predictions of AGN\ninfrared (IR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 2-100 microns by\nvarying parameters such as: the viewing angle; the base column density of the\nwind; the Eddington ratio; the black hole mass; and the amount of power in the\ninput spectrum emitted in the X-ray relative to that emitted in the UV/optical.\nWe find that models with N_H,0 = 10^25 cm^-2, L/L_Edd = 0.1, and M_BH >= 10^8\nMsun are able to adequately approximate the general shape and amount of power\nexpected in the IR as observed in a composite of optically luminous Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars. The effect of varying the relative power\ncoming out in X-rays relative to the UV is a change in the emission below ~5\nmicron from the hottest dust grains; this arises from the differing\ncontributions to heating and acceleration of UV and X-ray photons. We see mass\noutflows ranging from ~1-4 Msun/yr, terminal velocities ranging from ~1900-8000\nkm/s, and kinetic luminosities ranging from ~1x10^42-8x10^43 erg/s. Further\ndevelopment of this model holds promise for using specific features of observed\nIR spectra in AGNs to infer fundamental physical parameters of the systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 15:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Common techniques for solving the flow equations for both time dependent\nand stationary problems are ray tracing or level set methods. In the context of\npredicting the vibro-acoustic response of complex engineering structures,\nreduced ray tracing methods such as Statistical Energy Analysis or variants\nthereof have found widespread applications. Starting directly from the\nstationary Liouville equation, we develop a boundary element method for solving\nthe transport equations for complex multi-component structures. The method,\nwhich is an improved version of the Dynamical Energy Analysis technique\nintroduced recently by the authors, interpolates between standard statistical\nenergy analysis and full ray tracing, containing both of these methods as\nlimiting cases. We demonstrate that the method can be used to efficiently deal\nwith complex large scale problems giving good approximations of the energy\ndistribution when compared to exact solutions of the underlying wave equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2012 11:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The generalized approach is free of the standard\nparadoxes of classical decision theory.
