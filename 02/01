Unfortunately, dark matter and dark energy\nhave not been detected and no direct or indirected observations have allowed to\nprove their existence and amount. For this reason, some authors have suggested\nthat a modification of Einstein Relativity or the change of the Newton's\ndynamics law (within a relativistic and classical framework, respectively)\ncould allow to replace these unobserved components. We will start discussing\nthe role of dark matter in the early-type galaxies, mainly in their central\nregions, investigating how its content changes as a function of the mass and\nthe size of each galaxy and few considerations about the stellar Initial mass\nfunction have been made. In the second part of the paper we have described, as\nexamples, some ways to overcome the dark matter hypothesis, by fitting to the\nobservations the modified dynamics coming out from general relativistic\nextended theories and the MOdyfied Newtonian dynamics (MOND).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 16:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 11:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

To investigate the fate of\nsuch massive galaxies identified at z~2 we analyse the evolution of their\nproperties in three cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that form\nvirialised galaxy groups of mass ~10^13 Msun hosting a central massive\nelliptical/S0 galaxy by redshift zero. We find that at redshift ~2 the\npopulation of galaxies with M_*> 2 10^10 Msun is diverse in terms of mass,\nvelocity dispersion, star formation and effective radius, containing both very\ncompact and relatively extended objects. In each simulation all the compact\nsatellite galaxies have merged into the central galaxy by redshift 0 (with the\nexception of one simulation where one of such satellite galaxy survives).\nSatellites of similar mass at z = 0 are all less compact than their high\nredshift counterparts. They form later than the galaxies in the z = 2 sample\nand enter the group potential at z < 1, when dynamical friction times are\nlonger than the Hubble time. Also, by z = 0 the central galaxies have increased\nsubstantially their characteristic radius via a combination of in situ star\nformation and mergers. Hence in a group environment descendants of compact\ngalaxies either evolve towards larger sizes or they disappear before the\npresent time as a result of the environment in which they evolve. Since the\ngroup-sized halos that we consider are representative of dense environments in\nthe LambdaCDM cosmology, we conclude that the majority of high redshift compact\nmassive galaxies do not survive until today as a result of the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 16:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

The market price---an average or at least aggregate of\ntraders' beliefs---offers a better estimate than most any individual trader's\nopinion. In this paper, we ask a stronger question: how does the market price\ncompare to the best trader's belief, not just the average trader. We measure\nthe market's worst-case log regret, a notion common in machine learning theory.\nTo arrive at a meaningful answer, we need to assume something about how traders\nbehave. We suppose that every trader optimizes according to the Kelly criteria,\na strategy that provably maximizes the compound growth of wealth over an\n(infinite) sequence of market interactions. We show several consequences.\nFirst, the market prediction is a wealth-weighted average of the individual\nparticipants' beliefs. Second, the market learns at the optimal rate, the\nmarket price reacts exactly as if updating according to Bayes' Law, and the\nmarket prediction has low worst-case log regret to the best individual\nparticipant. We simulate a sequence of markets where an underlying true\nprobability exists, showing that the market converges to the true objective\nfrequency as if updating a Beta distribution, as the theory predicts. If agents\nadopt a fractional Kelly criteria, a common practical variant, we show that\nagents behave like full-Kelly agents with beliefs weighted between their own\nand the market's, and that the market price converges to a time-discounted\nfrequency. Our analysis provides a new justification for fractional Kelly\nbetting, a strategy widely used in practice for ad-hoc reasons. Finally, we\npropose a method for an agent to learn her own optimal Kelly fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 19:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-01"}

Two common\ncomplementary approaches are Lyman-Break-Galaxy (LBG) surveys for large samples\nand Gamma-Ray-Burst (GRB) observations for sensitivity to SFR in small\ngalaxies. The z>4 GRB-inferred SFR is higher than the LBG rate, but this\ndifference is difficult to understand, as both methods rely on several modeling\nassumptions. Using a physically motivated galaxy luminosity function model,\nwith star formation in dark-matter halos with virial temperature Tvir>2e4 K\n(M_DM>2e8 M_sun), we show that GRB and LBG-derived SFRs are consistent if GRBs\nextend to faint galaxies (M_AB<-11). To test star formation below the detection\nlimit L_lim~0.05L^*_{z=3} of LBG surveys, we propose to measure the fraction\nf_det(L>L_lim,z) of GRB hosts with L>L_lim. This fraction quantifies the\nmissing star formation fraction in LBG surveys, constraining the\nmass-suppression scale for galaxy formation, with weak dependence on modeling\nassumptions. Because f_det(L>L_lim,z) corresponds to the ratio of star\nformation rates derived from LBG and GRB surveys, if these estimators are\nunbiased, measuring f_det(L>L_lim,z) also constrains the redshift evolution of\nthe GRB production rate per unit mass of star formation. Our analysis predicts\nsignificant success for GRB host detections at z~5 with f_det(L>L_lim,z)~0.4,\nbut rarer detections at z>6. By analyzing the upper limits on host-galaxy\nluminosities of six z>5 GRBs from literature data, we infer that galaxies with\nM_AB>-15 were present at z>5 at 95% confidence, demonstrating the key role\nplayed by very faint galaxies during reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2012 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2012 17:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this study, we\ninvestigated how partial asexuality may affect genetic diversity at the S-locus\nand fitness in small self-incompatible populations. A genetic model including\nan S-locus and a viability locus was developed to perform forward simulations\nof the evolution of populations of various sizes.

Indeed, over the last years the spread of epidemic diseases and its\nrelationship with the topology of the involved system have been a recurrent\ntopic in complex network theory, taking into account both network models and\nreal-world data. In this paper we explore possible correlations between the\nheterogeneous spread of an epidemic disease governed by the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, and several attributes of the\noriginating vertices, considering Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi (ER), Barab\\'asi-Albert (BA)\nand random geometric graphs (RGG), as well as a real case of study, the US Air\nTransportation Network that comprises the US 500 busiest airports along with\ninter-connections. Initially, the heterogeneity of the spreading is achieved\nconsidering the RGG networks, in which we analytically derive an expression for\nthe distribution of the spreading rates among the established contacts, by\nassuming that such rates decay exponentially with the distance that separates\nthe individuals. Such distribution is also considered for the ER and BA models,\nwhere we observe topological effects on the correlations. In the case of the\nairport network, the spreading rates are empirically defined, assumed to be\ndirectly proportional to the seat availability. Among both the theoretical and\nthe real networks considered, we observe a high correlation between the total\nepidemic prevalence and the degree, as well as the strength and the\naccessibility of the epidemic sources.

We focus on two cases: first, that ohmic\nheating commences when the planet is hot (high entropy); and second, that it\ncommences after the planet has cooled. In the former case, we use analytical\nscalings and numerical experiments to confirm that Ohmic heating is capable of\nsuspending the cooling as long as a few percent of the stellar irradiation is\nconverted into Ohmic heating, and the planet has a surface wind that extends to\npressures of ~10 bar or deeper. For these parameters, the radii at which\ncooling is stalled are consistent with (or larger than) the observed radii of\nmost planets. The only two exceptions are WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b. In contrast\nto the high entropy case, we show that Ohmic heating cannot significantly\nre-inflate planets after they have already cooled.

To\nmeasure the average X-ray properties of the ETG population, we use X-ray\nstacking analyses with a subset of 158 passive ETGs (148 of which were\nindividually undetected in X-ray). This ETG subset was constructed to span the\nredshift ranges of z = 0.1-1.2 in the ~4 Ms CDF-S and ~2 Ms CDF-N and z =\n0.1-0.6 in the ~250 ks E-CDF-S where the contribution from individually\nundetected AGNs is expected to be negligible in our stacking.

This means that the widely-used q-value (Storey, 2002) defined for\neach gene to be the minimum positive false discovery rate that would result in\nthe inclusion of the corresponding P-value in the discovery set, cannot be\ntranslated to the equivalence testing framework.

It is required for this\ntechnique that different receive antennas have the same time reference, but no\nsynchronization of initial phases of the receive antennas is needed and,\ntherefore, the estimation process is non-coherent. We model the target motion\nwithin a certain processing interval as a polynomial of general order. The\nfirst three coefficients of such a polynomial correspond to the initial\nlocation, velocity, and acceleration of the target, respectively. A new maximum\nlikelihood (ML) technique for estimating the target motion coefficients is\ndeveloped. It is shown that the considered ML problem can be interpreted as the\nclassic \"overdetermined\" nonlinear least-squares problem. The proposed ML\nestimator requires multi-dimensional search over the unknown polynomial\ncoefficients. The Cram\\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for the proposed parameter\nestimation problem is derived. The performance of the proposed estimator is\nvalidated by simulation results and is shown to achieve the CRB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 00:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Since primordial\nfluctuations in the CMB on these scales are completely erased by Silk damping,\nthese distortions may provide the only way to shed light on otherwise\nunobservable aspects of inflationary physics. A consistent treatment of the\nprimordial dissipation problem requires going to second order in perturbation\ntheory, while thermalization of these distortions necessitates consideration of\nsecond order in Compton scattering energy transfer. Here we give a full 2x2\ntreatment for the creation and evolution of spectral distortions due to the\nacoustic dissipation process, consistently including the effect of polarization\nand photon mixing in the free streaming regime. We show that 1/3 of the total\nenergy (9/4 larger than previous estimates) stored in small-scale temperature\nperturbations imprints observable spectral distortions, while the remaining 2/3\nonly raises the average CMB temperature, an effect that is unobservable.

The warm skins of the SF disk are governed\nby the radiation from the inner part of the accretion disk to form Compton\natmosphere (CAS). The CAS are undergoing four phases to form broad line\nregions. Phase I is the duration of pure accumulation supplied by the SF disk.\nDuring phase II clouds begin to form due to line cooling and sink to the SF\ndisk. Phase III is a period of preventing clouds from sinking to the SF disk\nthrough dynamic interaction between clouds and the CAS. Finally, phase IV is an\ninevitable collapse of the entire CAS through line cooling. This CAS evolution\ndrives the episodic appearance of BLRs. Geometry and dynamics of BLRs can be\nself-consistently derived from the thermal instability of the CAS during phases\nII and III by linear analysis. The metallicity gradient of SF disk gives rise\nto different properties of clouds from outer to inner part of BLRs. We find\nthat clouds have column density N_H < 10^22cm^{-2} in the metal-rich regions\nwhereas they have N_H > 10^22 cm^{-2} in the metal-poor regions. The metal-rich\nclouds compose the high ionization line (HIL) regions whereas the metal-poor\nclouds are in low ionization line (LIL) regions. Metal-rich clouds in HIL\nregions will be blown away by radiation pressure, forming the observed\noutflows. The LIL regions are episodic due to the mass cycle of clouds with the\nCAS in response to continuous injection by the SF disk, giving rise to\ndifferent types of AGNs. Based on SDSS quasar spectra, we identify a spectral\nsequence in light of emission line equivalent width from Phase I to IV. A key\nphase in the episodic appearance of the BLRs is bright type II AGNs with no or\nonly weak BLRs.

The PSF and\npixel response describe the spatial blurring of the source, the pixel scale\ndescribes the spatial sampling of a single exposure, and the observing strategy\ndetermines the set of dithered exposures with pointing offsets from which the\nsource flux is inferred. In a wide-field imaging survey, sources of interest\nare randomly distributed within the field of view and hence are centered\nrandomly within a pixel. A given hardware configuration and observing strategy\ntherefore have a distribution of photometric uncertainty for sources of fixed\nflux that fall in the field. In this article we explore the ensemble behavior\nof photometric and position accuracies for different PSFs, pixel scales, and\ndithering patterns. We find that the average uncertainty in the flux\ndetermination depends slightly on dither strategy, whereas the position\ndetermination can be strongly dependent on the dithering. For cases with pixels\nmuch larger than the PSF, the uncertainty distributions can be non-Gaussian,\nwith rms values that are particularly sensitive to the dither strategy. We also\nfind that for these configurations with large pixels, pointings dithered by a\nfractional pixel amount do not always give minimal average uncertainties; this\nis in contrast to image reconstruction for which fractional dithers are\noptimal. When fractional pixel dithering is favored, a pointing accuracy of\nbetter than $\\sim 0.15$ pixel width is required to maintain half the advantage\nover random dithers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 05:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-02"}

The MIR P-L\nrelations for Cepheids are important in the James Webb Space Telescope era for\nthe distance scale issue, as the relations have potential to derive the Hubble\nconstant within ~ 2% accuracy - a critical constraint in precision cosmology.\nConsequently, we have derived the MIR P-L relations for Cepheids in the Large\nand Small Magellanic Clouds, using archival data from Spitzer Space Telescope.\nWe also compared currently empirical P-L relations for Cepheids in the\nMagellanic Clouds to the synthetic MIR P-L relations derived from pulsational\nmodels. For the study of multi-phase P-L relations, we present convincing\nevidence that the Cepheid P-L relations in the Magellanic Clouds are highly\ndynamic quantities that vary significantly when considered as a function of\npulsational phase. We found that there is a difference in P-L relations as a\nfunction of phase between the Cepheids in each of the Clouds; the most likely\ncause for this is the metallicity difference between the two galaxies.

The polynomial interpolant is expressed in terms of\nfunction values using the so-called barycentric weights, which depend on the\ninterpolation points. Few explicit formulae for these barycentric weights are\nknown. In [H. Wang and S. Xiang, Math. Comp., 81 (2012), 861--877], the authors\nhave shown that the barycentric weights of the roots of Legendre polynomials\ncan be expressed explicitly in terms of the weights of the corresponding\nGaussian quadrature rule.

Trefethen and others, The Chebfun Development Team, 2011] and in\nthe process generalized by the Chebfun authors to the roots of Jacobi, Laguerre\nand Hermite polynomials. In this paper, we explore the generality of the link\nbetween barycentric weights and Gaussian quadrature and show that such\nrelationships are related to the existence of lowering operators for orthogonal\npolynomials. We supply an exhaustive list of cases, in which all known formulae\nare recovered and also some new formulae are derived, including the barycentric\nweights for Gauss-Radau and Gauss-Lobatto points.

The\nfact that the magnetic field is identically zero at these points suggests that\nfor the study of current sheet formation and of any subsequent resistive\ndissipation phase, a finite beta plasma should be considered, rather than\nneglecting the plasma pressure as has often been the case in the past. The\nrapid dissipation of a finite current layer in non-force-free equilibrium is\ninvestigated numerically, after the sudden onset of an anomalous resistivity.\nThe aim of this study is to determine how the energy is redistributed during\nthe initial diffusion phase, and what is the nature of the outward transmission\nof information and energy. The resistivity rapidly diffuses the current at the\nnull point. The presence of a plasma pressure allows the vast majority of the\nfree energy to be transferred into internal energy. Most of the converted\nenergy is used in direct heating of the surrounding plasma, and only about 3%\nis converted into kinetic energy, causing a perturbation in the magnetic field\nand the plasma which propagates away from the null at the local fast\nmagnetoacoustic speed. The propagating pulses show a complex structure due to\nthe highly non-uniform initial state. It is shown that this perturbation\ncarries no net current as it propagates away from the null. The fact that,\nunder the assumptions taken in this paper, most of the magnetic energy released\nin the reconnection converts internal energy of the plasma, may be highly\nimportant for the chromospheric and coronal heating problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 12:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-02"}

This is of first importance since the\nglobal minimum of such a map is reached at a critical point. Thus, these points\nappear naturally in non-convex polynomial optimization which occurs in a wide\nrange of scientific applications (control theory, chemistry, economics,...).\nCritical points also play a central role in recent algorithms of effective real\nalgebraic geometry. Experimentally, it has been observed that Gr\\\"obner basis\nalgorithms are efficient to compute such points. Therefore, recent software\nbased on the so-called Critical Point Method are built on Gr\\\"obner bases\nengines. Let $f_1,..., f_p$ be polynomials in $ \\Q[x_1,..., x_n]$ of degree\n$D$, $V\\subset\\C^n$ be their complex variety and $\\pi_1$ be the projection map\n$(x_1,.., x_n)\\mapsto x_1$. The critical points of the restriction of $\\pi_1$\nto $V$ are defined by the vanishing of $f_1,..., f_p$ and some maximal minors\nof the Jacobian matrix associated to $f_1,..., f_p$. Such a system is\nalgebraically structured: the ideal it generates is the sum of a determinantal\nideal and the ideal generated by $f_1,..., f_p$. We provide the first\ncomplexity estimates on the computation of Gr\\\"obner bases of such systems\ndefining critical points. We prove that under genericity assumptions on\n$f_1,..., f_p$, the complexity is polynomial in the generic number of critical\npoints, i.e. $D^p(D-1)^{n-p}{{n-1}\\choose{p-1}}$. More particularly, in the\nquadratic case D=2, the complexity of such a Gr\\\"obner basis computation is\npolynomial in the number of variables $n$ and exponential in $p$.

Combining algebraic geometry\ntechniques with differential topology ones, we first prove a result that\ngeneralizes those previously published on this topic. Specifically, we consider\nthe input set (complex projective space of MIMO interference channels), the\noutput set (precoder and decoder Grassmannians) and the solution set (channels,\ndecoders and precoders satisfying the IA polynomial equations), not only as\nalgebraic sets but also as smooth compact manifolds. Using this mathematical\nframework, we prove that the linear alignment problem is feasible when the\nalgebraic dimension of the solution variety is larger than or equal to the\ndimension of the input space and the linear mapping between the tangent spaces\nof both smooth manifolds given by the first projection is generically\nsurjective. If that mapping is not surjective, then the solution variety\nprojects into the input space in a singular way and the projection is a\nzero-measure set. This result naturally yields a simple feasibility test, which\namounts to checking the rank of a matrix. We also provide an exact arithmetic\nversion of the test, which proves that testing the feasibility of IA for\ngeneric MIMO channels belongs to the bounded-error probabilistic polynomial\n(BPP) complexity class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 15:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 15:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

Consequently, one of the most successful recent\napproaches to capturing the fundamental features of the structure and dynamics\nof complex systems has been the investigation of the networks associated with\nthe above units (nodes) together with their relations (edges). Most complex\nsystems have an inherently hierarchical organization and, correspondingly, the\nnetworks behind them also exhibit hierarchical features. Indeed, several papers\nhave been devoted to describing this essential aspect of networks, however,\nwithout resulting in a widely accepted, converging concept concerning the\nquantitative characterization of the level of their hierarchy. Here we develop\nan approach and propose a quantity (measure) which is simple enough to be\nwidely applicable, reveals a number of universal features of the organization\nof real-world networks and, as we demonstrate, is capable of capturing the\nessential features of the structure and the degree of hierarchy in a complex\nnetwork. The measure we introduce is based on a generalization of the m-reach\ncentrality, which we first extend to directed/partially directed graphs. Then,\nwe define the global reaching centrality (GRC), which is the difference between\nthe maximum and the average value of the generalized reach centralities over\nthe network. We investigate the behavior of the GRC considering both a\nsynthetic model with an adjustable level of hierarchy and real networks.\nResults for real networks show that our hierarchy measure is related to the\ncontrollability of the given system. We also propose a visualization procedure\nfor large complex networks that can be used to obtain an overall qualitative\npicture about the nature of their hierarchical structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 15:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 16:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-23"}
