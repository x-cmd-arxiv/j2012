By combining\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering, this can be extended to probe the\n3D galaxy-matter and galaxy-galaxy power spectrum or, alternatively, galaxy\nbiasing parameters. To achieve this aim, this paper introduces and discusses\nminimum variance estimators and a more general Bayesian approach to\nstatistically invert a set of noisy tomography 2-point correlation functions,\nmeasured within a confined opening angle. Both methods are constructed such\nthat they probe deviations of the power spectrum from a fiducial power\nspectrum, thereby enabling both a direct comparison of theory and data, and in\nprinciple the identification of the physical scale and redshift of deviations.\nBy devising a new Monte Carlo technique, we quantify the measurement noise in\nthe correlators for a fiducial survey, and test the performance of the\ninversion techniques.

If the 2 \\times 2 unitary matrix is special unitary (has\nunit determinant), the controlled-unitary gate operation can be realized in a\nsingle pulse operation. The pulse, in our scheme, will constitute varying one\nof the parameters of the system between an arbitrarily maximum and a\n\"calculated\" minimum value. This parameter will constitute the variable\nparameter of the system while the other parameters, which include the coupling\nbetween the two qubits, will be treated as fixed parameters. The values of the\nparameters are what we solve for using our approach in order to realize an\narbitrary controlled-unitary operation. We further show that the computational\ncomplexity of the operation is no greater than that required for a\nControlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. Since conventional schemes realize a\ncontrolled-unitary operation by breaking it into a sequence of single-qubit and\nCNOT gate operations, our method is an improvement because we not only require\nlesser time duration, but also fewer control lines, to implement the same\noperation. To demonstrate improvement over other schemes, we show, as examples,\nhow two controlled-unitary operations, one being the controlled-Hadamard gate,\ncan be realized in a single pulse operation using our scheme. Furthermore, our\nmethod can be applied to a wide range of coupling schemes and can be used to\nrealize gate operations between two qubits coupled via Ising, Heisenberg and\nanisotropic interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 17:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We study the structure and stability of the colliding wind region as it\nturns into a spiral due to orbital motion. We focus on adiabatic winds, where\nmixing between the two winds is expected to be restricted to the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Mixing of the Wolf-Rayet wind with\nhydrogen-rich material is important for dust formation in pinwheel nebulae such\nas WR 104, where the spiral structure has been resolved in infrared. We use the\nhydrodynamical code RAMSES with an adaptive grid. A wide range of binary\nsystems with different wind velocities and mass loss rates are studied with 2D\nsimulations. A specific 3D simulation is performed to model WR 104. Orbital\nmotion leads to the formation of two distinct spiral arms where the KHI\ndevelops differently. We find that the spiral structure is destroyed when there\nis a large velocity gradient between the winds, unless the collimated wind is\nmuch faster. We argue that the KHI plays a major role in maintaining or not the\nstructure. We discuss the consequences for various colliding wind binaries.\nWhen stable, there is no straightforward relationship between the spatial step\nof the spiral, the wind velocities, and the orbital period. Our 3D simulation\nof WR 104 indicates that the colder, well-mixed trailing arm has more\nfavourable conditions for dust formation than the leading arm. The single-arm\ninfrared spiral follows more closely the mixing map than the density map,\nsuggesting the dust-to-gas ratio may vary between the leading and trailing\ndensity spirals. However, the density is much lower than what dust formation\nmodels require. Including radiative cooling would lead to higher densities, and\nalso to thin shell instabilities whose impact on the large structure remains\nunknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 17:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This technique combines cleaning processes, image\nsegmentation based on region growing, and morphological parameter ex- traction,\nincluding the determination of filament skeletons. The coordinates of the\nskeleton pixels, given in a heliocentric system, are then converted to a more\nappropriate reference frame that follows the rotation of the Sun surface. In\nsuch a frame, a co-rotating filament is always located around the same\nposition, and its skeletons (extracted from each image) are thus spatially\nclose, forming a group of adjacent features. In a third step, the shape of each\nskeleton is compared with its neighbours using a curve-matching algorithm.

There, the goal for nodes (hosts with IP addresses) is to discover the\nIP addresses of all other hosts. In social networks, nodes (people) discover\nnew nodes through exchanging contacts with their neighbors (friends). In both\ncases the discovery of new nodes changes the underlying network - new edges are\nadded to the network - and the process continues in the changed network.\nRigorously analyzing such dynamic (stochastic) processes with a continuously\nself-changing topology remains a challenging problem with obvious applications.\n  This paper studies and analyzes two natural gossip-based discovery processes.\nIn the push process, each node repeatedly chooses two random neighbors and puts\nthem in contact (i.e., \"pushes\" their mutual information to each other). In the\npull discovery process, each node repeatedly requests or \"pulls\" a random\ncontact from a random neighbor. Both processes are lightweight, local, and\nnaturally robust due to their randomization.\n  Our main result is an almost-tight analysis of the time taken for these two\nrandomized processes to converge.

The amplitude of the downturn correlates with the\nentire instability line for superconductivity, defining an extended quantum\ncritical region of the phase diagram as a function of nesting deviations of the\nFermi surface. One also extracts the downward renormalization of interchain\nhopping amplitudes at arbitrary low temperature in the normal phase. By means\nof analytical continuation of the Matsubara self-energy, one-particle spectral\nfunctions are obtained with respect to both energy and temperature and their\nanomalous features analyzed in connection with the sequence of instability\nlines of the phase diagram. The quasi-particle scattering rate is found to\ndevelop an unusual temperature dependence, which is best described by the\nsuperimposition of a linear and quadratic $T$ dependences. The nonFermi-liquid\nlinear-$T$ component correlates with the temperature scale $T_c$ of the\nsuperconducting instability over an extended range of nesting deviations,\nwhereas its anisotropy along the Fermi surface is predicted to parallel the\nmomentum profile of a d-wave pairing gap on the Fermi surface.

We find that anisotropic\nconduction is only important for compressible modes, as incompressible modes\nare isothermal. Modes grow faster in the presence of anisotropic conduction,\nbut growth rates do not change by more than a factor of order unity. We next\nrun fully non-linear numerical simulations of a contact discontinuity with\nanisotropic conduction. The non-linear evolution can be thought of as a\nsuperposition of three physical effects: temperature diffusion due to vertical\nconduction, the RTI, and the heat flux driven buoyancy instability (HBI). In\nsimulations with RTI-stable contact discontinuities, the temperature\ndiscontinuity spreads due to vertical heat conduction.

In spherical galaxy models, SMBH binaries stall at a\nseparation of approximately one parsec, leading to the \"final parsec problem\"\n(FPP). On the other hand, it has been shown that merger-induced triaxiality of\nthe remnant in equal-mass mergers is capable of supporting a constant supply of\nstars on so-called centrophilic orbits that interact with the binary and thus\navoid the FPP.

We also find that distance models\nwith flux ratios alone or in conjunction with light-curve information rarely\nperform better than the standard (x_1,c) model. However, when adopting a\ndistance model which combines the ratio of fluxes near ~3750 Ang. and ~4550\nAng. with both x_1 and c, the Hubble residuals are decreased by ~10 per cent,\nwhich is found to be significant at about the 2-sigma level. The weighted\nroot-mean-square of the residuals using this model is 0.130 +/- 0.017 mag (as\ncompared with 0.144 +/- 0.019 mag when using the same sample with the standard\nmodel). This Hubble diagram fit has one of the smallest scatters ever published\nand at the highest significance ever seen in such a study. Finally, these\nresults are discussed with regard to how they can improve the cosmological\naccuracy of future, large-scale SN Ia surveys.

How can\nsuch networks learn to decorrelate new complex patterns, as they arise in the\nolfactory system? Using a computational network model for the dominant neural\npopulations of the olfactory bulb we show that fundamental aspects of the adult\nneurogenesis observed in the olfactory bulb -- the persistent addition of new\ninhibitory granule cells to the network, their activity-dependent survival, and\nthe reciprocal character of their synapses with the principal mitral cells --\nare sufficient to restructure the network and to alter its encoding of odor\nstimuli adaptively so as to reduce the correlations between the bulbar\nrepresentations of similar stimuli. The decorrelation is quite robust with\nrespect to various types of perturbations of the reciprocity. The model\nparsimoniously captures the experimentally observed role of neurogenesis in\nperceptual learning and the enhanced response of young granule cells to novel\nstimuli. Moreover, it makes specific predictions for the type of odor\nenrichment that should be effective in enhancing the ability of animals to\ndiscriminate similar odor mixtures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 23:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

These lines allowed to discover the cosmological nature of\nquasars, and at present these lines allow for convenient method of weighting\nthe black holes residing in their nuclei. However, a question remains why such\nstrong lines form there in the first place. Specifically, in the case of Low\nIonization Lines, there must be a mechanism which leads to an efficient rise of\nthe material from the surface of the accretion disk surrounding a black hole\nbut at the same time should not give a strong signature of the systematic\noutflow, as the Balmer lines are not significantly shifted with respect to the\nNarrow Line Region. We determine the effective temperature of the accretion\ndisk underlying the H$\\beta$ line at the basis of the time delay measured from\nreverberation and the simple Shakura-Sunyaev theory of accretion disks. We\nobtain that this temperature is universal, and equal $995 \\pm 74$ K,\nindependently from the black hole mass and accretion rate of the source. This\nresult suggests to us that the dust formation in the disk atmosphere is\nresponsible for the strong rise of the material. However, as the material gains\nheight above the disk it becomes irradiated, the dust evaporates, the radiation\npressure force suddently drops and the material fall back again at the disk.\nTherefore, a failed wind forms. In the simple version of the model the disk\nirradiation is neglected, but in the present paper we also discuss this\nirradiation and we use the observed variation of the Broad Line Region in NGC\n5548 to constrain the character of this non-local non-stationary phenomenon.\nThe current instruments cannot resolve the Broad Line Region but future\ninstrumentation may allow to test the model directly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 23:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 13:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The novelty of these schemes lies in\nthe use of a randomly generated key for encrypting each data frame that is\ngenerated independently at both the sender and the receiver, eliminating the\nneed for any key exchange.

The reasons for this\ndisagreement are not well-understood. As these Na overabundances can be the\nresult of deep mixing, their proper understanding has consequences for models\nof stellar evolution. As discussed in the literature, part of this disagreement\ncomes from the adoption of different corrections for non-LTE effects and from\nthe use of different atomic data for the same set of lines. However, a clear\npicture of the Na behaviour in giants is still missing. To contribute in this\ndirection, this work presents a careful redetermination of the Na abundances of\nthe Hyades giants, motivated by the recent measurement of their angular\ndiameters. An average of [Na/Fe] = +0.30, in NLTE, has been found. This\noverabundance can be explained by hydrodynamical models with high initial\nrotation velocities. This result, and a trend of increasing Na with increasing\nstellar mass found in a previous work, suggests that there is no strong\nevidence of Na overabundances in red giants beyond those values expected by\nevolutionary models of stars with more than ~ 2 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 07:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

However, due to the users'\nmutual interference, this problem is in general non-convex and thus cannot be\nsolved directly by conventional convex optimization techniques. In this paper,\nby jointly utilizing the monotonic optimization and rate profile techniques, we\ndevelop a new framework to obtain the globally optimal power control and/or\nbeamforming solutions to the WSR maximization problems for the GICs with\nsingle-antenna transmitters and single-antenna receivers (SISO), single-antenna\ntransmitters and multi-antenna receivers (SIMO), or multi-antenna transmitters\nand single-antenna receivers (MISO). Different from prior work, this paper\nproposes to maximize the WSR in the achievable rate region of the GIC directly\nby exploiting the facts that the achievable rate region is a \"normal\" set and\nthe users' WSR is a \"strictly increasing\" function over the rate region.\nConsequently, the WSR maximization is shown to be in the form of monotonic\noptimization over a normal set and thus can be solved globally optimally by the\nexisting outer polyblock approximation algorithm. However, an essential step in\nthe algorithm hinges on how to efficiently characterize the intersection point\non the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region with any prescribed \"rate\nprofile\" vector. This paper shows that such a problem can be transformed into a\nsequence of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) feasibility\nproblems, which can be solved efficiently by existing techniques. Numerical\nresults validate that the proposed algorithms can achieve the global WSR\nmaximum for the SISO, SIMO or MISO GIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 10:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

As the response time of wind\nturbine is typically in the range of seconds, they are affected by the small\nscale intermittent properties of the turbulent wind. Consequently, basic\nfeatures which are known for small-scale homogeneous isotropic turbulence, and\nin particular the well-known intermittency problem, have an important impact on\nthe wind energy conversion process. We report on basic research results\nconcerning the small-scale intermittent properties of atmospheric flows and\ntheir impact on the wind energy conversion process. The analysis of wind data\nshows strongly intermittent statistics of wind fluctuations. To achieve\nnumerical modeling a data-driven superposition model is proposed. For the\nexperimental reproduction and adjustment of intermittent flows a so-called\nactive grid setup is presented. Its ability is shown to generate reproducible\nproperties of atmospheric flows on the smaller scales of the laboratory\nconditions of a wind tunnel. As an application example the response dynamics of\ndifferent anemometer types are tested. To achieve a proper understanding of the\nimpact of intermittent turbulent inflow properties on wind turbines we present\nmethods of numerical and stochastic modeling, and compare the results to\nmeasurement data. As a summarizing result we find that atmospheric turbulence\nimposes its intermittent features on the complete wind energy conversion\nprocess. Intermittent turbulence features are not only present in atmospheric\nwind, but are also dominant in the loads on the turbine, i.e. rotor torque and\nthrust, and in the electrical power output signal.

In this paper, we present a large\nsample of 87 intrinsic galactic S-type AGB stars, observed at infrared\nwavelengths with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and supplemented with\nground-based optical data.

For stars with significant dust emission, we\ndefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust species\nto the infrared flux.

We now provide a model in which a copy of the electroweak\ngauge group is added to the Standard Model. We spontaneously break this new\ngauge group to the diagonal Z_2 center which is used to stabilize a dark matter\ncandidate. In addition to the dark matter candidate, anomaly free messenger\nfermions are included which transform non-trivially under all the gauge groups.\nIn analogy to electroweak baryogenesis, the model generates an excess of\nmessenger \"baryons\". These \"baryons\" subsequently decay to the Standard Model\nand dark matter to generate an excess of Standard Model baryons. The\nbaryon-to-dark matter number density ratio is ultimately due to the requirement\nof gauge anomaly freedom. Dark sphalerons generate operators which violate B -\nL but preserves B + L. Thus, the asymmetry is not washed out by the Standard\nModel. The model radiatively generates a dark matter mass of order of the\nelectroweak vacuum expectation value suppressed by a loop factor therefore\nsetting the dark matter-to-baryon relic abundance. We outline some distinctive\nexperimental signatures and ensure these models are consistent with existing\nconstraints.

Three instruments have\nbeen analysed: MPG-2, FG5-238 and IMPG-02. The SAE has been calculated using a\nnumerical method based on FEM simulation. The observed effect has been treated\nas an additional vertical gravity gradient. The correction (SAC) to be applied\nto the computed g value has been associated with the specific height level,\nwhere the measurement result is typically reported. The magnitude of the\nobtained corrections is of order 1E-8 m/s2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 13:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2012 09:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 14:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

These numerical methods\narise from the joint spectral radius and restricted spectral radius approaches,\nwhich were shown in Charina (Charina, 2011) to characterize $W^k_p-$regularity\nof subdivision in terms of the same quantity. Namely, the $(k,p)-$joint\nspectral radius and the $(k,p)-$restricted spectral radius are equal. We show\nthat the corresponding numerical methods in the univariate scalar and vector\ncases even yield the same upper estimate for the $(k,\\infty)-$joint spectral\nradius for a certain choice of a matrix norm. The difference between the two\napproaches becomes apparent in the multivariate case and we confirm that they\nindeed offer different numerical schemes for estimating the regularity of\nsubdivision. We illustrate our results with several examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2012 14:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-14"}

However, because of some unique characteristics of MANET, TCP\ncannot offer reliable services while using e-mail, internet search and file\ntransmission in such a network. The research investigates how well the\ndifferent versions of TCP respond to various performance differentials when\nsubjected to different network stresses and topology changes, aside from\nidentifying the most efficient and robust TCP version(s) for different MANET\nscenarios. Among several TCP variants, three types are considered important for\nthe analysis, namely TCP Reno, TCP New Reno and TCP Selective Acknowledgment\n(SACK). In most cases, the TCP performance is found in our study to decrease\nwhen the node size and mobility rate is increased in the network. There is,\nhowever, exception to this. As our simulation results demonstrate, the\nincreases in the node velocity sometimes help the TCP to attain a better\nperformance. The study also reveals that out of the three variants, TCP SACK\ncan adapt relatively well to the changing network sizes while TCP Reno performs\nmost robustly in the presence of different mobility rates within MANET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 20:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-15"}
