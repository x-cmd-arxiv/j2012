However, due to the presence of the small superconducting\ngap in the {\\pi} band, the nonlinear response of MgB2 is potentially quite\nlarge compared to a single gap s-wave superconductor (SC) such as Nb.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms of nonlinearity coming from the two-band structure\nof MgB2, as well as extrinsic sources, is an urgent requirement. A localized\nand strong RF magnetic field, created by a magnetic write head, is integrated\ninto our nonlinear-Meissner-effect scanning microwave microscope [1].

Often they are signatures of the most interesting features\nof the underlying system and their prediction becomes the primary focus of the\ndata assimilation procedure. The Kuroshio or Black Current that runs along the\neastern coast of Japan is an example of such a system. It undergoes infrequent\nbut dramatic changes of state between a small meander during which the current\nremains close to the coast of Japan, and a large meander during which it bulges\naway from the coast. Because of the important role that the Kuroshio plays in\ndistributing heat and salinity in the surrounding region, prediction of these\ntransitions is of acute interest. Here we focus on a regime in which both the\nstochastic forcing on the system and the observational noise are small. In this\nsetting large deviation theory can be used to understand why standard filtering\nmethods fail and guide the design of the more effective data assimilation\ntechniques.

In the X-ray and optical light curves, we\nsearched for periodicities and variability. The optical counterpart was\nclassified using spectroscopy obtained with ESO's Faint Object Spectrograph at\nNTT. The X-ray spectra as seen in 2011 are relatively hard with a photon index\nof ~0.3-0.4 and show only low absorption. They deviate significantly from\nearlier spectra of a probable type II outburst in 2010. The neutron star spin\nperiod of P_s = 4.4208 s was discovered with EPIC-pn. The I-band light curve\nrevealed a transition from a low to a high state around MJD 54500. The optical\ncounterpart is classified to B0-1IIIe and shows Halpha emission and a variable\nNIR excess, vanishing during the 2010 outburst. In the optical high state, we\nfound a periodicity at 19.9 days, probably caused by binarity and indicating\nthe orbital period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 16:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 08:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We consider two types of growth processes on these graphs:\ndiffusion and symmetric threshold model. The diffusion process is inspired from\nepidemic models. It is characterized by an infection probability, each neighbor\ntransmitting the epidemic independently. In the symmetric threshold process,\nthe interactions are still local but the propagation rule is governed by a\nthreshold (that might vary among the different nodes). An interesting example\nof symmetric threshold process is the contagion process, which is inspired by a\nsimple coordination game played on the network. Both types of processes have\nbeen used to model spread of new ideas, technologies, viruses or worms and\nresults have been obtained for random graphs with no clustering. In this paper,\nwe are able to analyze the impact of clustering on the growth processes. While\nclustering inhibits the diffusion process, its impact for the contagion process\nis more subtle and depends on the connectivity of the graph: in a low\nconnectivity regime, clustering also inhibits the contagion, while in a high\nconnectivity regime, clustering favors the appearance of global cascades but\nreduces their size.\n  For both diffusion and symmetric threshold models, we characterize conditions\nunder which global cascades are possible and compute their size explicitly, as\na function of the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient.

In this two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, it is expected that\nplasmon polaritons and their associated optical fields can be readily tuned\nelectrically by varying the graphene carrier density. While optical graphene\nplasmon resonances have recently been investigated spectroscopically, no\nexperiments so far have directly resolved propagating plasmons in real space.\nHere, we launch and detect propagating optical plasmons in tapered graphene\nnanostructures using near-field scattering microscopy with infrared excitation\nlight. We provide real-space images of plasmonic field profiles and find that\nthe extracted plasmon wavelength is remarkably short - over 40 times smaller\nthan the wavelength of illumination. We exploit this strong optical field\nconfinement to turn a graphene nanostructure into a tunable resonant plasmonic\ncavity with extremely small mode volume. The cavity resonance is controlled\nin-situ by gating the graphene, and in particular, complete switching on and\noff of the plasmon modes is demonstrated, thus paving the way towards\ngraphene-based optical transistors. This successful alliance between\nnanoelectronics and nano-optics enables the development of unprecedented active\nsubwavelength-scale optics and a plethora of novel nano-optoelectronic devices\nand functionalities, such as tunable metamaterials, nanoscale optical\nprocessing and strongly enhanced light-matter interactions for quantum devices\nand (bio)sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 18:06:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2012 20:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We use a mechanism\nwith monotone, rank-based, rewards in a model where agents strategically make\nparticipation and quality choices to capture a wide variety of crowdsourcing\nenvironments, ranging from conventional crowdsourcing contests to crowdsourced\ncontent as in online Q&A forums.\n  We first explicitly construct the unique mixed-strategy equilibrium for such\nmonotone rank-order mechanisms, and use these participation probabilities and\nquality distribution to address the design of incentives for two kinds of\nrewards that arise in crowdsourcing. We first show that for attention rewards\nas in crowdsourced content, the entire equilibrium distribution improves when\nthe rewards for every rank but the last are as high as possible. In particular,\nwhen producing the lowest quality content has low cost, the optimal mechanism\ndisplays all but the worst contribution. We next investigate settings where\nthere is a total reward that can be arbitrarily distributed amongst all\nparticipants, as in crowdsourcing contests. Unlike with exogenous entry, here\nthe expected number of participants can be increased by subsidizing entry,\nwhich could potentially improve the expected quality of the best contribution.\nHowever, we show that free entry is dominated by taxing entry- making all\nentrants pay a small fee, which is rebated to the winner along with whatever\nrewards were already assigned, can improve the quality of the best contribution\nover a winner-take-all contest with no taxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 18:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Despite these strong\nconstraints, we construct simple electrical pulse sequences that, for small\ngradients, carry out z-axis rotations while canceling errors up to the sixth\norder in gradient fluctuations, and for large gradients, carry out arbitrary\nrotations while canceling the leading order error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 20:59:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 02:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-04"}

We study two formulations for the system\nand the relation between them. The first, Dyson's Brownian motion model, has an\ninteraction coupling constant determined by the parameter beta > 0. When beta =\n1,2 and 4, this model can be regarded as a stochastic realization of the\neigenvalue statistics of Gaussian random matrices. The second system comes from\nDunkl processes, which are defined using differential-difference operators\n(Dunkl operators) associated with finite abstract vector sets called root\nsystems. When the type-A root system is specified, Dunkl processes constitute a\none-parameter system similar to Dyson's model, with the difference that its\nparticles interchange positions spontaneously. We prove that the type-A Dunkl\nprocesses with parameter k > 0 starting from any symmetric initial\nconfiguration are equivalent to Dyson's model with the parameter beta = 2k. We\nfocus on the intertwining operators, since they play a central role in the\nmathematical theory of Dunkl operators, but their general closed form is not\nyet known. Using the equivalence between symmetric Dunkl processes and Dyson's\nmodel, we extract the effect of the intertwining operator of type A on\nsymmetric polynomials from these processes' transition probability densities.\nIn the strong coupling limit, the intertwining operator maps all symmetric\npolynomials onto a function of the sum of their variables. In this limit,\nDyson's model freezes, and it becomes a deterministic process with a final\nconfiguration proportional to the roots of the Hermite polynomials multiplied\nby the square root of the process time, while being independent of the initial\nconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 21:37:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2012 03:24:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 05:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

These QAM play the role\nof Landauer channels in a system with discrete energy spectrum and the\neigenfunctions that cannot be described as plane waves. In order to determine\nthe type of correlations that exist between the direction and magnitudes of\neach QAM and the average direction of energy and probability fluxes we have\nnumerically solved the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation describing a\nsingle particle trapped in a parabolic potential well which is perturbed by\nstochastic 'ripples'.

Models of magnetic braking can also explain the evolution of\nclose binary systems, including cataclysmic variables. The well-known period\ngap in the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variable systems\nindicates that magnetic braking must be significantly disrupted in secondaries\nthat are fully convective. However, activity studies show that fully convective\nstars are some of the most active stars observed in young open clusters. There\nis therefore conflicting evidence about what happens to magnetic activity in\nfully convective stars.\n  Results from spectro-polarimetric studies of cool stars have found that the\nfield morphologies and field strengths are dependent on spectral type and\nrotation rate. While rapidly rotating stars with radiative cores show strong,\ncomplex magnetic fields, they have relatively weak dipole components. Fully\nconvective stars that are rapidly rotating also possess strong magnetic fields,\nbut their configurations are much simpler; often close to dipole fields. How\nthis change in field geometry affects the stellar wind is the focus of several\nongoing modelling efforts. Initial results suggest that rapidly rotating active\ndwarfs drive much stronger winds, about two orders of magnitude larger than\nthose on the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 01:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-24"}

Statistically significant samples of strong lenses provide a\npowerful method for measuring the mass-density parameters of the lensing\npopulation, but results can only be generalized to the parent population if the\nlensing selection biases are sufficiently understood. We perform controlled\nMonte Carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys in order to quantify the\nbias of lenses relative to parent galaxies in velocity dispersion, mass axis\nratio, and mass density profile. For parameters typical of the SLACS and BELLS\nsurveys, we find: (1) no significant mass axis ratio detection bias of lenses\nrelative to parent galaxies; (2) a very small detection bias toward shallow\nmass density profiles, which is likely negligible compared to other sources of\nuncertainty in this parameter; (3) a detection bias towards smaller Einstein\nradius for systems drawn from parent populations with group- and cluster-scale\nlensing masses; and (4) a lens-modeling bias towards larger velocity\ndispersions for systems drawn from parent samples with sub-arcsecond mean\nEinstein radii. This last finding indicates that the incorporation of\nvelocity-dispersion upper limits of \\textit{non-lenses} is an important\ningredient for unbiased analyses of spectroscopically selected lens samples. In\ngeneral we find that the completeness of spectroscopic lens surveys in the\nplane of Einstein radius and mass-density profile power-law index is quite\nuniform, up to a sharp drop in the region of large Einstein radius and steep\nmass density profile, and hence that such surveys are ideally suited to the\nstudy of massive field galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 05:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 06:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-18"}

We show\nthat their existence is guaranteed when certain quantized binding inequalities\nof HVZ type are satisfied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 07:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 21:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 14:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-15"}

The influence of stochastic\nacceleration on the trapping of electrons is compared to the one of cold\ninjection. It is shown that when considering a high intensity wave perturbed by\na low intensity counter-propagating wave, in the non-linear blowout regime, the\ninfluence of the colliding pulses polarizations (either parallel linear or\npositive circular) on the beam quality seems weak when the electron density is\nbelow $\\sim 10^{-3}$ critical density. The effect of a homogenous constant\nmagnetic field $B_0$, parallel to the direction of propagation of the pump\npulse, is studied in the blowout regime. Transverse currents are generated at\nthe rim of the bubble, which results in the amplification of the $B_0$ field at\nthe rear of the bubble. Without $B_0$ field the beam periodically explodes and\nre-confines, this phenomenon is suppressed when $B_0$ reaches some threshold,\nwhich is a function of the laser pulses parameters (intensity, waist,\nduration). Therefore the dynamics of the beam is modified, its maximum energy\nis slightly boosted and above all transverse emittance reduced. Moreover the\nlow energy tail, observed in the non magnetized case, can be completely\nsuppressed leading to very sharp mono-energetic beam when $B_0$ is applied. If\nthe available $B_0$ field is limited then one has to fine-tune the\nspatio-temporal shape and intensity of the colliding pulse in order to get an\nacute control on the beam quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 09:18:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2012 07:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-27"}

The focus is on applications to the theory of weak\nmeasurement, as developed by Aharonov and Vaidman and their collaborators.\nTheir development of weak measurement combined with what they call\n'post-selection' - judiciously choosing not only the initial state of a system\n('pre-selection') but also its final state - has received much attention\nrecently. Not the least has it opened up new, fruitful experimental vistas,\nlike novel approaches to amplification. But the approach has also attached to\nit some air of mystery.

Among other things, I develop the formalism not only to first order but\nalso to second order in the weak interaction responsible for the measurement.\nThis also allows me to derive, more or less as a by-product, the master\nequation for the density matrix of an open system in interaction with an\nenvironment. One particular application I shall treat of the weak measurement\nis the so called Leggett-Garg inequalities, a k a 'Bell inequalities in time'.\nI also give an outline, even if rough, of some of the ingenious experiments\nthat the work by Aharonov, Vaidman and collaborators has inspired.

A\nfew thousand knots -a factor of more than one order of magnitude higher than in\nprevious studies- are identified and their photometric properties are\ncharacterized as a function of the infrared luminosity of the system and of the\ninteraction phase. These properties are compared with those of compact objects\nidentified in simulations of galaxy encounters. Finally, and with the\nadditional use of IFS data, we search for suitable candidates to tidal dwarf\ngalaxies, setting up constraints on the formation of these objects for the\n(U)LIRG class. Knots in (U)LIRGs are likely to contain sub-strucutre. Evidence\nis found that in ULIRGs they are intrinsically more luminous than in less\nluminous interacting systems due to size-of-sample effects. Furthermore, their\nsizes and masses are similar to stellar complexes or clumps detected in\ngalaxies at z > 1, unlike local stellar complexes. The star formation in\n(U)LIRGs is charaterized by a luminosity function with a slope consistent with\n\\alpha = 2, independent of the luminosity of the system. However, it may\nflatten slightly due to, as simulations suggest, higher knot formation rates at\nearly phases of the interaction. Candidates to tidal dwarf galaxies are\nidentified in the sample.

Such features\nare frequently observed in both low mass X-ray binaries and active galactic\nnuclei.

We distinguish between gas accretion onto the halo,\nwhich occurs when gas particles cross the halo virial radius, and gas accretion\nonto the central galaxy, which takes place when gas particles cross the inner\none-tenth of the virial radius. Gas particles can be accreted through three\ndifferent channels, depending on the maximum temperature value, $T_{\\rm max}$,\nreached during the particles' past evolution: a cold channel for $T_{\\rm\nmax}<2.5 \\times 10^5$ K, a hot one for $T>10^6$K, and a warm one for\nintermediate values of $T_{\\rm max}$.

Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{107}, 163002 (2011)], a recently developed complex-scaled version of\nground-state Density Functional Theory (DFT), are studied in detail. The\nasymptotic behavior of the complex density function is related to the complex\nresonance energy and system's threshold energy, and the function's local\noscillatory behavior is connected with preferential directions of electron\ndecay. Practical considerations for implementation of the theory are addressed\nincluding sensitivity to the complex-scaling parameter, $\\theta$. In Kohn-Sham\nDFRT, it is shown that almost all $\\theta$-dependence in the calculated\nenergies and lifetimes can be extinguished via use of a proper basis set or\nfine grid. The highest occupied Kohn-Sham orbital energy and lifetime are\nrelated to a physical affinity and width, and the threshold energy of the\nKohn-Sham system is shown to be equal to the threshold energy of the\ninteracting system shifted by a well-defined functional. Finally, various\ncomplex-scaling conditions are derived which relate the functionals of\nground-state DFT to those of DFRT via proper scaling factors and a\nnon-Hermitian coupling constant system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2012 15:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
