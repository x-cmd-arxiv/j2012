This polynomial closure is typical for 2nd order\nsuperintegrable systems in 2D and for 2nd order systems in 3D with\nnondegenerate (4-parameter) potentials. However the degenerate 3-parameter\npotential for the 3D extended Kepler-Coulomb system (also 2nd order\nsuperintegrable) is an exception, as its quadratic symmetry algebra doesn't\nclose polynomially. The 3D 4-parameter potential for the extended\nKepler-Coulomb system is not even 2nd order superintegrable. However, Verrier\nand Evans (2008) showed it was 4th order superintegrable, and Tanoudis and\nDaskaloyannis (2011) showed that in the quantum case, if a second 4th order\nsymmetry is added to the generators, the double commutators in the symmetry\nalgebra close polynomially. Here, based on the Tremblay, Turbiner and\nWinternitz construction, we consider an infinite class of classical extended\nKepler-Coulomb 3- and 4-parameter systems indexed by a pair of rational numbers\n$(k_1,k_2)$ and reducing to the usual systems when $k_1=k_2=1$. We show these\nsystems to be superintegrable of arbitrarily high order and work out explicitly\nthe structure of the symmetry algebras determined by the 5 basis generators we\nhave constructed. We demonstrate that the symmetry algebras close rationally;\nonly for systems admitting extra discrete symmetries is polynomial closure\nachieved. Underlying the structure theory is the existence of raising and\nlowering constants of the motion, not themselves polynomials in the momenta,\nthat can be employed to construct the polynomial symmetries and their structure\nrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 16:02:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2012 05:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-08"}

For this purpose, we introduce the Causal Cognitive Interference\nChannel With Delay (CC-IFC-WD) in which the cognitive user's transmission can\ndepend on $L$ future received symbols as well as the past ones. We show that\nthe CC-IFC-WD model is equivalent to a classical Causal C-IFC (CC-IFC) with\nlink delays. Moreover, CC-IFC-WD extends both genie-aided and causal cognitive\nradio channels and bridges the gap between them. First, we derive an outer\nbound on the capacity region for the arbitrary value of $L$ and specialize this\ngeneral outer bound to the strong interference case. Then, under strong\ninterference conditions, we tighten the outer bound. To derive the achievable\nrate regions, we concentrate on three special cases: 1) Classical CC-IFC (L=0),\n2) CC-IFC without delay (L=1), and 3) CC-IFC with unlimited look-ahead in which\nthe cognitive user non-causally knows its entire received sequence. In each\ncase, we obtain a new inner bound on the capacity region. Moreover, we show\nthat the coding strategy which we use to derive an achievable rate region for\nthe classical CC-IFC achieves the capacity for the classes of degraded and\nsemi-deterministic classical CC-IFC under strong interference conditions.\nFurthermore, we extend our achievable rate regions to the Gaussian case.\nProviding some numerical examples for Gaussian CC-IFC-WD, we compare the\nperformances of the different strategies and investigate the rate gain of the\ncognitive link for different delay values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 16:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-02"}

In particular, the sum of this series is needed for\nan accurate description of kaon-deuteron scattering, and appears as part of the\nnucleon-nucleon potential. In this article we present some\neffective-field-theory (EFT)-based insights into this series in the case of\ntwo-nucleon systems. In particular, we discuss the fact that, if meson-nucleon\nscattering is approximated by the scattering-length term, individual terms of\nthe series are divergent, and enhanced with respect to the straightforward\nexpectation from chiral perturbation theory ($\\chi$PT). This apparently\nindicates the presence of similarly enhanced counterterms. However, we show\nthat when the series is resummed the divergences cancel, such that no\nadditional information on short-range interactions is needed to obtain\npredictions for observables after resummation. We discuss the conditions under\nwhich this resummation is justified. We show that the same issues arise in the\n$NN$ potential, where the resummed series produces poles whose appearance\nindicates the breakdown scale of the $\\chi$PT expansion for that quantity. This\ndemonstrates unequivocally that $\\chi$PT cannot be applied to compute $V(r)$\nfor distances smaller than $r \\sim 1$ fm at least in the theory without\nexplicit Delta(1232) degrees of freedom.

These models arise\nfrom the undetermined coefficients method, using a Newton's basis for\npolynomials. Although part of the final product is algebraically equivalent to\nthe well known closed Newton-Cotes rules, the algorithms obtained are not the\nclassical ones.\n  In the basic model the most simple quadrature rule $Q_n$ is adopted (the\nso-called left rectangle rule) and a correction $\\tilde E_n$ is constructed, so\nthat the final rule $S_n=Q_n+\\tilde E_n$ is interpolatory. The correction\n$\\tilde E_n$, depending on the divided differences of the data, might be\nconsidered a {\\em realistic correction} for $Q_n$, in the sense that $\\tilde\nE_n$ should be close to the magnitude of the true error of $Q_n$, having also\nthe correct sign. The analysis of the theoretical error of the rule $S_n$ as\nwell as some classical properties for divided differences suggest the inclusion\nof one or two new points in the given panel.

Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are\nderived for the special case of a homogeneous Poisson forest considering a\nsimple model for the bird's dynamics. For the same case, an equivalent\npercolation model is provided. Using this model, the phase diagram is\napproximated in Monte-Carlo simulations. This paper also establishes novel\nconnections between robot motion planning and statistical physics through\nergodic theory and percolation theory, which may be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 19:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Dust formed in the ejecta then obscures the star. In\nthis picture, the geometric expansion of the shell leads to clear predictions\nfor the evolution of the optical depths and hence the evolution of the optical\nthrough mid-IR emissions.

SN1999bw, SN2000ch, SN2001ac, SN2002bu and SN2003gm all show mid-IR\nemission indicative of dust, and the luminosities of SN1999bw, SN2001ac,\nSN2002bu and SN2003gm are dominated by dust emission. The properties of these\nsources are broadly inconsistent with the predictions of the canonical model.\nThere are probably two classes of sources. In one class (eta Carinae, SN1954J,\nSN1997bs, and (maybe) SN2003gm), the optical transient is a signal that the\nstar is entering a phase with very high mass loss rates that must last far\nlonger than the visual transient.

There are\nno cases where the source at late times is significantly fainter than the\nprogenitor star. All these dusty transients are occurring in relatively low\nmass (M < 25Msun) stars rather than high mass (M > 40Msun) stars radiating near\nthe Eddington limit like eta Carinae.

It requires no tuning and\nrelies on only three observables: (1) the redshift evolution of the stellar\nmass function for star-forming galaxies, (2) the evolution of the specific star\nformation rate (sSFR) of main-sequence galaxies, and (3) the double-Gaussian\ndecomposition of the sSFR-distribution at fixed stellar mass into a\ncontribution (assumed redshift- and mass-invariant) from main-sequence and\nstarburst activity. This self-consistent and simple framework provides a\npowerful tool for predicting cosmological observables: observed IR LFs are\nsuccessfully matched at all z < 2, suggesting a constant or only weakly\nredshift-dependent contribution (8-14%) of starbursts to the star formation\nrate density. We separate the contributions of main-sequence and starburst\nactivity to the global IR LF at all redshifts. The luminosity threshold above\nwhich the starburst component dominates the IR LF rises from log(LIR/Lsun) =\n11.4 to 12.8 over 0 < z < 2, reflecting our assumed (1+z)^2.8-evolution of sSFR\nin main-sequence galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 21:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2012 17:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The (squared) singular values of $H$ follow the law of the\nclassical Jacobi ensemble of random matrices; hence the name of the channel.\nOne motivation to define such a channel comes from multimode/multicore optical\nfiber communication. It turns out that this model can be qualitatively\ndifferent than the Rayleigh model, leading to interesting practical and\ntheoretical results.

In the case where\n$k=m_t+m_r-m > 0$ it is shown that at least $k$ degrees of freedom are\nguaranteed not to fade for any channel realization, enabling a zero outage\nprobability or infinite diversity order at the corresponding rates. A simple\nscheme utilizing (a possibly outdated) channel state feedback is provided,\nattaining the no-outage guarantee.

From our temperature based abundances, we find a gradient of -0.020\ndex/kpc and present the possibility of a broken gradient from these data, but\nnote the need to obtain more temperature based abundances at intermediate\ngalactocentric distances (~10-20 kpc) to verify whether or not this may be the\ncase.

This introduces a new, secondary\ncommunication channel in the existing system, which has been considered in the\nprior work exclusively in a steganographic context. Instead, we focus on the\nuse of secondary channel for reliable communication with newly introduced\nsecondary devices, that are low-complexity versions of the primary devices,\ncapable only to decode the robustly encoded header information in the primary\nsignals. In Part I of the work we have characterized the capacity of the\nsecondary channel through information-theoretic analysis.

When these waves overrun previously inflated\ncavities, they form a differentially rotating vortex through the\nRichtmyer-Meshkov instability. The dissipation of energy captured in the vortex\ncan contribute to the feedback of energy into the atmospheres of cool core\nclusters. Using a series of hydrodynamic simulations we investigate the\nefficiency of this process: we calculate the kinetic energy in the vortex by\ndecomposing the velocity field into its irrotational and solenoidal parts.\nCompared to the two-dimensional case, the 3-dimensional Richtmyer-Meshkov\ninstability is about a factor of 2 more efficient. The energy in the vortex\nfield for weak shocks is E_vortex ~ rho_ICM v_shock^2 V_bubble (with dependence\non the geometry, density contrast, and shock width). For strong shocks, the\nvortex becomes dynamically unstable, quickly dissipating its energy via a\nturbulent cascade. We derive a number of diagnostics for observations and\nlaboratory experiments of shock-bubble interactions, like the shock-vortex\nstandoff distance, which can be used to derive lower limits on the Mach number.\nThe differential rotation of the vortex field leads to viscous dissipation,\nwhich is sufficiently efficient to react to cluster cooling and to dissipate\nthe vortex energy within the cooling radius of the cluster for a reasonable\nrange of vortex parameters. For sufficiently large filling factors (of order a\nfew percent or larger), this process could thus contribute significantly to AGN\nfeedback in galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2012 22:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Amongst\nmany proposals, Unified Dark Matter (UDM) cosmologies are promising candidates\nas effective theories. In these models, a scalar field with a non-canonical\nkinetic term in its Lagrangian mimics both the accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse at late times and the clustering properties of the large-scale\nstructure of the cosmos. However, UDM models also present peculiar behaviours,\nthe most interesting one being the fact that the perturbations in the\ndark-matter component of the scalar field do have a non-negligible speed of\nsound. This gives rise to an effective Jeans scale for the Newtonian potential,\nbelow which the dark fluid does not cluster any more. This implies a growth of\nstructures fairly different from that of the concordance LCDM model. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that forthcoming large-scale surveys will be able to\ndiscriminate between viable UDM models and LCDM to a good degree of accuracy.\nTo this purpose, the planned Euclid satellite will be a powerful tool, since it\nwill provide very accurate data on galaxy clustering and the weak lensing\neffect of cosmic shear.

We particularly investigate the influences of\nthe LMC on the precession rate, the outer stellar and gaseous structures, and\nthe star formation history of the Galaxy. Our principals results are summarized\nas follows. The LMC-Galaxy dynamical interaction can cause \"pole shift\" (or\nirregular precession/nutation) of the Galaxy and the typical rate of pole shift\n(dot {\\theta}_{d}) is ~2 degree Gyr^{-1} corresponding to ~ 7 muas yr^{-1}.

The mean star formation\nrate of the Galaxy for the last several Gyrs can be hardly influenced by the\nLMC's tidal force. The age and metallicity distribution of stars in the\nsolar-neighborhood (7 kpc < R < 10 kpc) for the last several Gyr can be only\nslightly changed by the past LMC-Galaxy interaction.

Moreover, only by\nprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing to\ninvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. We describe\nHALOS (the Herschel-ATLAS Lensed Objects Selection), a method for efficiently\nselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surface\ndensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the\n100 mJy flux limit. HALOS will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidate\nstrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \\mu>2) over the full H-ATLAS\nsurvey area. Applying HALOS to the H-ATLAS Science Demonstration Phase field\n(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidate\nlenses are identified in the VIKING near-infrared catalog. Using the available\ninformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a\n~72% purity of the sample. The redshift distribution of the candidate lensed\nsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensed\ngalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higher\nredshifts than found in the other surveys. The counts of candidate strongly\nlensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (Lapi et al.\n2011). Even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infrared\nVIKING photometry, we show that H-ATLAS data alone allow the selection of a\nsimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiency\nclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reached\nwith a ~70% efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 10:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

However, compared with the evolution of a generalized\nthree-qubit GHZ state which has the equal initial entanglement, the ESD time of\nmixed states is later than that of the pure state. Finally, we discuss the\nentanglement distribution in the multipartite system, and point out the\nintrinsic relation between the ESD of cavity photons and the entanglement\nsudden birth of reservoirs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 12:14:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 14:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We present our deep optical observations with the Very Large\nTelescope to search for an optical counterpart of the pulsar and its nebula. We\ndetect a point-like source in V, R, and I bands whose position is within the\n1-sigma error circle of the X-ray position of the pulsar, and whose colours are\ndistinct from those of ordinary stars. We consider it as a candidate optical\ncounterpart of the pulsar. If it is indeed the counterpart, its 5-sigma offset\nfrom the radio pulsar position, measured about 9 yr earlier, implies that the\ntransverse velocity of the pulsar is in the range of 1600--2000 km s^{-1} at\nthe distance of 2--2.5 kpc, making it the fastest moving pulsar known. The\ndirection of the estimated proper motion coincides with the extension of the\npulsar's X-ray tail, suggesting that this is a jet. The tentative optical\nluminosity and efficiency of the pulsar are similar to those of the Vela\npulsar, which also supports the optical identification. However, the candidate\nundergoes an unusually steep dereddened flux increase towards the infrared with\na spectral index of about 5, that is not typical of optical pulsars. It implies\na strong double-knee spectral break in the pulsar emission between the optical\nand X-rays. The reasons for the spectral steepness are unclear. It may be\ncaused by a nebula knot projected onto the jet and strongly overlapping with\nthe pulsar, as observed for the Crab, where the knot has a significantly\nsteeper spectrum than the pulsar.

While embodiment has often been used in its trivial meaning,\ni.e. 'intelligence requires a body', the concept has deeper and more important\nimplications, concerned with the relation between physical and information\n(neural, control) processes. A number of case studies are presented to\nillustrate the concept. These involve animals and robots and are concentrated\naround locomotion, grasping, and visual perception. A theoretical scheme that\ncan be used to embed the diverse case studies will be presented. Finally, we\nwill establish a link between the low-level sensory-motor processes and\ncognition. We will present an embodied view on categorization, and propose the\nconcepts of 'body schema' and 'forward models' as a natural extension of the\nembodied approach toward first representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 14:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-03"}

The main advantage of the method is its componentwise nature, i.e. the\nfact that it allows each component of the perturbation vector to have an\nindependent bound and that the bounds and sets obtained are also given\ncomponentwise. This componentwise method does not employ a norm for bounding\neither the perturbation or state vectors, avoids the need for scaling the\ndifferent state vector components in order to obtain useful results, and may\nalso reduce conservativeness in some cases. We give conditions for the derived\nbounds to be of local or semi-global nature.

We derived the far-infrared (FIR)\nluminosity (\\lfir) from IRAS data and used it as a tracer of the SFR. We\ncalculated the HI mass, \\lfir and \\mhtwo deficiencies. The mean deficiencies of\n\\lfir and \\mhtwo of spiral galaxies in HCGs are close to 0, indicating that\ntheir average SFR and molecular gas content are similar to those of isolated\ngalaxies. However, there are indications of an excess in \\mhtwo\\($\\sim$ 50%) in\nspiral galaxies in HCGs which can be interpreted as either an enhanced\nmolecular gas content or as a higher concentration of \\mhtwo towards the center\nin comparison to galaxies in lower density environments. In contrast, the mean\n\\mhi of spiral galaxies in HCGs is only 12% of the expected value. The specific\nstar formation rate (sSFR= SFR/stellar mass) tends to be lower for galaxies\nwith a higher \\mhtwo\\ or \\mhi\\ deficiency. This trend is not seen for the star\nformation efficiency (SFE=SFR/\\mhtwo). We found tentative indications for an\nenhancement of \\mhtwo\\ in spiral galaxies in HCGs in an early evolutionary\nphase and a decrease in later phases. We suggest that this might be due to an\nenhancement of the conversion from atomic to molecular gas due to on-going\ntidal interactions in an early evolutionary phase, followed by HI stripping and\na decrease of the molecular gas content because of lack of replenishment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2012 15:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In the proposed model, each cognitive node may have\nits own individual view on each PU's distribution, and, hence, seeks to find\npartners having a correlated perception. To address this problem, a coalitional\ngame is formulated between the cognitive devices and an algorithm for\ncooperative coalition formation is proposed.

We investigate\nthe DD sequences applied to suppress the dephasing of the electron spin of the\nNV center induced by the coupling to a spin bath composed of the substitutional\nnitrogen atoms. The decoupling efficiency of various DD schemes is studied,\nincluding both periodic and periodic pulse sequences. For ideal control pulses,\nwe find that the DD protocols with the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) timing\nof the pulses provides best performance. We show that, as the number of control\npulses increases, the decoupling fidelity scaling differs qualitatively from\nthe predictions of the Magnus expansion, and explain the origin of this\ndifference. In particular, more advanced symmetrized or concatenated protocols\ndo not improve the DD performance. Next, we investigate the impact of the\nsystematic instrumental pulse errors in different periodic and aperiodic pulse\nsequences. The DD protocols with the single-axis control do not preserve all\nspin components in the presence of the pulse errors, and the two-axis control\nis needed. We demonstrate that the two-axis control sequence with the CPMG\ntiming is very robust with respect to the pulse errors. The impact of the pulse\nerrors can be diminished further by symmetrizing this protocol. For all\nprotocols studied here, we present a detailed account of the pulse error\nparameters which make strongest impact on the DD performance.
