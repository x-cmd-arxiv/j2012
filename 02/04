Assume that $B$ is a right $A$-module algebra and\nthat $A$ is a left $B$-comodule coalgebra. If the action and coaction are\nmatched, it is possible to define a coproduct $\\Delta_#$ on the smash product\n$A # B$ making the pair $(A # B,\\Delta_#)$ into an algebraic quantum group. In\nthis paper, we continue the study of these objects. First, we study the various\ndata of the bicrossproduct $A # B$, such as the modular automorphisms, the\nmodular elements, ... and obtain formulas in terms of the data of the\ncomponents $A$ and $B$. Secondly, we look at the dual of $A # B$ (in the sense\nof algebraic quantum groups) and we show it is itself a bicrossproduct (of the\nsecond type) of the duals $\\hatA$ and $\\hatB$. The result is immediate for\nfinite-dimensional Hopf algebras and therefore it is expected also for\nalgebraic quantum groups. However, it turns out that some aspects involve a\ncareful argument, mainly due to the fact that coproducts and coactions have\nranges in the multiplier algebras of the tensor products and not in the tensor\nproduct itself. Finally, we also treat some examples in this paper. We have\nincluded some of the examples that are known for finite-dimensional Hopf\nalgebras and show how they can also be obtained for more general algebraic\nquantum groups. We also give some examples that are more typical for algebraic\nquantum groups. In particular, we focus on the extra structure, provided by the\nintegrals and associated objects. It should be mentioned that with examples of\nbicrossproducts of algebraic quantum groups, we do get examples that are\nessentially different from those commonly known in Hopf algebra theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 16:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-06"}

Although\nwithin the same group they are edge-disjoint, the Menger's paths from different\ngroups may have to merge with each other. It is known that by choosing Menger's\npaths appropriately, the number of mergings among different groups of Menger's\npaths is always bounded by a constant, which is independent of the size and the\ntopology of $G$.

The\nextreme infrared luminosities of some SMGs (LIR>10^12.7 Lsun, 26/61 systems)\nimply SFRs of >500Msun yr^-1. Such high SFRs are difficult to reconcile with a\nsecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-driven\nstage in the evolution of these galaxies. Another observational argument in\nfavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than that\nof SMGs of lower luminosities (~40K as opposed to ~25K), consistent with\nobservations of local ULIRGs triggered by major mergers and with results from\nhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfer\ncalculations. Luminous SMGs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxies\nin the stellar mass-SFR plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburst\nevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario.

In particular, planetesimals in a disc supporting fully developed\nmagneto-rotational turbulence are readily excited to velocity dispersions above\nthe threshold for catastrophic disruption, halting planet formation. We aim to\nexamine the stirring of planetesimals lying instead in a magnetically-decoupled\nmidplane dead zone, stirred only by spiral density waves propagating out of the\ndisc's magnetically-coupled turbulent surface layers. We extend previous\nstudies to include a wider range of disc models, and explore the effects of\nvarying the disc column density and external magnetic field strength. [...] The\nstrength of the stirring is found to be independent of the gas surface density,\nwhich is contrary to the increase with disc mass expected from a simple linear\nwave picture. The discrepancy arises from the shearing out of density waves as\nthey propagate into the dead zone, resulting in density structures near the\nmidplane that exert weaker stochastic torques on average. We provide a simple\nanalytic fit to our numerically obtained torque amplitudes that accounts for\nthis effect. The stirring on the other hand depends sensitively on the net\nvertical magnetic flux, up to a saturation level above which magnetic forces\ndominate in the turbulent layers. For the majority of our models, the\nequilibrium planetesimal velocity dispersions lie between the thresholds for\ndisrupting strong and weak aggregates, suggesting that collision outcomes will\ndepend on material properties. However, discs with relatively weak magnetic\nfields yield reduced stirring, and their dead zones provide safe-havens even\nfor the weakest planetesimals against collisional destruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 16:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Indeed, observations and numerical simulations have\nshown that strong heating at footpoints of loops, as is the case for active\nregions, puts their coronae out of thermal equilibrium, which can lead to a\nphenomenon known as catastrophic cooling. Following local pressure loss in the\ncorona, hot plasma locally condenses in these loops and dramatically cools down\nto chromospheric temperatures. These blobs become bright in H-alpha and Ca II H\nin time scales of minutes, and their dynamics seem to be subject more to\ninternal pressure changes in the loop rather than to gravity. They thus become\ntrackers of the magnetic field, which results in the spectacular coronal rain\nthat is observed falling down coronal loops. In this work we report on high\nresolution observations of coronal rain with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT)\non Hinode and CRISP at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). A statistical study\nis performed in which properties such as velocities and accelerations of\ncoronal rain are derived. We show how this phenomenon can constitute a\ndiagnostic tool for the internal physical conditions inside loops.

We consider two particle species, each of\nwhich consisting of pointlike objects that propel with a velocity of constant\nmagnitude. Within each species, the particles try to achieve polar alignment of\ntheir velocity vectors, whereas we analyze the cases of preferred polar,\nantiparallel, as well as perpendicular alignment between particles of different\nspecies. Our focus is on the effect that the interplay between the two species\nhas on the threshold densities for the onset of collective motion and on the\nnature of the solutions above onset. For this purpose, we start from suitable\nLangevin equations in the particle picture, from which we derive mean field\nequations of the Fokker-Planck type and finally macroscopic continuum field\nequations. We perform particle simulations of the Langevin equations, linear\nstability analyses of the Fokker-Planck and macroscopic continuum equations,\nand we numerically solve the Fokker-Planck equations. Both, spatially\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions are investigated, where the latter\ncorrespond to stripe-like flocks of collectively moving particles. In general,\nthe interaction between the two species reduces the threshold density for the\nonset of collective motion of each species. However, this interaction also\nreduces the spatial organization in the stripe-like flocks. The most\ninteresting behavior is found for the case of preferred perpendicular alignment\nbetween different species. There, a competition between polar and truly nematic\norientational ordering of the velocity vectors takes place within each particle\nspecies. Finally, depending on the alignment rule for particles of different\nspecies and within certain ranges of particle densities, identical and inverted\nspatial density profiles can be found for the two particle species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 18:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

Given this, two different types of adversarial errors\nare considered: the first type considers an adversary that can replace the\ncontent of an affected node only once; while the second attack-type considers\nan adversary that can pollute data an unbounded number of times. This paper\nproves that the proposed coding scheme attains a suitable upper bound on\nresilience capacity for the first type of error. Further, the paper presents\nmechanisms that combine this code with subspace signatures to achieve error\nresilience for the second type of errors. Finally, the paper concludes by\npresenting a construction based on MRD codes for optimal locally repairable\nscalar codes that can tolerate adversarial errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 19:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 08:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

There has been a significant amount of research into the detection of a\nstochastic background of GWs from supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs).\nRecent work has shown that single continuous sources standing out above the\nbackground may be detectable by PTAs operating at a sensitivity sufficient to\ndetect the stochastic background.

Resummation follows after one factorizes the cross\nsection into the rele- vant modes. The class of observables which are sensitive\nto soft recoil effects are particularly challenging to factorize and resum\nsince they involve rapidity logarithms. In this paper we will present a\nformalism which allows one to factorize and resum the perturbative series for\nsuch observables in a systematic fashion through the notion of a \"rapidity\nrenormalization group\". That is, a Collin-Soper like equation is realized as a\nrenormalization group equation, but has a more universal applicability to\nobservables beyond the traditional transverse momentum dependent parton\ndistribution functions (TMDPDFs) and the Sudakov form factor. This formalism\nhas the feature that it allows one to track the (non-standard) scheme\ndependence which is inherent in any scenario where one performs a resummation\nof rapidity divergences. We present a pedagogical introduction to the formalism\nby applying it to the well-known massive Sudakov form factor. The formalism is\nthen used to study observables of current interest. A factorization theorem for\nthe transverse momentum distribution of Higgs production is presented along\nwith the result for the resummed cross section at NLL.

It has been shown that this is possible in the constrained\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM), but only for a very specific\nrelation between the trilinear parameter and the soft scalar mass, favouring A\n~ -2m for a relatively light spectrum, and sizable values of tan(beta). We\ndescribe here a string-derived scheme in which the first condition is automatic\nand the second arises as a consequence of imposing radiative EW symmetry\nbreaking and viable neutralino dark matter in agreement with WMAP constraints.\nMore specifically, we consider modulus dominated SUSY-breaking in Type II\nstring compactifications and show that it leads to a very predictive CMSSM-like\nscheme, with small departures due to background fluxes. Imposing the above\nconstraints leaves only one free parameter, which corresponds to an overall\nscale.

We examine the conditional independence\nproperties of the fMRI signal, i.e. its Markov structure, to find realistic\nassumptions on the connectivity structure that are required to explain the\nobserved functional connectivity. In particular we seek a decomposition of the\nMarkov structure into segregated functional networks using decomposable graphs:\na set of strongly-connected and partially overlapping cliques. We introduce a\nnew method to efficiently extract such cliques on a large, strongly-connected\ngraph. We compare methods learning different graph structures from functional\nconnectivity by testing the goodness of fit of the model they learn on new\ndata. We find that summarizing the structure as strongly-connected networks can\ngive a good description only for very large and overlapping networks. These\nresults highlight that Markov models are good tools to identify the structure\nof brain connectivity from fMRI signals, but for this purpose they must reflect\nthe small-world properties of the underlying neural systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2012 22:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-07"}

Solving these challenges\nallows working with \"Big Data\" problems that are typically high dimensional\nwith multiple (but possibly incomplete) labelings and views. While other work\nhas addressed each of these problems separately, in this paper we show how to\naddress them together, namely semi-supervised dimension reduction for\nmulti-task and multi-view learning (SSDR-MML), which performs optimization for\ndimension reduction and label inference in semi-supervised setting. The\nproposed framework is designed to handle both multi-task and multi-view\nlearning settings, and can be easily adapted to many useful applications.\nInformation obtained from all tasks and views is combined via reconstruction\nerrors in a linear fashion that can be efficiently solved using an alternating\noptimization scheme. Our formulation has a number of advantages. We explicitly\nmodel the information combining mechanism as a data structure (a\nweight/nearest-neighbor matrix) which allows investigating fundamental\nquestions in multi-task and multi-view learning. We address one such question\nby presenting a general measure to quantify the success of simultaneous\nlearning of multiple tasks or from multiple views.

The players have contrasting\nroles of maximizing and minimizing the given expression. The maximizer proposes\nvalues and the minimizer substitutes them for variables of his choice. When the\nexpression is fully instantiated, its value is compared with a certain minimax\nvalue that would result if the players played to their optimal strategies. The\nwinner is declared based on this comparison.\n  We use a game tree to represent the state of the game and show how the\nminimax value can be computed efficiently using backward induction and\nalpha-beta pruning. The efficacy of alpha-beta pruning depends on the order in\nwhich the nodes are evaluated. Further improvements can be obtained by using\ntransposition tables to prevent reevaluation of the same nodes. We propose a\nheuristic for node ordering. We show how the use of the heuristic and\ntransposition tables lead to improved performance by comparing the number of\nnodes pruned by each method.\n  We describe some domain-specific variants of this game.

An application of this is the sharing of regions enclosed by a planar\ngraph where each player's aim is to maximize the area of his share.

In a previous work, we have\ndeveloped a family of subspace codes, based upon the Koetter-Kschichang\nconstruction, which are efficiently list decodable.

Security experts have argued in favor of operating\nsystem (OS) platform switching (ex., from Windows to Unix-based OSs) or secure\nOS adoption as being one of the techniques that can potentially mitigate the\nproblems posing a challenge to successful cyber-insurance markets. In this\nregard we model OS platform switching dynamics using a \\emph{social gossip}\nmechanism and study three important questions related to the nature of the\ndynamics, for Internet-like distributed systems: (i) which type of networks\nshould cyber-insurers target for insuring?, (ii) what are the bounds on the\nasymptotic performance level of a network, where the performance parameter is\nan average function of the long-run individual user willingness to adopt secure\nOSs?, and (iii) how can cyber-insurers use the topological information of their\nclients to incentivize/reward them during offering contracts?

The analysis of AIC\nand BIC shows that the simplest cosmological constant model($\\Lambda$CDM) is\nstill most preferred by the current data, and the DGP model is strongly\ndisfavored. In addition, from the observational constraints, we also\nreconstruct the evolutions of the growth factor in these models. We find that\nthe current available growth factor data are not enough to distinguish these MG\nmodels from the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2012 12:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 07:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

To compute Marton's inner bound one has\nto solve an optimization problem over a set of joint distributions on the input\nand auxiliary random variables. The optimizers turn out to be structured in\nmany cases. Finding properties of optimizers not only results in efficient\nevaluation of the region, but it may also help one to prove factorization of\nMarton's inner bound (and thus its optimality). The first part of this paper\nformulates this factorization approach explicitly and states some conjectures\nand results along this line. The second part of this paper focuses primarily on\nthe structure of the optimizers. This section is inspired by a new binary\ninequality that recently resulted in a very simple characterization of the\nsum-rate of Marton's inner bound for binary input broadcast channels. This\nprompted us to investigate whether this inequality can be extended to larger\ncardinality input alphabets. We show that several of the results for the binary\ninput case do carry over for higher cardinality alphabets and we present a\ncollection of results that help restrict the search space of probability\ndistributions to evaluate the boundary of Marton's inner bound in the general\ncase. We also prove a new inequality for the binary skew-symmetric broadcast\nchannel that yields a very simple characterization of the entire Marton inner\nbound for this channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2012 14:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-07"}
