Funding risk breaks the bilateral\nnature of the valuation formula. We find that the equation has a recursive\nform, making the introduction of a purely additive funding valuation adjustment\n(FVA) difficult. Yet, we can cast the pricing equation into a set of iterative\nrelationships which can be solved by means of standard least-square Monte Carlo\ntechniques. As a consequence, we find that identifying funding costs and debit\nvaluation adjustments is not tenable in general, contrary to what has been\nsuggested in the literature in simple cases.

We\ndefine a comprehensive framework that allows us to derive earlier results on\nfunding or counterparty risk as a special case, although our framework is more\nthan the sum of such special cases.

On the other hand, Ulysses data also suggest that the solar wind may\nrotate in two opposite ways between the northern and southern hemispheres. We\nshow that this result is not as surprising as it may seem and that it emerges\nnaturally from the ideal MHD equations. Specifically, counterrotating jets\nneither contradict the magnetocentrifugal driving of the flow nor prevent\nextraction of angular momentum from the disk. The demonstration of this result\nis shown by combining the ideal MHD equations for steady axisymmetric flows.\nProvided that the jet is decelerated below some given threshold beyond the\nAlfven surface, the flow will change its direction of rotation locally or\nglobally. Counterrotation is also possible for only some layers of the outflow\nat specific altitudes along the jet axis. We conclude that the counterrotation\nof winds or jets with respect to the source, star or disk, is not in\ncontradiction with the magnetocentrifugal driving paradigm.

In the simplest case of two sites or a fully connected\nunderlying random walk kernel, there is a single condensate hopping over $S$ as\na continuous-time random walk. In the non fully connected case several\ncondensates can coexist and exchange mass via intermediate sites in an\ninteresting coarsening process, which consists of a mixture of a diffusive\nmotion and a jump process, until a single condensate is formed. Our result is\nbased on a general two-scale form of the generator, with a fast-scale neutral\nWright-Fisher diffusion and a slow-scale deterministic motion.

Herein, we propose a novel theoretical\nframework, spatio-temporal Granger causality, which allows us to more reliably\nand precisely estimate the Granger causality from experimental datasets\npossessing time-varying properties caused by physiological oscillations. Within\nthis framework, Granger causality is redefined as a global index measuring the\ndirected information flow between two time series with time-varying properties.\nBoth theoretical analyses and numerical examples demonstrate that Granger\ncausality is a monotonically increasing function of the temporal resolution\nused in the estimation. This is consistent with the general principle of coarse\ngraining, which causes information loss by smoothing out very fine-scale\ndetails in time and space. Our results confirm that the Granger causality at\nthe finer spatio-temporal scales considerably outperforms the traditional\napproach in terms of an improved consistency between two resting-state scans of\nthe same subject. To optimally estimate the Granger causality, the proposed\ntheoretical framework is implemented through a combination of several\napproaches, such as dividing the optimal time window and estimating the\nparameters at the fine temporal and spatial scales. Taken together, our\napproach provides a novel and robust framework for estimating the Granger\ncausality from fMRI, EEG, and other related data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 03:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 00:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 19:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 16:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

From the evolutionary study of HMI intensity and AIA channels, it is\nobserved that the AR consists of two major rotating sunspots one connected to\nflare-prone region and another with CME. The constructed space-time intensity\nmaps reveal that the sunspots exhibited peak rotation rates coinciding with the\noccurrence of the major eruptive events.

They are unique laboratories to\ninvestigate the most extreme star formation, and its connection to\nsuper-massive black hole growth. The AGN and SB relative contributions to the\ntotal output in these objects is still debated. Our aim is to disentangle the\nAGN and SB emission of a sample of thirteen HLIRG. We have studied the MIR low\nresolution spectra of a sample of thirteen HLIRG obtained with the IRS on board\nSpitzer. The 5-8 {\\mu}m range is an optimal window to detect AGN activity even\nin a heavily obscured environment. We performed a SB/AGN decomposition of the\ncontinuum using templates, successfully applied for ULIRG in previous works.\nThe MIR spectra of all sources is largely dominated by AGN emission. Converting\nthe 6 {\\mu}m luminosity into IR luminosity, we found that ~80% of the sample\nshows an IR output dominated by the AGN emission. However, the SB activity is\nsignificant in all sources (mean SB contribution ~30%), showing star formation\nrates ~300-3000 solar masses per year. Using X-ray and MIR data we estimated\nthe dust covering factor (CF) of these HLIRG, finding that a significant\nfraction presents a CF consistent with unity. Along with the high X-ray\nabsorption shown by these sources, this suggests that large amounts of dust and\ngas enshroud the nucleus of these HLIRG, as also observed in ULIRG. Our results\nare in agreement with previous studies of the IR SED of HLIRG using radiative\ntransfer models, and we find strong evidence that all HLIRG harbour an AGN.\nThis work provides further support to the idea that AGN and SB are both crucial\nto understand the properties of HLIRG. Our study of the CF supports the\nhypothesis that HLIRG can be divided in two different populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 06:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-11"}

For example, a\nuser's impression of an audiobook presumably depends on aspects such as the\nstory and the narrator, and knowing their opinions on these aspects may help us\nto recommend better products. In this paper, we build models for rating systems\nin which such dimensions are explicit, in the sense that users leave separate\nratings for each aspect of a product. By introducing new corpora consisting of\nfive million reviews, rated with between three and six aspects, we evaluate our\nmodels on three prediction tasks: First, we use our model to uncover which\nparts of a review discuss which of the rated aspects. Second, we use our model\nto summarize reviews, which for us means finding the sentences that best\nexplain a user's rating. Finally, since aspect ratings are optional in many of\nthe datasets we consider, we use our model to recover those ratings that are\nmissing from a user's evaluation. Our model matches state-of-the-art approaches\non existing small-scale datasets, while scaling to the real-world datasets we\nintroduce.

We explore\nthe possibility to search for spin correlations far above the magnetic ordering\ntemperature and for anomalies in the magnon lifetime in the magnetically\nordered state by probing exciton-magnon sidebands of the spin-forbidden\ncrystal-field transitions of the Cr3+ ions (spin S = 3/2). In CuCrO2 and\nalpha-CaCr2O4 the appearance of fine structures below T_N is assigned to magnon\nsidebands by comparison with neutron scattering results. The temperature\ndependence of the line width of the most intense sidebands in both compounds\ncan be described by an Arrhenius law. For CuCrO2 the sideband associated with\nthe 4A2 -> 2T2 transition can be observed even above T_N. Its line width does\nnot show a kink at the magnetic ordering temperature and can alternatively be\ndescribed by a Z2 vortex scenario proposed previously for similar materials.\nThe exciton-magnon features in alpha-CaCr2O4 are more complex due to the\northorhombic distortion.

This theory is based on a symbolic representation of a\nfractal state-space geometry which is invariant under the action of\ndeterministic and locally causal dynamics. This symbolic representation is\nconstructed from self-similar families of quaternionic operators. Using\nnumber-theoretic properties of the cosine function, the statistical properties\nof the symbolic representation of the invariant set are shown to be consistent\nwith the contextual requirements of the Kochen-Specker theorem, are not\nconstrained by Bell inequalities, and mirror the statistics of entangled\nqubits. These number-theoretic properties in turn reflect the sparseness of the\ninvariant set in state space, and relate to the metaphysical notion of\ncounterfactual incompleteness. Using the concept of probability, the complex\nHilbert Space can be considered the completion of this symbolic representation\ninto the state space continuum. As a result, it is proposed that the complex\nHilbert Space should merely be considered a computational convenience in the\nlight of the algorithmic intractability of the invariant set geometry, and\nconsequently the superposed state should not be considered a fundamental aspect\nof physical theory. The physical basis for the proposed theory is relativistic\ngravity; for example the symbols used to describe the invariant set themselves\nlabel gravitationally distinct cosmological space-times. This implies that the\nvery notion of a `quantum theory of gravity' may be profoundly misguided -\nerroneously putting the quantum cart before the gravitational horse. Here some\nelements of an alternative `gravitational theory of the quantum' are proposed,\nbased on a deterministic and locally causal theory of gravity which extends\ngeneral relativity by being geometric in both space-time and state space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 08:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 May 2013 07:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-21"}

The delay time distribution of type Ia supernovae recently revealed\nby type Ia supernova surveys is incorporated self-consistently into the new\nmodel. The principle results are summarized as follows. The present gas mass\nfraction and stellar metallicity as well as the higher [Ba/Fe] in metal-poor\nstars at [Fe/H]<-1.5 can be more self-consistently explained by models with\nsteeper initial mass functions. The observed higher [Mg/Fe] (> 0.3) at [Fe/H] ~\n-0.6 and higher [Ba/Fe] (>0.5) at [Fe/H] ~ -0.3 can be due to significantly\nenhanced star formation about 2 Gyr ago. The observed overall [Ca/Fe]-[Fe/H]\nrelation and remarkably low [Ca/Fe] (<-0.2) at [Fe/H]>-0.6 are consistent with\nmodels with short-delay supernova Ia and with the more efficient loss of Ca\npossibly caused by an explosion mechanism of type II supernovae. Although the\nmetallicity distribution functions do not show double peaks in the models with\na starburst about 2 Gyr ago, they show characteristic double peaks in the\nmodels with double starbursts at ~200 Myr and ~2 Gyr ago. The observed apparent\ndip of [Fe/H] around ~1.5 Gyr ago in the age--metallicity relation can be\nreproduced by models in which a large amount (~10^9 M_{sun}) of metal-poor\n([Fe/H]<-1) gas can be accreted onto the LMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 10:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A structured discrete model is\nbuilt, taking into account all biological information we were able to find,\nincluding the environmental variability implemented by means of stochastic\nparameters (coefficients of fertility, death, etc.). This model is based on a\nstructure with 7 age classes, i.e. a Leslie mathematical population modeling\ntype and it is calibrated with laboratory data provided by the Department of\nEvolutionary Biology (DEB) of Florence (Italy). The model presents many\ninteresting aspects: the population has a high initial growth, then it\nstabilizes similarly to the logistic growth, but then it exhibits oscillations\n(a kind of limit-cycle attractor in the phase plane). The sensitivity analysis\nshows a good resilience of the model and, for low values of reproductive female\nfraction, the fluctuations may eventually lead to the extinction of the\nspecies: this fact might be exploited as a controlling factor. Moreover, the\nprobability of extinction is valuated with an inverse Gaussian that indicates a\nhigh resilience of the species, confirmed by experimental data and field\nobservation: this species has diffused in Italy since 1989 and it has shown a\nnatural tendency to grow. Finally, the spatial mobility is introduced in the\nmodel, simulating the movement of the crayfishes in a virtual lake of\nelliptical form by means of simple cinematic rules encouraging the movement\ntowards the banks of the catchment (as it happens in reality) while a random\nwalk is imposed when the banks are reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 10:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

In the\ninstructive approximation of a single EF, we find that the constraints from the\nfit already turn out to be quite predictive, in both cases of an EF mixed or\nnot with SM fermions, and especially when combined with the extra-quark\n(-lepton) mass bounds from direct EF searches at the LHC (LEP) collider. In the\ncase of an unmixed extra-quark, non-trivial fit constraints are pointed out on\nthe Yukawa couplings for masses up to ~200 TeV. In particular, we define the\nextra-dysfermiophilia, which is predicted at 68.27% C.L. for any single\nextra-quark (independently of its electric charge). Another result is that,\namong any components of SM multiplet extensions, the extra-quark with a -7/3\nelectric charge is the one preferred by the present Higgs fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 11:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2013 18:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-19"}

In order to\ntrigger the accretion of gas, the core has to grow up to several Earth masses\nbefore the gas component of the protoplanetary disc dissipates. We compute the\nformation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the\nsolid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals,\nexciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. We\ncompute the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by\nforming planets, and gas-solid interactions. We find that the formation of\ngiant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their\nrandom velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula.\nMoreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also\nlarger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of\ndisc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their\nsurvival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime,\nrapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate mass\nplanets that have not started yet their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of\nthese planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have either\nmasses below 10 ME or above several Jupiter masses. To form giant planets\nbefore the dissipation of the disc, small planetesimals (~ 0.1 km) have to be\nthe major contributors of the solid accretion process. However, the combination\nof oligarchic growth and fast inward migration leads to the absence of\nintermediate mass planets.

We show that\nXENON100 and the combined set are inconsistent at least at 2 sigma level in all\nscenarios but inelastic scattering, for which the disagreement drops to 1 sigma\nlevel. Secondly we consider only the combined set and hunt the best particle\nphysics model that accounts for the events, using Bayesian model comparison.\nThe outcome between elastic and isospin violating scattering is inconclusive,\nwith the odds 2:1, while inelastic scattering is disfavoured with the odds of\n1:32 because of CoGeNT data.

We also give conditions for the almost sure\nconvergence of the angular component (in polar coordinates) of a martingale in\nthis class, including both the negatively pinched case (using earlier results\non martingales of bounded dilation), and the radially symmetric case with\nquadratic decay of the upper curvature bound. Applied to minimal submanifolds,\nthis gives curvature conditions on the ambient Cartan-Hadamard manifold under\nwhich any minimal submanifold admits a non-constant, bounded, harmonic\nfunction. Though our discussion is primarily motivated by minimal submanifolds,\nthis class of martingales includes diffusions naturally associated to ancient\nsolutions of mean curvature flow and to certain sub-Riemannian structures, and\nwe briefly discuss these contexts as well.

However, in\nweakly selected populations random fluctuations due to genetic drift are more\nsevere, and neither the distribution of fitness nor the sequence diversity\nwithin the population are well understood. Here, we briefly review the\nmotivations behind the fitness-distribution picture, and summarize the general\napproaches that have been used to analyze this distribution in the\nstrong-selection regime.

To address this challenge the cache is statically\npartitioned among the cores and the jobs are assigned to the cores so as to\nminimize the makespan. Several heuristic algorithms have been proposed that\njointly decide how to partition the cache among the cores and assign the jobs.\nWe initiate a theoretical study of this problem which we call the joint cache\npartition and job assignment problem.\n  By a careful analysis of the possible cache partitions we obtain a constant\napproximation algorithm for this problem. For some practical special cases we\nobtain a 2-approximation algorithm, and show how to improve the approximation\nfactor even further by allowing the algorithm to use additional cache. We also\nstudy possible improvements that can be obtained by allowing dynamic cache\npartitions and dynamic job assignments.\n  We define a natural special case of the well known scheduling problem on\nunrelated machines in which machines are ordered by \"strength\". Our joint cache\npartition and job assignment problem generalizes this scheduling problem which\nwe think is of independent interest. We give a polynomial time algorithm for\nthis scheduling problem for instances obtained by fixing the cache partition in\na practical case of the joint cache partition and job assignment problem where\njob loads are step functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 14:47:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 09:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 17:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-26"}

In 47 Tuc\nwe found tight relations between the colours of the stars and their abundances\nof p-capture elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content -\nwhich is expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture\nelements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age) that\ndetermines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He abundance must be\nsmall (Delta Y<0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our observations; this agrees with\nprevious analyses. There is possibly a correlation between the abundances of p-\nand n-capture elements in 47 Tuc. If confirmed, this might suggest that AGB\nstars of moderate mass contributed to the gas from which second-generation\nstars formed. Considering the selection effects in our sample (which does not\ninclude stars warmer than 11000 K and RR Lyrae variables) is important to\nunderstand our results for M5. In this case, we find that, as expected, RHB\nstars are Na-poor and O-rich, and likely belong to the primordial population.\nThere is a clear correlation of the [Na/O] ratio and N abundance with colour\nalong the BHB. A derivation of the He abundance for these stars yields a low\nvalue of Y=0.22\\pm 0.03. This is expected because HB stars of a putative\nHe-rich population in this cluster should be warmer than 11000 K, and would\naccordingly not have been sampled by our analysis. However, we need some\nadditional source of scatter in the total mass loss of stars climbing up the\nRGB to reproduce our results for M5. Finally, we found a C-star on the HB of 47\nTuc and a Ba-rich, fast-rotating, likely binary star on the HB of M5.

We\npresent here a fluid dynamics video showing experimental results and CFD\nsimulations for droplet break-up at low Weber number where the droplet is\ngenerated with negative momentum. Such droplet generation is characterized by\nthe droplet breaking up and then returning back into the nozzle. This is due to\nthe fact that during the droplet formation the surface tension begins to slow\ndown the flow velocity inside the droplet and then finally inverts the flow\ndirection, while the droplet tail still breaks off from the nozzle. Thus after\nthe break up the droplet momentum is oriented toward the nozzle. It is\ntherefore possible to observe the droplet returning into the bulk fluid.\nHigh-speed images of this particular phenomenon are shown and simulation\nresults are presented to illustrate the break up dynamics and the local\nvelocities in the droplet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 15:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

Below a critical energy\nE_c, depending on the initial condition, this distribution is Vlasov\ndynamically unstable. The system undergoes a process of violent relaxation and\nquickly reaches a quasi-stationary state (QSS). We find that the distribution\nfunction of this QSS can be conveniently fitted by a polytrope with index (i)\nn=2, (ii) n=1, and (iii) n=1/2. Using the values of these indices, we are able\nto determine the physical caloric curve T_{kin}(E) and explain the negative\nkinetic specific heat region C_{kin}=dE/dT_{kin}<0 observed in the numerical\nsimulations. At low energies, we find that the system takes a \"core-halo\"\nstructure. The core corresponds to the pure polytrope discussed above but it is\nnow surrounded by a halo of particles. We also consider unsteady initial\nconditions with magnetization M_0=1 and isotropic waterbag distribution and\nreport the complex dynamics of the system creating phase space holes and dense\nfilaments.
