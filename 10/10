Our method is based on a generalization of the Robinson-Foulds (RF)\ndistance to multi-labeled trees (mul-trees), i.e., gene trees in which multiple\nleaves can have the same label. Unlike most previous phylogenetic methods using\ngene trees, this method does not assume that gene tree incongruence is caused\nby a single, specific biological process, such as gene duplication and loss,\ndeep coalescence, or lateral gene transfer. We prove that it is NP-hard to\ncompute the RF distance between two mul-trees, but it is easy to calculate the\ngeneralized RF distance between a mul-tree and a singly-labeled tree.

ADMM achieves state-of-the-art speed by adopting a divide and\nconquer strategy, wherein a hard problem is split into simpler, efficiently\nsolvable sub-problems (e.g., using fast Fourier or wavelet transforms, or\nsimple proximity operators). In deconvolution, one of these sub-problems\ninvolves a matrix inversion (i.e., solving a linear system), which can be done\nefficiently (in the discrete Fourier domain) if the observation operator is\ncirculant, i.e., under periodic boundary conditions. This paper extends\nADMM-based image deconvolution to the more realistic scenario of unknown\nboundary, where the observation operator is modeled as the composition of a\nconvolution (with arbitrary boundary conditions) with a spatial mask that keeps\nonly pixels that do not depend on the unknown boundary. The proposed approach\nalso handles, at no extra cost, problems that combine the recovery of missing\npixels (i.e., inpainting) with deconvolution. We show that the resulting\nalgorithms inherit the convergence guarantees of ADMM and illustrate its\nperformance on non-periodic deblurring (with and without inpainting of interior\npixels) under total-variation and frame-based regularization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 18:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 19:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Spectra of these systems were obtained using spectrometers on the 6.5m\nMagellan and 5m Hale telescopes. These data allow us to constrain the rate of\ndry mergers at intermediate redshifts and to test the `hot halo' model for\nquenching of star formation. Using virial radii estimated from the correlation\nbetween dynamical and stellar masses published by Leauthaud et al. (2011), we\nfind that around 1/5 of our candidate pairs are likely to share a common dark\nmatter halo (our metric for close physical association). These pairs are\ndivided into red-red, blue-red and blue-blue systems using the rest-frame\ncolors classification method introduced in Chou et al. (2011).

After correcting for known selection effects, the fraction\nof blue-blue pairs is significantly greater than that of red-red and blue-red\npairs. Red-red pairs are almost entirely absent from our sample, suggesting\nthat damp mergers are rare at z~0.5. Our data supports models with a short\nmerging timescale (<0.5 Gyr) in which star-formation is enhanced in the early\nphase of mergers, but quenched in the late phase.

Theory states that as land tides swept by the moon cross fault\nlines, stress in the Earth's plates intensifies, increasing the likelihood of\nsmall earthquakes. This paper studied the association of the moon and sun with\nlarger magnitude earthquakes (magnitude 5 and greater) using a worldwide\ndataset from the USGS.\n  Initially, the positions of the moon and sun were considered separately. The\nmoon showed a reduction of 1.74% (95% confidence) in earthquakes when it was 10\nhours behind a longitude on earth and a 1.62% increase when it was 6 hours\nbehind. The sun revealed even weaker associations (<1%). Binning the data in 6\nhours quadrants (matching natural tide cycles) reduced the associations\nfurther.\n  However, combinations of moon-sun positions displayed significant\nassociations. Cycling the moon and sun in all possible quadrant permutations\nshowed a decrease in earthquakes when they were paired together on the East and\nWest horizons of an earthquake longitude (4.57% and 2.31% reductions). When the\nmoon and sun were on opposite sides of a longitude, there was often a small\n(about 1%) increase in earthquakes.\n  Reducing the bin size from 6 hours to 1 hour produced noisy results. By\nexamining the outliers in the data, a pattern emerged that was independent of\nearthquake longitude. The results showed a significant decrease (3.33% less\nthan expected) in earthquakes when the sun was located near the moon. There was\nan increase (2.23%) when the moon and sun were on opposite sides of the Earth.\n  The association with earthquakes independent of terrestrial longitude\nsuggests that the combined moon-sun tidal forces act deep below the Earth's\ncrust where circumferential forces are weaker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 19:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-10"}

In contrast,\nsystematic errors like those induced by the convolution with the point spread\nfunction (PSF) will not benefit from that scaling effect and will require very\naccurate modeling and correction. While numerous methods have been devised to\ncarry out the PSF correction itself, modeling of the PSF shape and its spatial\nvariations across the instrument field of view has, so far, attracted much less\nattention. This step is nevertheless crucial because the PSF is only known at\nstar positions while the correction has to be performed at any position on the\nsky. A reliable interpolation scheme is therefore mandatory and a popular\napproach has been to use low-order bivariate polynomials. In the present paper,\nwe evaluate four other classical spatial interpolation methods based on splines\n(B-splines), inverse distance weighting (IDW), radial basis functions (RBF) and\nordinary Kriging (OK). These methods are tested on the Star-challenge part of\nthe GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing 2010 (GREAT10) simulated data and\nare compared with the classical polynomial fitting (Polyfit). We also test all\nour interpolation methods independently of the way the PSF is modeled, by\ninterpolating the GREAT10 star fields themselves (i.e., the PSF parameters are\nknown exactly at star positions). We find in that case RBF to be the clear\nwinner, closely followed by the other local methods, IDW and OK. The global\nmethods, Polyfit and B-splines, are largely behind, especially in fields with\n(ground-based) turbulent PSFs. In fields with non-turbulent PSFs, all\ninterpolators reach a variance on PSF systematics $\\sigma_{sys}^2$ better than\nthe $1\\times10^{-7}$ upper bound expected by future space-based surveys, with\nthe local interpolators performing better than the global ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 19:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-23"}

The sample\nincludes galaxies both on and above the main sequence (MS) traced by\nstar-forming galaxies in the SFR-M* plane. The far-infrared data are used to\nderive dust masses, Mdust. Combined with an empirical prescription for the\ndependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on metallicity (GDR), the CO luminosities\nand Mdust values are used to derive for each galaxy the CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor, alpha_co. Like in the local Universe, the value of alpha_co is a factor\nof ~5 smaller in starbursts compared to normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs). We\nalso uncover a relation between alpha_co and dust temperature (Tdust; alpha_co\ndecreasing with increasing Tdust) as obtained from modified blackbody fits to\nthe far-infrared data. While the absolute normalization of the alpha_co(Tdust)\nrelation is uncertain, the global trend is robust against possible systematic\nbiases in the determination of Mdust, GDR or metallicity. Although we cannot\nformally distinguish between a step and a smooth evolution of alpha_co with the\ndust temperature, we can conclude that in galaxies of near-solar metallicity, a\ncritical value of Tdust=30K can be used to determine whether the appropriate\nalpha_co is closer to the starburst value (1.0 Msun(K kms pc^2)^-1, if\nTdust>30K) or closer to the Galactic value (4.35 Msun (K kms pc^2)^-1, if\nTdust<30K). This indicator has the great advantage of being less subjective\nthan visual morphological classifications of mergers/SFGs, which can be\ndifficult at high z because of the clumpy nature of SFGs. In the absence of\nfar-infrared data, the offset of a galaxy from the main sequence (i.e.,\nlog[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]) can be used to identify galaxies requiring the\nuse of an alpha_co conversion factor lower than the Galactic value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 21:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 15:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The HFB minimization includes both time-even and time-odd fields in the\nenergy functional, avoiding the commonly used \"filling approximation\". Here we\napply the method to calculate neutron pairing gaps in some representative\nisotope chains of spherical and deformed nuclei, namely the Z=8,50 and 82\nspherical chains and the Z=62 and 92 deformed chains. We find that the gradient\nmethod is quite robust, permitting us to carry out systematic surveys involving\nmany nuclei. We find that the time-odd field does not have large effect on the\npairing gaps calculated with the Gogny D1S interaction. Typically, adding the\nT-odd field as a perturbation increases the pairing gap by ~100 keV, but the\nre-minimization brings the gap back down. This outcome is very similar to\nresults reported for the Skyrme family of nuclear energy density functionals.\nComparing the calculated gaps with the experimental ones, we find that the\ntheoretical errors have both signs implying that the D1S interaction has a\nreasonable overall strength. However, we find some systematic deficiencies\ncomparing spherical and deformed chains and comparing the lighter chains with\nthe heavier ones. The gaps for heavy spherical nuclei are too high, while those\nfor deformed nuclei tend to be too low. The calculated gaps of spherical nuclei\nshow hardly any A-dependence, contrary to the data. Inclusion of the T-odd\ncomponent of the interaction does not change these qualitative findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 22:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The albedo\nhas been found to be surprisingly large (8.1$\\pm$0.9%{}), which exceeds the\nvalue known for any other comets.

Although, the original design\nwas shown to achieve better mean distortion characteristics than previous\nstudies, the proposed coding structure was leading to dramatic quality\nfluctuations. In this paper, a modification of the original design is first\npresented and then the second order statistics of the distortion is taken into\naccount in the optimization. More specifically, an extension scheme is proposed\nusing a minimum distortion variance optimization criterion. This robust system\ndesign is tested for an image transmission scenario. Numerical results show\nthat the proposed extension achieves significantly lower variance than the\noriginal design, while showing similar mean distortion performance using both\nconvolutional codes and low density parity check codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 06:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2014 08:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-04"}

A central question is to\nunderstand the regulatory processes that lead to differences in relative\nabundance variation due to external and genetic factors. Here, we present a\nmixed model approach that allows for (i) joint analysis and genetic mapping of\nmultiple transcript isoforms and (ii) mapping of isoform-specific effects.\nCentral to our approach is to comprehensively model the causes of variation and\ncorrelation between transcript isoforms, including the genomic background and\ntechnical quantification uncertainty. As a result, our method allows to\naccurately test for shared as well as transcript-specific genetic regulation of\ntranscript isoforms and achieves substantially improved calibration of these\nstatistical tests. Experiments on genotype and RNA-Seq data from 126 human\nHapMap individuals demonstrate that our model can help to obtain a more\nfine-grained picture of the genetic basis of gene expression variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 09:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-11"}

The structures which\nmaximize or minimize the number of subtrees among general trees, binary trees\nand trees with a given maximum degree have been identified previously. Most\nrecently, results of this nature are generalized to trees with a given degree\nsequence. In this note, we characterize the trees which maximize the number of\nsubtrees among trees of a given order and degree sequence. Instead of using\ntheoretical arguments, we take an algorithmic approach that explicitly\ndescribes the process of achieving an extremal tree from any random tree. The\nresult also leads to some interesting questions and provides insight on finding\nthe trees close to extremal and their numbers of subtrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 11:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-11"}

In our discussion, we highlight the use of time-dependent\ntransport as a means of gaining insight into charge relaxation on a mesoscopic\nscale. For this purpose, we studied the ac conductance of a model quantum\nconductor, i.e. the quantum RC circuit. Prior to our experimental work, M.\nB\\\"{u}ttiker, H. Thomas and A. Pr\\^{e}tre first worked on dynamic mesoscopic\ntransport in the 1990s. They predicted that the mesoscopic RC circuit can be\ndescribed by a quantum capacitance related to the density of states in the\ncapacitor and a constant charge relaxation resistance value equal to half of\nthe resistance quantum h/2e^2, when a single mode is transmitted between the\ncapacitance and a reservoir. By applying a microwave excitation to a gate\nlocated on top of a coherent submicronic quantum dot that is coupled to a\nreservoir, we validate this theoretical prediction on the ac conductance of the\nquantum RC circuit. Our study demonstrates that the ac conductance is directly\nrelated to the dwell time of electrons in the capacitor. Thereby, we observed a\ncounterintuitive behavior of a quantum origin: as the transmission of the\nsingle conducting mode decreases, the resistance of the quantum RC circuit\nremains constant while the capacitance oscillates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 11:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-21"}

We find that well-formed,\nintense magnetic polarity inversion lines (PILs) within active regions are the\nonly photospheric magnetic structures that support significant net current.\nMore intense PILs seem to imply stronger non-neutralized current patterns per\npolarity.

The\ncontradiction requires the MacDonald treatment of both non-resonant and\nresonant rotation to be rewritten.\n  The non-resonant case was reconsidered by Efroimsky & Williams (2009; CMDA\n104, 257), in application to spin modes distant from the major\ncommensurabilities.

Circulating rotation may evolve toward the\nlibration region or toward a spin rate larger than synchronous\n(pseudosynchronous spin). Which behaviour depends on the eccentricity, the\ntriaxiality of the primary, and the mass ratio of the secondary and primary\nbodies. The spin evolution will always stall for the oblate case. For\nsmall-amplitude librations, expressions are derived for the libration\nfrequency, damping rate, and average orientation.\n  However, the stability of pseudosynchronous spin hinges upon the dissipation\nmodel.

DGP model is a kind of brane-world model such\nthat the corrections to the usual gravity occurred in the large distance limit\nrelative to the distance scale of the model defined as a ratio of the brane\nPlanck scale to the bulk Planck scale. The extra dimension of this model is\nnoncompact. This model is composed with an Einstein-Hilbert action in 5\ndimensions plus an induced 4D action guarantees the existence of gravity on the\nbrane. The importance of this model is that it can explain the\nself-acceleration of our universe without use of any type of dark energy. The\nvirial mass discrepancy is an important problem in cosmology and it can be\nexplained by dark matter. This is due to our various ways in measurement of the\nmass of the galaxy clusters. One of the ways we can measure the mass of a\ncluster of galaxies is to measure the galaxy masses and then add them up to\nobtain the cluster mass. Another way is to use the virial theorem. Almost in\nall clusters the virial mass is bigger than 20-30 times from the observed mass.\nIn this proposal we show that the virial mass discrepancy can be addressed by\nthe DGP model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 14:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-11"}

However, their\nbehavior in finite dimensions is often drastically different, displaying either\nno glassiness at all or a conventional spin-glass transition. We clarify the\nphysical reasons for this phenomenon and stress the unusual fragility of the\nRFOT to short-range fluctuations, associated e.g. with the mere existence of a\nfinite number of neighbors. Accordingly, the solution of fully connected models\nis only predictive in very high dimension whereas, despite being also\nmean-field in character, the Bethe approximation provides valuable information\non the behavior of finite-dimensional systems. We suggest that before embarking\non a full-blown account of fluctuations on all scales through computer\nsimulation or renormalization-group approach, models for structural glasses\nshould first be tested for the effect of short-range fluctuations and we\ndiscuss ways to do it. Our results indicate that disordered spin models do not\nappear to pass the test and are therefore questionable models for investigating\nthe glass transition in three dimensions. This also highlights how nontrivial\nis the first step of deriving an effective theory for the RFOT phenomenology\nfrom a rigorous integration over the short-range fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 14:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-11"}

We show that BS-convergence of locally symmetric spaces implies\nconvergence, in an appropriate sense, of the associated normalized relative\nPlancherel measures. This then yields convergence of normalized multiplicities\nof unitary representations, Betti numbers and other spectral invariants.

We study, in the semi-classical approximation, the\nconvergence of the quantum density and the quantum action, solutions to the\nMadelung equations, when the Planck constant h tends to 0. We find two\ndifferent solutions which depend on the initial density. In the first case,\nwhere the initial quantum density is a classical density, the quantum density\nand the quantum action converge to a classical action and a classical density\nwhich satisfy the statistical Hamilton-Jacobi equations. These are the\nequations of a set of classical particles whose initial positions are known\nonly by the initial density. In the second case where initial density converges\nto a Dirac density, the density converges to the Dirac function and the quantum\naction converges to a deterministic action. Therefore we introduce into\nclassical mechanics non-discerned particles, which satisfy the statistical\nHamilton-Jacobi-equations and explain the Gibbs paradox, and discerned\nparticles, which satisfy the deterministic Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Finally,\nwe propose an interpretation of the Schrodinger wave function that depends on\nthe initial conditions (preparation).
