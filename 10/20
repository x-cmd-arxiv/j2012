A\nconceptually simple (even if computationally not the most efficient) way of\nsampling uniformly one among so many tilings is to introduce a Markov Chain\nalgorithm (Glauber dynamics) where, with rate $1$, two adjacent horizontal\ndominos are flipped to vertical dominos, or vice-versa. The unique invariant\nmeasure is the uniform one and a classical question [Wilson\n2004,Luby-Randall-Sinclair 2001] is to estimate the time $T_{mix}$ it takes to\napproach equilibrium (i.e. the running time of the algorithm). In\n[Luby-Randall-Sinclair 2001, Randall-Tetali 2000], fast mixin was proven:\n$T_{mix}=O(L^C)$ for some finite $C$. Here, we go much beyond and show that $c\nL^2\\le T_{mix}\\le L^{2+o(1)}$. Our result applies to rather general domain\nshapes (not just the $2L\\times 2L$ square), provided that the typical height\nfunction associated to the tiling is macroscopically planar in the large $L$\nlimit, under the uniform measure (this is the case for instance for the\nTemperley-type boundary conditions considered in [Kenyon 2000]).

This is mainly due to the limited fields-of-view and plane-of-sky\nprojected nature of previous observations. The Solar Terrestrial Relations\nObservatory (STEREO) mission launched in October 2006, was designed to overcome\nthese limitations. In this thesis, a method for the full three dimensional (3D)\nreconstruction of the trajectories of CMEs using STEREO was developed. Using\nthe 3D trajectories, the true kinematics were derived, which were free from\nprojection effects. Evidence for solar wind (SW) drag forces acting in\ninterplanetary space were found, with a fast CME decelerated and a slow CME\naccelerated toward typical SW velocities. It was also found that the fast CME\nshowed a linear dependence on the velocity difference between the CME and the\nSW, while the slow CME showed a quadratic dependence. The differing forms of\ndrag for the two CMEs indicated the forces responsible for their acceleration\nmay have been different. CMEs are known to generate bow shocks as they\npropagate through the corona and SW. Although CME-driven shocks have previously\nbeen detected indirectly via their emission at radio frequencies, direct\nimaging has remained elusive due to their low contrast at optical wavelengths.\nUsing STEREO observations, the first images of a CME-driven shock as it\npropagates through interplanetary space from 8 R_Sun to 120 R_Sun (0.5 AU) were\ncaptured.

The MF\ncontrol laws use only the local information of each agent on its own state and\nown dynamical parameters, while the mass effect is calculated offline using the\ndistribution function of (i) the population's dynamical parameters, and (ii)\nthe population's cost function parameters, for the infinite population case.\nThese laws yield approximate equilibria when applied in the finite population.\n  In this paper, these a priori information conditions are relaxed, and\nincrementally the cases are considered where, first, the agents estimate their\nown dynamical parameters, and, second, estimate the distribution parameter in\n(i) and (ii) above.\n  An MF stochastic adaptive control (SAC) law in which each agent observes a\nrandom subset of the population of agents is specified, where the ratio of the\ncardinality of the observed set to that of the number of agents decays to zero\nas the population size tends to infinity. Each agent estimates its own\ndynamical parameters via the recursive weighted least squares (RWLS) algorithm\nand the distribution of the population's dynamical parameters via maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE). Under reasonable conditions on the population\ndynamical parameter distribution, the MF-SAC Law applied by each agent results\nin (i) the strong consistency of the self parameter estimates and the strong\nconsistency of the population distribution function parameters; (ii) the long\nrun average stability of all agent systems; (iii) a (strong) e-Nash equilibrium\nfor the population of agents; and (iv) the a.s. equality of the long run\naverage cost and the non-adaptive cost in the population limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 18:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-22"}

However, previous\napproaches to CoMP face two major hurdles in HCNs. First, they usually ignore\nthe inter-cell overhead messaging delay, although it results in an irreducible\nperformance bound. Second, they consider the grid or Wyner model for base\nstation locations, which is not appropriate for HCN BS locations which are\nnumerous and haphazard. Even for conventional macrocell networks without\noverlaid small cells, SINR results are not tractable in the grid model nor\naccurate in the Wyner model. To overcome these hurdles, we develop a novel\nanalytical framework which includes the impact of overhead delay for CoMP\nevaluation in HCNs. This framework can be used for a class of CoMP schemes\nwithout user data sharing. As an example, we apply it to downlink CoMP\nzero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF), and see significant divergence from previous\nwork. For example, we show that CoMP ZFBF does not increase throughput when the\noverhead channel delay is larger than 60% of the channel coherence time. We\nalso find that, in most cases, coordinating with only one other cell is nearly\noptimum for downlink CoMP ZFBF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 19:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-22"}

However, we show that\ngalaxy color is typically more effective than luminosity as a predictor of\nmetallicity. This is a consequence of the correlation between color and the\ngalaxy mass-to-light ratio and the recently discovered correlation between star\nformation rate (SFR) and residuals from the mass-metallicity relation.

This approach allows us to study the\nevolution of various galaxy properties, including the treatment of the hot\ngaseous halo from which gas cools and accretes onto the central disc, which has\nbeen neglected in many previous studies. This method shows several advantages\nover other methods. As only the particles in the regions of interest are\nincluded, the run time is much shorter than in traditional cosmological\nsimulations, leading to greater computational efficiency. Using cosmological\nsimulations, we show that multiple mergers are expected to be more common than\nsequences of isolated mergers, and therefore studies of galaxy mergers should\ntake this into account. In this pilot study, we present our method and\nillustrate the results of simulating ten Milky Way-like galaxies since z=1.

Water masers and warm dense gas, as indicated by emission in the\nhigher-excitation ammonia transitions, are most frequently detected towards\nEGOs also associated with both Class I and II methanol masers. 95% (81%) of\nsuch EGOs are detected in water (ammonia(3,3)), compared to only 33% (7%) of\nEGOs without either methanol maser type.

However, we find no evidence for statistically significant\ndifferences in water maser properties (such as maser luminosity) among any EGO\nsubsamples.

In this study, we use a shallow water\nmodel to simulate the MJO. In our model, convection is parameterized as a\nshort-duration localized mass source, and is triggered when the layer thickness\nfalls below a critical value. Radiation is parameterized as a steady uniform\nmass sink. Slowly eastward propagating (MJO-like) signals and red noise spectra\nare observed in our simulations. In the time-longitude domain, MJO-like signals\nwith multi-scale structures are observed. In the Fourier domain, spectral peaks\nassociated with the MJO-like signals are observed. In the longitude-latitude\nmap view, quadrupole vortex structures associated with the MJO-like signals are\nobserved. We propose that the simulated MJO signal is an interference pattern\nof westward and eastward inertia-gravity(WIG and EIG) waves. Its propagation\nspeed is one half of the speed difference between the WIG and EIG waves. The\nhorizontal scale of its large-scale envelope is determined by the bandwidth of\nthe excited waves, and the bandwidth is controlled by number density of\nconvection events.

In the limiting case, it leads to a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the consistency of MLE-ICA. This necessary and\nsufficient condition is weaker than the condition known in the literature.\nSince the parameter of interest in ICA is an orthogonal matrix, a geometrical\nalgorithm based on gradient flows on special orthogonal group is introduced to\nimplement gamma-ICA. Furthermore, a data-driven selection for the gamma value,\nwhich is critical to the achievement of gamma-ICA, is developed.

These lightcurves are used to measure the amplitude, shape and phase of\nthe thermal phase effect for WASP-18b. We find that our results for the thermal\nphase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01% by systematic noise\nsources of unknown origin. At this level of accuracy we find that the thermal\nphase effect has a peak-to-peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary\neclipse depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs at\nthe same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5 degrees at 3.6 micron and\nto within about 10 degrees at 4.5 micron. The shape and amplitude of the\nthermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within the\natmosphere of the planet. We also perform a separate analysis to determine the\nsystem geometry by fitting a lightcurve model to the data covering the\noccultation and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6\nmicron and 4.5 micron are in good agreement with previous measurements and\nimply a very low albedo for WASP-18b.

All the compounds show second order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic\ntransition at T = Tc which is tunable anywhere between 83 K and 373 K with a\nproper choice of the doping level (x). The insulating ferromagnet x= 0\ntransforms to ferromagnetic metal below Tc for x= 0.1 and the insulator-metal\ntransition temperature shifts up with increasing x. The magnetization (M)\nexhibits an interesting behavior as a function of temperature and doping level.\nThe field-cooled M(T) of all but x= 0.7 compound show a cusp at a temperature\nT* much below Tc. While the Tc increases monotonically with increasing x, T*\nincreases gradually, attains a maximum value (T*= 137 K) for x= 0.6 and\ndecreases rapidly thereafter. It is suggested that the decrease of M(T) below\nT* is due to ferrimagnetic interaction between Sm(4f) and Mn(3d) sublattices\nthat promotes spin-reorientation transition of the Mn-sublattice. The observed\nanomalous feature in M(T) does not have impact on the dc resistivity. Magnetic\nentropy change (delta Sm) was estimated from magnetization isotherms.

A detailed\ndescription of the excitation spectrum can be performed by combining spectra\nfor charge and anyonic sectors. The anyonic sector is the one of a squeezed\nchain of localized interacting anyons, and hence is described by the same\nconformal field theory (CFT), with central charge c=1/2 for Ising anyons and\nc=7/10 or c=4/5 for Fibonacci anyons with antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic\ncoupling, respectively.

A number of sparse\nrecovery approaches have appeared in the literature, including l1 minimization\ntechniques, greedy pursuit algorithms, Bayesian methods and nonconvex\noptimization techniques among others. This manuscript introduces a novel two\nstage greedy approach, called the Forward-Backward Pursuit (FBP). FBP is an\niterative approach where each iteration consists of consecutive forward and\nbackward stages. The forward step first expands the support estimate by the\nforward step size, while the following backward step shrinks it by the backward\nstep size. The forward step size is larger than the backward step size, hence\nthe initially empty support estimate is expanded at the end of each iteration.\nForward and backward steps are iterated until the residual power of the\nobservation vector falls below a threshold. This structure of FBP does not\nnecessitate the sparsity level to be known a priori in contrast to the Subspace\nPursuit or Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit algorithms. FBP recovery\nperformance is demonstrated via simulations including recovery of random sparse\nsignals with different nonzero coefficient distributions in noisy and\nnoise-free scenarios in addition to the recovery of a sparse image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2012 14:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 2013 10:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-27"}
