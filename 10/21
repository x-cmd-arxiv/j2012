This has\ngiven rise to a new field, which has been christened \"homotopy type theory\". In\nthis direction, Vladimir Voevodsky observed that it is possible to model type\ntheory using simplicial sets and that this model satisfies an additional\nproperty, called the Univalence Axiom, which has a number of striking\nconsequences. He has subsequently advocated a program, which he calls univalent\nfoundations, of developing mathematics in the setting of type theory with the\nUnivalence Axiom and possibly other additional axioms motivated by the\nsimplicial set model. Because type theory possesses good computational\nproperties, this program can be carried out in a computer proof assistant.

Current specification theories are however qualitative in nature,\nand therefore fragile in the sense that the inevitable approximation of systems\nby models, combined with the fundamental unpredictability of hardware\nplatforms, makes it difficult to transfer conclusions about the behavior, based\non models, to the actual system. Hence this approach is arguably unsuited for\nmodern software systems. We propose here the first specification theory which\nallows to capture quantitative aspects during the refinement and implementation\nprocess, thus leveraging the problems of the qualitative setting.\n  Our proposed quantitative specification framework uses weighted modal\ntransition systems as a formal model of specifications. These are labeled\ntransition systems with the additional feature that they can model optional\nbehavior which may or may not be implemented by the system. Satisfaction and\nrefinement is lifted from the well-known qualitative to our quantitative\nsetting, by introducing a notion of distances between weighted modal transition\nsystems. We show that quantitative versions of parallel composition as well as\nquotient (the dual to parallel composition) inherit the properties from the\nBoolean setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2012 21:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-23"}

A simplified modeling framework considering multiple\nbeneficial mutations with equal and constant fitness advantage captures some of\nthe essential features of the actual complex dynamics, and some key predictions\nfrom this model are verified in laboratory evolution experiments. However, in\nthese experiments the relative advantage of a beneficial mutation is generally\ndependent on the genetic background. In particular, the general pattern is\nthat, as mutations in different loci accumulate, the relative advantage of new\nmutations decreases, trend often referred to as \"diminishing return\" epistasis.\n  In this paper, we propose a phenomenological model that generalizes the\nfixed-advantage framework to include in a simple way this feature. To evaluate\nthe quantitative consequences of diminishing returns on the evolutionary\ndynamics, we approach the model analytically as well as with direct\nsimulations.

Up to 1.1 kHz, our\nexperimental and numerical investigations confirm previous results showing that\nthe soundboard behaves like a homogeneous plate with isotropic properties and\nclamped boundary conditions. Therefore, according to the Skudrzyk mean-value\ntheorem (Skudrzyk 1980), only the mass of the structure M, the modal density\nn(f), and the mean loss factor eta(f), are needed to express the average\ndriving point mobility. Moreover, the expression of the envelope - resonances\nand antiresonances - of the mobility can be derived, according to (Langley\n1994). We measured the modal loss factor and the modal density of the\nsoundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, in an anechoic\nenvironment. The measurements could be done up to 2.5 kHz, with a novel\nhigh-resolution modal analysis technique (see the ICA companion-paper, Ege and\nBoutillon (2010)). Above 1.1 kHz, the change in the observed modal density\ntogether with numerical simulations confirm Berthaut's finding that the waves\nin the soundboard are confined between adjacent ribs (Berthaut et al. 2003).\nExtending the Skudrzyk and Langley approaches, we synthesize the mechanical\nmobility at the bridge up to 2.5 kHz. The validity of the computation for an\nextended spectral domain is discussed. It is also shown that the evolution of\nthe modal density with frequency is consistent with the rise of mobility (fall\nof impedance) in this frequency range and that both are due to the inter-rib\neffect appearing when the half-wavelength becomes equal to the rib spacing.\nResults match previous observations by Wogram (1980), Conklin (1996), Giordano\n(1998), Nakamura (1983) and could be used for numerical simulations for\nexample. This approach avoids the detailed description of the soundboard, based\non a very high number of parameters. However, it can be used to predict the\nchanges of the driving point mobility, and possibly of the sound radiation in\nthe treble range, resulting from structural modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2012 06:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-23"}

Here we test this hypothesis by\nestimating the dark matter halo mass for central alaxies in groups as function\nof M* and sigma*. For this we have estimated the redshift-space\ncross-correlation function (CCF) between the central galaxies at given M* and\nsigma* and a reference galaxy sample, from which we determine both the\nprojected CCF, w_p(r_p), and the velocity dispersion profile (VDP) of\nsatellites around the centrals. A halo mass is then obtained from the average\nvelocity dispersion within the virial radius. At fixed M*, we find very weak or\nno correlation between halo mass and sigma*. In contrast, strong mass\ndependence is clearly seen even when sigma* is limited to a narrow range. Our\nresults thus firmly demonstrate that the stellar mass of central galaxies is\nstill a good (if not the best) indicator for dark matter halo mass, better than\nthe stellar velocity dispersion. The dependence of galaxy clustering on sigma*\nfixed M*, as recently discovered by Wake et al. (2012), may be attributed to\nsatellite galaxies, for which the tidal stripping occurring within halos has\nstronger effect on stellar mass than on central stellar velocity dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2012 07:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 22:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Therefore, it is statistically more likely that\nhabitable Earth-like exoplanets we discover will be at a stage in their\nhabitable lifetime more conducive to supporting unicellular, rather than\nmulticellular life.

Three sources of the\nfield mechanical action - energy density gradient and the orbital and spin\nparts of the energy flow - differ by the ponderomotive mechanism, and their\nphysical nature manifests itself in the optical force dependence on the\nparticle radius a. If a is much less than the radiation wavelength, the optical\nforce behaves as a^n and integer n can be used to classify the sources of the\nmechanical action.

At first, the application of the ML method and Fisher information\nnotion in the model selection analysis is described (Chapter 1). The\nfundamentals of differential geometry in the construction of the statistical\nspace are introduced, illustrated also by examples of the estimation of the\nexponential models. At second, the notions of the relative entropy and the\ninformation channel capacity are introduced (Chapter 2). The observed and\nexpected structural information principle (IP) and the variational IP of the\nmodified extremal physical information (EPI) method of Frieden and Soffer are\npresented and discussed (Chapter 3). The derivation of the structural IP based\non the analyticity of the logarithm of the likelihood function and on the\nmetricity of the statistical space of the system is given. At third, the use of\nthe EPI method is developed (Chapters 4-5). The information channel capacity is\nused for the field theory models classification. Next, the modified Frieden and\nSoffer EPI method, which is a nonparametric estimation that enables the\nstatistical selection of the equation of motions of various field theory models\n(Chapter 4) or the distribution generating equations of statistical physics\nmodels (Chapter 5) is discussed. The connection between entanglement of the\nmomentum degrees of freedom and the mass of a particle is analyzed. The\nconnection between the Rao-Cramer inequality, the causality property of the\nprocesses in the Minkowski space-time and the nonexistence of tachions is\nshown. The generalization of the Aoki-Yoshikawa sectoral productivity\neconophysical model is also presented (Chapter 5). Finally, the Frieden EPI\nmethod of the analysis of the EPR-Bhom experiment is presented. It differs from\nthe Frieden approach by the use of the information geometry methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Oct 2012 18:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}
