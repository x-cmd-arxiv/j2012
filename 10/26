In addition, the IV curve shows hysteresis and a training\neffect, i.e. the subsequent IV loops are different from the first IV loop after\nthermal cycling. Low temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) reveals\nthat the electrical breakdown over the whole device is caused by the formation\nof electro-thermal domains (ETDs), i.e. the current and temperature\nredistribution in the device. On the contrary, at the nanoscale, the electrical\nbreakdown causes the IMT of individual domains.

It calculates a structure group of metrics\nof positive scalar curvature on M (the object we want to understand) in terms\nof spin-bordism of BG and a somewhat mysterious group R(G).\n  Higson and Roe introduced a K-theory exact sequence in coarse geometry which\ncontains the Baum-Connes assembly map, with one crucial term K(D*G) canonically\nassociated to G. The K-theory groups in question are the home of interesting\nindex invariants and secondary invariants, in particular the rho-class in\nK_*(D*G) of a metric of positive scalar curvature on a spin manifold.\n  One of our main results is the construction of a map from the Stolz exact\nsequence to the Higson-Roe exact sequence (commuting with all arrows), using\ncoarse index theory throughout.\n  Our main tool are two index theorems, which we believe to be of independent\ninterest. The first is an index theorem of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type. Here,\nassume that Y is a compact spin manifold with boundary, with a Riemannian\nmetric g which is of positive scalar curvature when restricted to the boundary\n(and with fundamental group G). Because the Dirac operator on the boundary is\ninvertible, one constructs a delocalized APS-index in K_* (D*G).

Using a large set of S. cerevisiae interactions, and a set of\n136 GO terms, we find that several of the transformed networks produce more\naccurate predictions than those obtained from the original network.

For single-CuO_2-layer La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4\n(LSCO) and Bi_2(Sr,La)_2CuO_{6+\\delta} (Bi2201), some experiments seem to\nindicate an onset of SC fluctuations at very high temperatures (2-3 times\nT_c^{max}, the T_c value at optimal hole concentration p), whereas other\nmeasurements suggest that fluctuations are confined to the immediate vicinity\nof T_c(p). Here we use torque magnetization to resolve this conundrum by\nsystematically studying LSCO, Bi2201 and HgBa_2CuO_{4+\\delta} (Hg1201). The\nlatter is a more ideal single-layer compound, featuring high structural\nsymmetry, minimal disorder, and T_c^{max} = 97 K, a value more than twice those\nof LSCO and Bi2201. We find in all three cases that SC diamagnetism vanishes in\nan unusual exponential fashion above T_c, and at a rapid rate that is\nuniversal. Furthermore, the high characteristic fluctuation temperatures of\nLSCO and Bi2201 closely track T_c(p) of Hg1201. These observations suggest\nthat, rather than being indicative of SC diamagnetism, the fluctuations at high\ntemperatures in the low-T_c^{max} compounds are associated with a competing\norder. This picture is further supported by an analysis of available results\nfor double-layer cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 18:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-26"}

The general phenomenon, which is\nreferred to as Chebyshev's bias, is that primes tend to be biased in their\ndistribution among the different residue classes $\\bmod q$. It is known that\nthis phenomenon has a strong relation with the low-lying zeros of the\nassociated $L$-functions, that is if these $L$-functions have zeros close to\nthe real line, then it will result in a lower bias. According to this principle\none might believe that the most biased prime number race we will ever find is\nthe Li$(x)$ versus $\\pi(x)$ race, since the Riemann zeta function is the\n$L$-function of rank one having the highest first zero. This race has density\n0.99999973..., and we study the question of whether this is the highest\npossible density. We will show that it is not the case, in fact there exists\nprime number races whose density can be arbitrarily close to 1. An example of\nrace whose density exceeds the above number is the race between quadratic\nresidues and non-residues modulo 4849845, for which the density is\n0.999999928... We also give fairly general criteria to decide whether a prime\nnumber race is highly biased or not.

The smallest k\nfor which G admits a k-clique covering is called local clique cover number of G\nand is denoted by $lcc(G)$. Local clique cover number can be viewed as the\nlocal counterpart of the clique cover number which is equal to the minimum\ntotal number of cliques covering all edges. In this paper, several aspects of\nthe problem are studied and its relationships to other well-known problems are\ndiscussed. Moreover, the local clique cover number of claw-free graphs and its\nsubclasses are notably investigated. In particular, it is proved that local\nclique cover number of every claw-free graph is at most $c\\Delta / \\log\\Delta$,\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph and $c$ is a universal\nconstant. It is also shown that the bound is tight, up to a constant factor.\nFurthermore, it is established that local clique number of the linear interval\ngraphs is bounded by $\\log\\Delta + 1/2 \\log \\log\\Delta + O(1)$.

We prove that these very\neccentric capture orbits spend actually a similar number of cycles in a\nLISA-like detector as those with lower eccentricities if the central MBH is\nspinning. Although the rates are higher for high-eccentricity EMRIs, the spin\nalso enhances the rates of lower-eccentricity EMRIs.

This so-called \"Schwarzschild\nbarrier\" is a result of the impact of relativistic precession on to the stellar\npotential torques, and thus it affects the enhancement on lower-eccentricity\nEMRIs that one would expect from resonant relaxation.

Unreliability of synaptic transmission is a major source of neural\nvariability: synaptic neurotransmitter vesicles are released probabilistically\nin response to presynaptic spikes and are recovered stochastically in time. The\nstochastic dynamics of this process interacts with variability in the arrival\ntimes of presynaptic spikes to shape the variability of the postsynaptic\nresponse. We use continuous time Markov chain methods to analyze a model of\nshort term synaptic depression with stochastic vesicle dynamics coupled with\nthree different models of presynaptic spiking: one model in which the timing of\npresynaptic spikes are modeled as a Poisson process, one in which spikes occur\nmore regularly than a Poisson process and one in which spikes occur more\nirregularly.

We find that regular presynaptic spiking\nincreases the average rate at which vesicles are released, that the number of\nvesicles released over a time window is more variable for smaller time windows\nthan for larger time windows, and that fast presynaptic spiking gives rise to\nPoisson-like variability of the postsynaptic response even when presynaptic\nspike times are highly non-Poisson.

Via a beautiful\nnew framework for large deviation principles in $G(n,p)$, Chatterjee and\nVaradhan gave bounds on the replica symmetric phase, the region of $(p,r)$\nwhere the answer is positive. They further showed that for any small enough $p$\nthere are at least two phase transitions as $r$ varies.\n  We settle this question by identifying the replica symmetric phase for\ntriangles and more generally for any fixed $d$-regular graph. By analyzing the\nvariational problem arising from the framework of Chatterjee and Varadhan we\nshow that the replica symmetry phase consists of all $(p,r)$ such that\n$(r^d,h_p(r))$ lies on the convex minorant of $x\\mapsto h_p(x^{1/d})$ where\n$h_p$ is the rate function of a binomial with parameter $p$. In particular, the\nanswer for triangles involves $h_p(\\sqrt{x})$ rather than the natural guess of\n$h_p(x^{1/3})$ where symmetry was previously known. Analogous results are\nobtained for linear hypergraphs as well as the setting where the largest\neigenvalue of $G\\sim G(n,p)$ is conditioned to exceed the typical value of the\nlargest eigenvalue of $G(n,r)$. Building on the work of Chatterjee and Diaconis\n(2012) we obtain additional results on a class of exponential random graphs\nincluding a new range of parameters where symmetry breaking occurs. En route we\ngive a short alternative proof of a graph homomorphism inequality due to Kahn\n(2001) and Galvin and Tetali (2004).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 22:27:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 13:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

A recently developed\ndemodulation code was applied to hard X-ray light curves in several energy\nbands observed by RHESSI. Hard X-ray spikes were selected from the demodulated\nflare light curves. We measured the spike duration, the energy-dependent time\ndelay, and count spectral index of these spikes. We also located the hard X-ray\nsource emitting these spikes from RHESSI mapping that was coordinated with\nimaging observations in visible and UV wavelengths. We identify quickly varying\nstructures of <1 s during the rise of hard X-rays in five flares. These hard\nX-ray spikes can be observed at photon energies over 100 keV. They exhibit\nsharp rise and decay with a duration (FWHM) of less than 1 s. Energy-dependent\ntime lags are present in some spikes. It is seen that the spikes exhibit harder\nspectra than underlying components, typically by 0.5 in the spectral index when\nthey are fitted to power-law distributions. RHESSI clean maps at 25-100 keV\nwith an integration of 2 s centered on the peak of the spikes suggest that hard\nX-ray spikes are primarily emitted by double foot-point sources in magnetic\nfields of opposite polarities. With the RHESSI mapping resolution of ~ 4 arsec,\nthe hard X-ray spike maps do not exhibit detectable difference in the spatial\nstructure from sources emitting underlying components. Coordinated\nhigh-resolution imaging UV and infrared observations confirm that hard X-ray\nspikes are produced in magnetic structures embedded in the same magnetic\nenvironment of the underlying components.

One important example\napplication is large scale similarity search, for which Locality Sensitive\nHashing (LSH) has emerged as the method of choice, specially when the data is\nhigh-dimensional. At its core, LSH is based on hashing the data points to a\nnumber of buckets such that similar points are more likely to map to the same\nbuckets. To guarantee high search quality, the LSH scheme needs a rather large\nnumber of hash tables. This entails a large space requirement, and in the\ndistributed setting, with each query requiring a network call per hash bucket\nlook up, this also entails a big network load. The Entropy LSH scheme proposed\nby Panigrahy significantly reduces the number of required hash tables by\nlooking up a number of query offsets in addition to the query itself. While\nthis improves the LSH space requirement, it does not help with (and in fact\nworsens) the search network efficiency, as now each query offset requires a\nnetwork call. In this paper, focusing on the Euclidian space under $l_2$ norm\nand building up on Entropy LSH, we propose the distributed Layered LSH scheme,\nand prove that it exponentially decreases the network cost, while maintaining a\ngood load balance between different machines. Our experiments also verify that\nour scheme results in a significant network traffic reduction that brings about\nlarge runtime improvement in real world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 05:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-29"}

NGC 4214 is a nearby dwarf galaxy with a\nlarge set of ancillary data, ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) to radio,\nincluding maps from SPITZER, HERSCHEL and detections from PLANCK. We mapped\nthis galaxy with MAMBO at 1.2 mm at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We extract\nseparate dust emission components for the HII regions (plus their associated\nPDRs on pc scales) and for the diffuse dust (on kpc scales). We analyse the\nfull UV to FIR/submm SED of the galaxy using a radiation transfer model which\nself-consistently treats the dust emission from diffuse and SF complexes\ncomponents, considering the illumination of diffuse dust both by the\ndistributed stellar populations, and by escaping light from the HII regions.\nWhile maintaining consistency with the framework of this model we additionally\nuse a model that provides a detailed description of the dust emission from the\nHII regions and their surrounding PDRs on pc scales. Due to the large amount of\navailable data and previous studies for NGC 4214 very few free parameters\nremained in the model fitting process. We achieve a satisfactory fit for the\nemission from HII+PDR regions on pc scales, with the exception of the emission\nat 8\\mi, which is underpredicted by the model. For the diffuse emission we\nachieve a good fit if we assume that about 30-70% of the emission escaping the\nHII+PDR regions is able to leave the galaxy without passing through a diffuse\nISM, which is not an unlikely scenario for a dwarf galaxy which has recently\nundergone a nuclear starburst.

However only a few of these\ndistant objects are known to this date. The costs of building and operating a\n10-metre class telescope limit the number of facilities and, thus, the\navailable observation time. Therefore an efficient selection of candidates is\nmandatory. This paper presents a new approach to select quasar candidates with\nhigh redshift (z>4.8) based on photometric catalogues. We have chosen to use\nthe z>4.8 limit for our approach because the dominant Lyman alpha emission line\nof a quasar can only be found in the Sloan i and z-band filters. As part of the\ncandidate selection approach, a photometric redshift estimator is presented,\ntoo. Three of the 120,000 generated candidates have been spectroscopically\nanalysed in follow-up observations and a new z=5.0 quasar was found. This\nresult is consistent with the estimated detection ratio of about 50 per cent\nand we expect 60,000 high-redshift quasars to be part of our candidate sample.\nThe created candidates are available for download at MNRAS or at\nhttp://www.astro.rub.de/polsterer/quasar-candidates.csv.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 09:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-29"}

With the\ncharacteristic base pair polarities of DNA duplex the (pyrimidine)m-(purine)n\nDNA segment is a basic unit to maintain and to accumulate the electrostatic\nenergy of DNA duplex (1). To enhance the polarities of objective DNA this HMR\ngene regulation (HMR-GR) uses the polarized magnetic field with optimal\nnucleotide exposure time for T:A and C:G base pairs (50 msec and 80 msec,\nrespectively). The targeting efficiency of HMR-GR to the objective DNA is\ntheoretically up to 25%.

The bubbles trace feedback\nthat is thought to couple the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the ICM,\nhelping to stabilize cooling flows and govern the evolution of massive\ngalaxies. However, the prevalence and duty cycle of such AGN outbursts is not\nwell understood. To this end, we study how cooling is balanced by bubble\nheating for complete samples of clusters (the Brightest 55 clusters of\ngalaxies, hereafter B55, and the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample,\nHIFLUGCS). We find that the radio luminosity of the central galaxy only exceeds\n2.5 x 10^30 erg s^-1 Hz^-1 in cooling flow clusters. This result implies a\nconnection between the central radio source and the ICM, as expected if AGN\nfeedback is operating. Additionally, we find a duty cycle for radio mode\nfeedback, the fraction of time that a system possesses bubbles inflated by its\ncentral radio source, of > 69 per cent for B55 and > 63 per cent for HIFLUGCS.\nThese duty cycles are lower limits since some bubbles are likely missed in\nexisting images. We used simulations to constrain the bubble power that might\nbe present and remain undetected in the cooling flow systems without detected\nbubbles. Among theses systems, almost all could have significant bubble power.\nTherefore, our results imply that the duty cycle of AGN outbursts with the\npotential to heat the gas significantly in cooling flow clusters is at least 60\nper cent and could approach 100 per cent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 11:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Phosphorous \\delta-doping is a\nparticularly attractive platform for fabricating scalable spin quantum bit\narchitectures, compatible with current semiconductor technology. The band\nstructure of the \\delta-layers that underpin these devices has been studied\nintensely using different theoretical methods, but it has hitherto not been\npossible to directly compare these predictions with experimental data.

Performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis with the\nWMAP seven year data and the SDSS halo power spectrum from LRG DR7 for the\nmodels of our interest, we arrive at the parameter space of the models allowed\nby the data. We illustrate that, inflationary potentials, such as the quadratic\npotential with sinusoidal modulations and the axion monodromy model, which\ngenerate certain repeated, oscillatory features in the inflationary\nperturbation spectrum, do not induce a substantial difference in the number\ndensity of halos at their best fit values, when compared with, say, a nearly\nscale invariant spectrum as is generated by the standard quadratic potential.\nHowever, we find that the number density and the formation rates of halos\nchange by about 13-22% for halo masses ranging over 10^4-10^14 solar mass, for\npotential parameters that lie within 2-sigma around the best fit values arrived\nat from the aforesaid joint constraints. We briefly discuss the implications of\nour results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 15:49:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 15:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-04"}

In particular we focus on comparing a semiclassical\napproach that describes nuclear motion in this many vibronic-states system on\nthe Ehrenfest dynamics level to a numerically exact fully quantum calculation\nbased on the Bonca-Trugman method [J. Bon\\v{c}a and S. A. Trugman, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 75, 2566 (1995)]. In both approaches, thermal relaxation in the nuclear\nsubspace is implemented in equivalent approximate ways: In the Ehrenfest\ncalculation the uncoupled (to the electronic subsystem) motion of the classical\n(harmonic) oscillator is simply damped as would be implied by coupling to a\nmarkovian zero temperature bath. In the quantum calculation, thermal relaxation\nis implemented by augmenting the Liouville equation for the oscillator density\nmatrix with kinetic terms that account for the same relaxation. In both cases\nwe calculate the probability to trap the electron in a polaron cage and the\nprobability that it escapes to infinity. Comparing these calculations, we find\nthat while both result in similar long time yields for these processes, the\nEhrenfest-dynamics based calculation fails to account for the correct timescale\nfor the polaron formation. This failure results, as usual, from the fact that\nat the early stage of polaron formation the classical nuclear dynamics takes\nplace on an unphysical average potential surface that reflects the\notherwise-distributed electronic population in the system, while the quantum\ncalculation accounts fully for correlations between the electronic and\nvibrational subsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 22:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The analysis is totally\nconsistent with the general conviction that BHs result in highly excited states\nrepresenting both the \"hydrogen atom\" and the \"quasi-thermal emission\" in\nquantum gravity. Our BH model is somewhat similar to the semi-classical Bohr's\nmodel of the structure of a hydrogen atom.
