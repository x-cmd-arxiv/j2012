In the coronal hole, 19 of 22 events have a\nsingle stable polarity which does not change its position in time. In eleven\ncases this is the dominant polarity. The dominant flux of the coronal hole form\nthe largest concentration of magnetic flux in terms of size while the opposite\npolarity is distributed in small concentrations. In the coronal hole the number\nof magnetic elements of the dominant polarity is four times higher than the\nnon-dominant one. The supergranulation configuration appears to preserve its\ngeneral shape during approximately nine hours of observations although the\nlarge concentrations in the network did evolve and were slightly displaced, and\ntheir strength either increased or decreased. The emission fluctuations seen in\nthe X-ray bright points are associated with reoccurring magnetic cancellation\nin the footpoints. Unique observations of an X-ray jet reveal similar magnetic\nbehaviour in the footpoints, i.e. cancellation of the opposite polarity\nmagnetic flux. We found that the magnetic flux cancellation rate during the jet\nis much higher than in bright points. Not all magnetic cancellations result in\nan X-ray enhancement, suggesting that there is a threshold of the amount of\nmagnetic flux involved in a cancellation above which brightening would occur at\nX-ray temperatures. Our study demonstrates that the magnetic flux in coronal\nholes is continuously recycled through magnetic reconnection which is\nresponsible for the formation of numerous small-scale transient events. The\nopen magnetic flux forming the coronal-hole phenomenon is largely involved in\nthese transient features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2012 22:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-16"}

We try to understand the star-formation stages\nof the clumps in these high extinction clouds by studying the infall and\noutflow properties, the presence of a young stellar object (YSO), and the level\nof the CO depletion through a molecular line survey with the IRAM 30m and APEX\n12m telescopes.

We find that the HCO+(1-0)\nline is the most sensitive for detecting infalling motions. SiO, an outflow\ntracer, was mostly detected toward sources with infall, indicating that infall\nis accompanied by collimated outflows. The presence of YSOs within a clump\ndepends mostly on its column density; no signs of YSOs were found below 4E22\ncm-2. Star formation is on the verge of beginning in clouds that have a low\ncolumn density contrast; infall is not yet present in the majority of the\nclumps. The first signs of ongoing star formation are broadly observed in\nclouds where the column density contrast between the clump and the cloud is\nhigher than two; most clumps show infall and outflow. Finally, the most evolved\nclumps are in clouds that have a column density contrast higher than three;\nalmost all clumps have a YSO, and in many clumps, the infall has already\nhalted. Hence, the cloud morphology, based on the column density contrast\nbetween the cloud and the clumps, seems to have a direct connection with the\nevolutionary stage of the objects forming inside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2012 14:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For larger values of the first argument, an optimization problem\nis solved, and the parameters can be accurately represented using regression\nanalysis. Numerical results indicate that the proposed methods result in\napproximations very close to the actual Marcum $Q$-function for small and\nmoderate values of the first argument. We demonstrate the accuracy of the\napproximation by using it to analyze the connectivity properties of random ad\nhoc networks operating in a Rician fading environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2012 15:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 09:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 14:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-21"}

For this reconstructed\n$H$ we have investigated the behavior of the density of the Ricci dark energy\n$\\rho_{RDE}$ and density contribution due to torsion $\\rho_{T}$. All of the\nsaid cosmological parameters are seen to have increasing behavior from higher\nto lower redshifts for all values of $c^{2}$ pertaining to the Ricci dark\nenergy.
