All four are Fermi\ngamma-ray sources and three are 'black-widow' pulsars, with companions of mass\n< 0.1 solar masses. Data were taken using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and\ncovered a full binary orbit for each pulsar. Two pulsars, PSRs J2215+5135 and\nJ2256-1024, show significant orbital variability and X-ray flux minima at the\ntimes of eclipses observed at radio wavelengths. This phenomenon is consistent\nwith intrabinary shock emission characteristic of black-widow pulsars. The\nother two pulsars, PSRs J0023+0923 and J1810+1744, do not demonstrate\nsignificant variability, but are fainter than the other two sources. Spectral\nfits yield power-law indices that range from 1.4 to 2.3 and blackbody\ntemperatures in the hundreds of eV. The spectrum for PSR J2215+5135 shows a\nsignificant hard X-ray component (41% of counts are above 2 keV), which is\nadditional evidence for the presence of intrabinary shock emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2012 16:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Therefore the single field stays closest to the hilltop\nsources the non-Gaussianity. In this case most of axions can be replaced by a\nsingle effective field with a quadratic potential. So our potential will\ncontain two fields. The full cosine is responsible for the axion closest to\nhilltop and quadratic term which is a source for Hubble rate [4].

The applications axis motivates the use of such\n\"hard-to-optimize\" energies by introducing new tasks. As the energies become\nless constrained and structured one gains more expressive power for the\nobjective function achieving more accurate models. Results show how\nchallenging, hard-to-optimize, energies are more adequate for certain computer\nvision applications. To overcome the resulting challenging optimization tasks\nthe second axis of this thesis proposes approximation algorithms to cope with\nthe NP-hardness of the optimization.

Here we develop a general geometrical\napproach, to systematically derive Hamiltonian energy functions for these\nobjects. In the case of continuous curves, we demand that the energy function\nmust be invariant under local frame rotations, and it should also transform\ncovariantly under reparametrizations of the curve. This leads us to consider\nenergy functions that are constructed from the conserved quantities in the\nhierarchy of the integrable nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE). We point\nout the existence of a Weyl transformation that we utilize to introduce a dual\nhierarchy to the standard NLSE hierarchy. We propose that the dual hierarchy is\nalso integrable, and we confirm this to the first non-trivial order. In the\ndiscrete case the requirement of reparametrization invariance is void. But the\ndemand of invariance under local frame rotations prevails, and we utilize it to\nintroduce a discrete variant of the Zakharov-Shabat recursion relation. We use\nthis relation to derive frame independent quantities that we propose are the\nessentially unique and as such natural candidates for constructing energy\nfunctions for piecewise linear polygonal chains.

Using an advanced\nionic interaction potential, the full conductivity tensor was calculated by\nmeans of the Green-Kubo method, and the conductivity of MgSiO3 post-perovskite\nwas found to be significantly anisotropic. The thermal conductivities of all\nthree phases were parameterized as a function of density and temperature.\nAssuming a Fe-free lower-mantle composition with mole fractions xMgSiO3 = 0.66\nand xMgO = 0.34, the conductivity of the two-phase aggregate was calculated\nalong a model geotherm.

To improve system throughput, a scheduling\nalgorithm is necessary to choose a subset of links at each time slot for data\ntrasmission. Throughput optimal link scheduling discipline in such a wireless\nnetwork is generally an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we develop a poylnomial\ntime algorithm for link scheduling problem provided that network conflict graph\nis line multigraph. (i.e. line graph for which its root graph is multigraph).\nThis result can be a guideline for network designers to plan the topology of a\nstationary wireless network such that the required conditions hold and then the\nthroughput optimal algorithm can be run in a much less time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2012 15:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-30"}

To address this problem first we define the\nsignal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) expression for the complete\ncooperative AF-based transmission. Next, we formulate the problem of link\nscheduling as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that uses as a constraint\nthe developed SINR expression. The proposed formulation is motivated by the\nobservation that the aggregate interference that affects a single cooperative\ntransmission can be decomposed into two separate SINR constraints.

The latter school is more philosophical than is usual with the\npractitioners of Bayesian inference and claims the existence of a world mind.\nWhen these two disciplines inform each other semiotics is provided with\nmathematical mechanism and Bayesian inference is seen to be closely related to\nthe act of distinction, the fundamental basis of logic in the work of\nSpencer-Brown. This hybridization also suggests a definition for knowledge\nwithin Bayesian inference; a definition that has been curiously lacking. Given\nthat Darwinian processes are physical implementations of Bayesian inference and\nare utilized within numerous scientific theories across a wide range of\ndisciplines as mechanisms for the creation and evolution of knowledge we may\nview the conjunction of these theories, within universal Darwinism, as\ndescriptive of a world mind. Placing the world mind in this context provides\ndetailed support from the scientific literature and goes some way to refute the\ncharges of mysticism which have been leveled at the semiotic approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2012 21:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-31"}
