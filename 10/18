However, this phenomenon is\ncomplex to measure at high energy and requires high fluxes. Cyg X-1 appears as\nthe best candidate amongst the X-ray binaries since it is one of the brightest\npersistent sources in this energy domain. Furthermore, a polarized component\nhas recently been reported above 400 keV from IBIS data. We have therefore\ndedicated our efforts to develop the required tools to study the polarization\nin the INTEGRAL SPI data and have first applied them to 2.6 Ms of Cyg X-1\nobservations, covering 6.5 years of the INTEGRAL mission.\n  We have found that the high energy emission of Cyg X-1 is indeed polarized,\nwith a mean polarization fraction of 76 % +/- 15 % at a position angle\nestimated to 42 +/- 3 degrees, for energies above 230 keV. The polarization\nfraction clearly increases with energy. In the 130-230 keV band, the\npolarization fraction is lower than 20 %, but exceeds 75 % between 370 and 850\nkeV, with the (total) emission vanishing above this energy. This result\nstrongly suggests that the emission originates from the jet structure known to\nemit in the radio domain. The same synchrotron process could be responsible for\nthe emission from radio to MeV, implying the presence of high energy electrons.\nThis illustrates why the polarization of the high energy emission in compact\nobjects is an increasingly important observational objective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 16:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Our method\nis based on a \"double-scale\" reformulation of the initial equation, with the\nintroduction of an additional periodic variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 17:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In these models, the genome is\nrepresented by a vertex of the $n$-dimensional binary hypercube, for some $n$,\na mutation involves the flipping of a single bit, and each vertex is assigned a\nreal number, called its fitness, according to some rules. Our main concern is\nwith the issue of existence of (selectively) accessible paths; that is,\nmonotonic paths in the hypercube along which fitness is always increasing. Our\nmain results resolve open questions about three such models, which in the\nbiophysics literature are known as house of cards (HoC), constrained house of\ncards (CHoC) and rough Mount Fuji (RMF). We prove that the probability of there\nbeing at least one accessible path from the all-zeroes node $\\mathbf {v}^0$ to\nthe all-ones node $\\mathbf {v}^1$ tends respectively to 0, 1 and 1, as $n$\ntends to infinity. A crucial idea is the introduction of a generalization of\nthe CHoC model, in which the fitness of $\\mathbf {v}^0$ is set to some\n$\\alpha=\\alpha_n\\in[0,1]$.

A distributed leader election algorithm is presented for\ncomplete $n$-node networks that runs in O(1) rounds and (with high probability)\nuses only $O(\\sqrt{n}\\log^{3/2} n)$ messages to elect a unique leader (with\nhigh probability). When considering the \"explicit\" variant of leader election\nwhere eventually every node knows the identity of the leader, our algorithm\nyields the asymptotically optimal bounds of O(1) rounds and O(n) messages.

While shaped\nAPSK can provide significant gains when used with standard off-the-shelf LDPC\ncodes, such as the codes in the DVB-S2 standard, additional non-negligible\ngains can be achieved by optimizing the LDPC code with respect to the shaped\nAPSK modulation.

All SHAM models we studied exhibit significant\ntension with galaxy groups observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The\nSHAM prediction for the field galaxy luminosity function (LF) is systematically\ntoo dim, and the group galaxy LF systematically too bright, regardless of the\ndetails of the SHAM prescription. SHAM models connecting r-band luminosity, Mr,\nto Vacc, the maximum circular velocity of a subhalo at the time of accretion\nonto the host, faithfully reproduce galaxy group abundance as a function of\nrichness, g(N). However, SHAM models connecting Mr with Vpeak, the peak value\nof Vmax over the entire merger history of the halo, over-predict galaxy group\nabundance. Our results suggest that no SHAM model can simultaneously reproduce\nthe observed g(N) and two-point projected galaxy clustering. Nevertheless, we\nalso report a new success of SHAM: an accurate prediction for Phi(m12), the\nabundance of galaxy groups as a function of magnitude gap m12, defined as the\ndifference between the r-band absolute magnitude of the two brightest group\nmembers. We show that it may be possible to use joint measurements of g(N) and\nPhi(m12) to tightly constrain the details of the SHAM implementation.\nAdditionally, we show that the hypothesis that the luminosity gap is\nconstructed via random draws from a universal LF provides a poor description of\nthe data, contradicting recent claims in the literature. Finally, we test a\ncommon assumption of the Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) formalism, that\nthe satellite LF need only be conditioned by the brightness of the central\ngalaxy. We find this assumption to be well-supported by the observed Phi(m12).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 15:07:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 18:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

However, the specific mechanisms by which rainbow trout\nand their hybrids outcompete cutthroat trout have not been thoroughly explored,\nand the published data is limited to lotic ecosystems. Materials and Methods:\nSamples of rainbow trout and cutthroat trout were obtained from a lentic\necosystem by angling. The total length and weight of each fish was measured and\nthe relative weight of each fish was computed (Anderson R.O., Neumann R.M.\n1996.

Carlander, 1969.\nHandbook of Freshwater Fishery Biology, Volume One, Iowa University Press,\nAmes.) was also used to generate mean weight-length curves, as well as 25th and\n75th percentile curves for each species to allow further comparison. Results:\nThe mean relative weight of the rainbow trout was 72.5 (+/- 2.1); whereas, the\nmean relative weight of the cutthroat trout was 101.0 (+/- 4.9). The rainbow\ntrout were thin; 80% weighed below the 25th percentile. The cutthroat trout\nwere plump; 86% weighed above the 75th percentile, and 29% were above the\nheaviest recorded specimens at a given length in the Carlander (1969) data set.\nConclusion: This data casts doubt on the hypothesis that rainbow trout are\nstrong food competitors with cutthroat trout in lentic ecosystems. On the\ncontrary, in the lake under study, the cutthroat trout seem to be outcompeting\nrainbow trout for the available food.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 20:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

Fatigue describes the crack formation\nin the material under cyclic loading. Activation and deactivation operations of\ntechnical units are important examples in engineering where fatigue and\nespecially low-cycle fatigue (LCF) play an essential role. A significant\nscatter in fatigue life for many materials results in the necessity of advanced\nprobabilistic models for fatigue. Moreover, optimization of reliability is of\nvital interest in engineering, where with respect to fatigue the cost\nfunctionals are motivated by the predicted probability for the integrity of the\ncomponent after a certain number of load cycles. The natural mathematical\nlanguage to model failure, here understood as crack initiation, is the language\nof spatio-temporal point processes and their first failure times. This\ntranslates the problem of optimal reliability in the framework of shape\noptimization. The cost functionals derived in this way for realistic optimal\nreliability problems are too singular to be $H^1$-lower semi-continuous as many\ndamage mechanisms, like LCF, lead to crack initiation as a function of the\nstress at the component's surface. Realistic crack formation models therefore\nimpose a new challenge to the theory of shape optimization. In this work, we\nhave to modify the existence proof of optimal shapes, for the case of\nsufficiently smooth shapes using elliptic regularity, uniform Schauder\nestimates and compactness of strong solutions via the Arzela-Ascoli theorem.\nThis result applies to a variety of crack initiation models and in particular\napplies to a recent probabilistic model for LCF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 20:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 19:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

The data probe the emission from molecular PAH-type species,\ntransiently-heated Very Small Grains (VSGs), and large classical dust grains.\nWe compare the observations to earlier studies, especially those carried out\ntowards an isolated translucent cloud in Chamaeleon (Paper I). The spectra\ntowards the two LDN 1688 positions are very similar to each other, in spite of\nposition ON1 having a larger column density and probably being subjected to a\nstronger radiation field. The ratios of the mid-IR features are similar to\nthose found in other diffuse and translucent clouds. Compared to paper I, the\n7.7/11.3{\\mu}m band ratios are lower, ~2.0, at both LDN 1688 positions. A\ncontinuum is detected in the ~10{\\mu}m region.

Although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of\n10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, \"subgrid\" scales.\nGreat care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for the\neffect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. We investigate the momentum and\nenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and\nstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local star\nforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern\ncosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid\nmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds\nfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of young\nstar clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star\nforming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density\nmitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernova\nexplosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. The\ndetailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation\nand choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations\nin which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of global\nstar formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback\nimplementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermal\nfeedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formal\ngas cooling time. We find that simulations with maximal momentum injection\nsuppress star formation to a similar degree as is found in simulations adopting\nadiabatic thermal feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 21:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The general topological features shared with the\nzigzag flakes include the appearance of energy gaps at zero and low magnetic\nfields due to finite size, the formation of relativistic Landau levels at high\nmagnetic fields, and the presence between the Landau levels of edge states (the\nsocalled Halperin states) associated with the integer quantum Hall effect.\nTopological regimes, unique to the reczag nanoflakes, appear within a stripe of\nnegative energies E_b < E < 0, and along a separate feature forming a\nconstant-energy line outside this stripe.

Many of the\neffective-interaction theories in nuclear physics have been formulated by use\nof the so called $\\hatQ$ box introduced by Kuo et.al. It has been one of the\ncentral problems how to calculate the $\\hatQ$ box accurately and efficiently.\nWe first show that, introducing new basis states, the Hamiltonian is\ntransformed to a block-tridiagonal form in terms of submatrices with small\ndimension. With this transformed Hamiltonian, we next prove that the $\\hatQ$\nbox can be expressed in two ways: One is a form of continued fraction and the\nother is a simple series expansion up to second order with respect to\nrenormalized vertices and propagators. This procedure ensures to derive an\nexact $\\hatQ$ box, if the calculation converges as the dimension of the Hilbert\nspace tends to infinity. The $\\hatQ$ box given in this study corresponds to a\nnon-perturbative solution for the energy-dependent effective interaction which\nis often referred to as the Bloch-Horowitz or the Feshbach form.

While\nit opens exciting perspectives towards rich multimedia applications, it\nrequires the design of novel representations and coding techniques in order to\nsolve the new challenges imposed by interactive navigation. Interactivity\nclearly brings new design constraints: the encoder is unaware of the exact\ndecoding process, while the decoder has to reconstruct information from\nincomplete subsets of data since the server can generally not transmit images\nfor all possible viewpoints due to resource constrains. In this paper, we\npropose a novel multiview data representation that permits to satisfy bandwidth\nand storage constraints in an interactive multiview streaming system. In\nparticular, we partition the multiview navigation domain into segments, each of\nwhich is described by a reference image and some auxiliary information. The\nauxiliary information enables the client to recreate any viewpoint in the\nnavigation segment via view synthesis. The decoder is then able to navigate\nfreely in the segment without further data request to the server; it requests\nadditional data only when it moves to a different segment. We discuss the\nbenefits of this novel representation in interactive navigation systems and\nfurther propose a method to optimize the partitioning of the navigation domain\ninto independent segments, under bandwidth and storage constraints.\nExperimental results confirm the potential of the proposed representation;\nnamely, our system leads to similar compression performance as classical\ninter-view coding, while it provides the high level of flexibility that is\nrequired for interactive streaming. Hence, our new framework represents a\npromising solution for 3D data representation in novel interactive multimedia\nservices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 07:41:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 09:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

These flares are often, but not always,\ncorrelated. In a number of cases the peaks of optical flares are found to be\nsomewhat delayed with respect to the gamma-ray peaks. One notable example of\nsuch a delay was found in 3C 279 by Hayashida et al. and interpreted as a\nresult of steeper drop with distance of the energy density of external\nradiation field than of the magnetic energy density. In this paper we\ndemonstrate that in general, depending on the respective energy density profile\nalong the jet, such lags can have both signs and that they can take place for\nany ratio of these energy densities. We study the dependence of such lags on\nthe ratio of these energy densities at a distance of a maximal energy\ndissipation in a jet, on their gradients, as well as on the time profile of the\nrelativistic electron injection within the moving source. We show how prominent\nsuch lags can be, and what are their expected time scales. We suggest that\nstudies of such lags can provide a powerful tool to resolve the structure of\nrelativistic jets and their radiative environment.

It is related to well-known complexity measures like\nexcess entropy or statistical complexity. Essentially it is a variation of the\nexcess entropy so that it can be interpreted as a specific measure of system\ninternal memory. The PMI was first introduced in 2010 by Ball, Diakonova and\nMacKay as a measure for (strong) emergence. In this paper we define the PMI\nmathematically and investigate the relation to excess entropy and statistical\ncomplexity. In particular we prove that the excess entropy is an upper bound of\nthe PMI. Furthermore we show some properties of the PMI and calculate it\nexplicitly for some example processes. We also discuss to what extend it is a\nmeasure for emergence and compare it with alternative approaches used to\nformalize emergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 09:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

In this model, two phases appear, which interact via\na nonlocal Coulomb type energy. Here we focus on the sharp interface version of\nthis energy in the regime where one of the phases has very small volume\nfraction, thus creating small \"droplets\" of the minority phase in a \"sea\" of\nthe majority phase. In our previous paper, we computed the $\\Gamma$-limit of\nthe leading order energy, which yields the averaged behavior for almost\nminimizers, namely that the density of droplets should be uniform. Here we go\nto the next order and derive a next order $\\Gamma$-limit energy, which is\nexactly the Coulombian renormalized energy obtained by Sandier and Serfaty as a\nlimiting interaction energy for vortices in the magnetic Ginzburg-Landau model.\nThe derivation is based on the abstract scheme of Sandier-Serfaty that serves\nto obtain lower bounds for 2-scale energies and express them through some\nprobabilities on patterns via the multiparameter ergodic theorem. Without thus\nappealing to the Euler-Lagrange equation, we establish for all configurations\nwhich have \"almost minimal energy\" the asymptotic roundness and radius of the\ndroplets, and the fact that they asymptotically shrink to points whose\narrangement minimizes the renormalized energy in some averaged sense. Via a\nkind of $\\Gamma$-equivalence, the obtained results also yield an expansion of\nthe minimal energy for the original Ohta-Kawasaki energy. This leads to\nexpecting to see triangular lattices of droplets as energy minimizers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 11:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

One approach that emerged over a\ndecade ago and is still considered state-of-the-art is the Symbolic Aggregate\nApproximation algorithm. This discretization algorithm was the first symbolic\napproach that mapped a real-valued time series to a symbolic representation\nthat was guaranteed to lower-bound Euclidean distance. The interest of this\npaper concerns the SAX assumption of data being highly Gaussian and the use of\nthe standard normal curve to choose partitions to discretize the data. Though\nnot necessarily, but generally, and certainly in its canonical form, the SAX\napproach chooses partitions on the standard normal curve that would produce an\nequal probability for each symbol in a finite alphabet to occur. This procedure\nis generally valid as a time series is normalized before the rest of the SAX\nalgorithm is applied. However there exists a caveat to this assumption of\nequi-probability due to the intermediate step of Piecewise Aggregate\nApproximation (PAA). What we will show in this paper is that when PAA is\napplied the distribution of the data is indeed altered, resulting in a\nshrinking standard deviation that is proportional to the number of points used\nto create a segment of the PAA representation and the degree of\nauto-correlation within the series. Data that exhibits statistically\nsignificant auto-correlation is less affected by this shrinking distribution.\nAs the standard deviation of the data contracts, the mean remains the same,\nhowever the distribution is no longer standard normal and therefore the\npartitions based on the standard normal curve are no longer valid for the\nassumption of equal probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 13:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

Apart from\nproviding further evidence that Whittaker functions are the natural analogue of\nSchur polynomials in this setting, our results also provide a new\n`combinatorial' framework for the study of random polymers. When the input\nmatrix consists of random inverse gamma distributed weights, the probability\ndistribution of a polymer partition function constructed from these weights can\nbe written down explicitly in terms of Whittaker functions. Next we restrict\nthe geometric RSK mapping to symmetric matrices and show that the volume\npreserving property continues to hold. We determine the probability law of the\npolymer partition function with inverse gamma weights that are constrained to\nbe symmetric about the main diagonal, with an additional factor on the main\ndiagonal. The third combinatorial mapping studied is a variant of the geometric\nRSK mapping for triangular arrays, which is again showed to be volume\npreserving.

In general, LSBN first performs the partition by\nusing a second-order partition strategy, which achieves more robust results.\nLSBN conducts sampling and structure learning within each overlapping community\nafter the community is isolated from other variables by Markov Blanket. Finally\nLSBN employs an efficient algorithm, to merge structures of overlapping\ncommunities into a whole. In comparison with other four state-of-art\nlarge-scale network structure learning algorithms such as ARACNE, PC, Greedy\nSearch and MMHC, LSBN shows comparable results in five common benchmark\ndatasets, evaluated by precision, recall and f-score. What's more, LSBN makes\nit possible to learn large-scale Bayesian structure by Model Averaging which\nused to be intractable. In summary, LSBN provides an scalable and parallel\nframework for the reconstruction of network structures. Besides, the complete\ninformation of overlapping communities serves as the byproduct, which could be\nused to mine meaningful clusters in biological networks, such as\nprotein-protein-interaction network or gene regulatory network, as well as in\nsocial network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 14:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

A weak external bond between dimers is introduced\ninto the classical dimer model in this dimer film. We derived a general\nequation of melting temperature and applied it for computing the melting\ntemperature of a dimer film covering a finite square lattice. The melting\ntemperature is proportional to the external bonding energy that we assume it\nbinds neighboring dimers together and proportional to the inverse of entropy\nper site. Further more, it shows fusing two small rectangular dimer film with\nodd number of length into one big rectangular film gains more entropy than\nfusing two small rectangles with even number of length into the same big\nrectangle. Fusing two small toruses with even number of length into one big\ntorus reduces entropy. Fusing two small toruses with odd number of length\nincreases the entropy. Thus two dimer films with even number of length repel\neach other, two dimer films with odd length attract each other.

In\npractice, surface maps are usually represented and stored as 3D coordinates\neach vertex is mapped to, which often requires lots of storage memory. This\ncauses inconvenience in data transmission and data storage. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose an effective algorithm for compressing surface\nhomeomorphisms using Fourier approximation of the Beltrami representation. The\nBeltrami representation is a complex-valued function defined on triangular\nfaces of the surface mesh with supreme norm strictly less than 1. Under\nsuitable normalization, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of\nsurface homeomorphisms and the set of Beltrami representations. Hence, every\nbijective surface map is associated with a unique Beltrami representation.\nConversely, given a Beltrami representation, the corresponding bijective\nsurface map can be exactly reconstructed using the Linear Beltrami Solver\nintroduced in this paper. Using the Beltrami representation, the surface\nhomeomorphism can be easily compressed by Fourier approximation, without\ndistorting the bijectivity of the map. The storage memory can be effectively\nreduced, which is useful for many practical problems in computer graphics and\nimaging. In this paper, we proposed to apply the algorithm to texture map\ncompression and video compression. With our proposed algorithm, the storage\nrequirement for the texture properties of a textured surface can be\nsignificantly reduced. Our algorithm can further be applied to compressing\nmotion vector fields for video compression, which effectively improve the\ncompression ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 12:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-31"}
