A random ONB of the direct\nsum of the H_N is an independent sequence {U_N} of random ONB's of the H_N. We\nprove that if d_N tends to infinity and if the normalized traces of observables\nin H_N tend to a unique limit state, then a random ONB also tends to that limit\nstate. This generalizes an earlier result of the author for eigenspaces of the\nstandard 2-sphere, and shows that the result does not depend on how fast the\ndimensions grow. In particular it is valid for eigenspaces of a flat rational\ntorus in dimensions > 4.

This paper aims to provide signatures\nallowing identification of radiation from low-energy cosmic rays in X-ray\nspectra showing the 6.4 keV line. We study in detail the production of\nnonthermal line and continuum X-rays by interaction of accelerated electrons\nand ions with a neutral ambient gas. Corresponding models are then applied to\nXMM-Newton observations of the X-ray emission emanating from the Arches cluster\nregion near the Galactic center. Bright 6.4 keV line structures are observed\naround the Arches cluster. This emission is very likely produced by cosmic\nrays. We find that it can result from the bombardment of molecular gas by\nenergetic ions, but probably not by accelerated electrons. Using a model of\nX-ray production by cosmic-ray ions, we obtain a best-fit metallicity of the\nambient medium of 1.7 plus-minus 0.2 times the solar metallicity. A large flux\nof low-energy cosmic ray ions could be produced in the ongoing supersonic\ncollision between the star cluster and an adjacent molecular cloud.

In this work we consider cylindrical\nassemblies of chromophores that model structures produced by several\nsupramolecular techniques. Our study is especially guided by the versatile\nstructures produced by virus-templated assembly. We use a multi-objective\noptimization framework to determine design principles and limitations in light\nharvesting performance for such assemblies, both in the presence and absence of\ndisorder. We identify a fundamental trade-off in cylindrical assemblies that is\nencountered when attempting to maximize both efficiency of energy transfer and\nabsorption bandwidth. We also rationalize the optimal design strategies and\nprovide explanations for why various structures provide optimal performance.\nMost importantly, we find that the optimal design strategies depend on the\namount of energetic and structural disorder in the system.

This is\nfound in separable Gaussian environments, where distillable entanglement is\nable to survive the two-mode transmission, despite being broken in any\nsingle-mode transmission by the strong thermal noise. In the Gaussian setting,\nentanglement restoration is a threshold process, occurring only after a\ncritical amount of correlations has been injected.

The\njet is highly polarized, and surprisingly, the electric vector position angles\nin the jet are ``twisted'' with respect to the jet axis. Simple models of\nmagnetized jets are investigated in order to study various possible origins of\nthe electric vector distribution. In a cylindrically-symmetric transparent jet\na helical magnetic field will appear either transverse or longitudinal due to\npartial cancellations of Stokes parameters between the front and back of the\njet. Synchrotron opacity can break the symmetry, but it leads to fractional\npolarization less than that observed, and to strong frequency dependence that\nis not seen. Modeling shows that differential Doppler boosting in a diverging\njet can break the symmetry, allowing a helical magnetic field to produce a\ntwisted electric vector pattern. Constraints on the jet inclination, magnetic\nfield properties, intrinsic opening angle, and fluid velocities are obtained,\nand show that highly relativistic speeds ($\\beta \\ga 0.95$) are required.

We find the character of chemical\nbonding of Se on a flat nanoparticle facet to be ionic, similar to that\nobtained earlier for the Se/Ru(0001) surface, while in the case of a low\ncoordinated Ru configuration there is an indication of some covalent\ncontribution to the bonding leading to an increase in Se binding energy.

The Se modification of the Ru particles leads to weakening of\nthe oxygen bonding to the particle. However, overall, O binding energies are\nfound to be higher for the particles than for Se/Ru(0001).

The\nLyman-{\\alpha} emission represents only a minor part of the total radiated\nenergy of this flare, for which a white-light continuum was detected.\nAdditionally, we found that the Lyman-{\\alpha} flare profile follows the\ngradual phase but peaks before other wavelengths. This M2 flare was very\nlocalized and has a very brief impulsive phase, but more statistics are needed\nto determine if these factors influence the presence of a Lyman-{\\alpha} flare\nsignal strong enough to appear in the solar irradiance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 07:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Nonlinear numerical simulations in the slender-body\nlimit, based on an explicit description of the coupling between the fluid-solid\nand electric systems, are used to determine the harvesting efficiency of the\nsystem, namely the fraction of the flow kinetic energy flux effectively used to\npower the output circuit, and its evolution with the system's parameters. The\nrole of the tuning between the characteristic frequencies of the fluid-solid\nand electric systems is emphasized, as well as the critical impact of the\npiezoelectric coupling intensity. High fluid loading, classically associated\nwith destabilization by damping, leads to greater energy harvesting, but with a\nweaker robustness to flow velocity fluctuations due to the sensitivity of the\nflapping mode selection. This suggests that a control of this mode selection by\na careful design of the output circuit could provide some opportunities of\nimprovement for the efficiency and robustness of the energy harvesting process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 07:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-11"}

Despite the broad applicability, it is notoriously difficult\nto be understood theoretically because of the absence of a small interaction\nparameter. Recent achievements of ultracold trapped Fermi atoms near a Feshbach\nresonance have ushered in enormous changes. The unprecedented control of\ninteraction, geometry and purity in these novel systems has led to many\nexciting experimental results, which are to be urgently understood at both low\nand finite temperatures. Here we review the latest developments of virial\nexpansion for a strongly correlated Fermi gas and their applications on\nultracold trapped Fermi atoms. We show remarkable, quantitative agreements\nbetween virial predictions and various recent experimental measurements at\nabout the Fermi degenerate temperature. For equation of state, we discuss a\npractical way of determining high-order virial coefficients and use it to\ncalculate accurately the long-sought third-order virial coefficient, which is\nnow verified firmly in experiments at ENS and MIT.

The main result is that the ChME is not\nrenormalized: in the hydrodynamic approximation it remains the same as for\nnon-interacting chiral fermions moving in an external magnetic field. The key\ningredients in the proof are general laws of thermodynamics and the\nAdler-Bardeen theorem for the chiral anomaly in external electromagnetic\nfields. The chiral magnetic effect in hydrodynamics represents a macroscopic\nmanifestation of a quantum phenomenon (chiral anomaly). Moreover, one can argue\nthat the current induced by the magnetic field is dissipation free and talk\nabout a kind of \"chiral superconductivity\". More precise description is a\nballistic transport along magnetic field taking place in equilibrium and in\nabsence of a driving force. The basic limitation is exact chiral limit while\nthe temperature--excitingly enough- does not seemingly matter. What is still\nlacking, is a detailed quantum microscopic picture for the ChME in\nhydrodynamics. Probably, the chiral currents propagate through\nlower-dimensional defects, like vortices in superfluid.

In\nparticular, the nesting features of the Fermi surfaces yield maximum of the\nstatic magnetic susceptibility at the incommensurate wave vector q_{max}\nbelonging the direction q_X-q_W (q_X=(2\\pi/a)(1,0,0),q_W=(2\\pi/a)(1,1/2,0), a\nis a lattice parameter) in agreement with the experimental data. This state is\nfound however to compete closely with the states characterized by magnetic wave\nvectors along the directions q_X-q_L-q_K, where q_L=(2\\pi/a)(1/2,1/2,1/2),\nq_K=(2\\pi/a)(3/4,3/4,0). From the analysis of the uniform magnetic\nsusceptibility we find that contrary to \\alpha-iron, the Curie-Weiss law is not\nfulfilled in a broad temperature range, although the inverse susceptibility is\nnearly linear in the moderate-temperature region (1200-1500 K). The\nnon-linearity of the inverse uniform magnetic susceptibility in a broader\ntemperature range is due to the density of states peak located close to the\nFermi level. The effective exchange integrals in the paramagnetic phase are\nestimated on the base of momentum dependent susceptibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 09:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2013 08:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-29"}

We consider two\ndifferent galaxy surveys: a spectroscopic redshift survey and a cosmic shear\nsurvey. We make use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) technique and\nassume two sets of theoretical errors. The first error is meant to account for\nuncertainties in the modelling of the effect of neutrinos on the non-linear\ngalaxy power spectrum and we assume this error to be fully correlated in\nFourier space. The second error is meant to parametrize the overall residual\nuncertainties in modelling the non-linear galaxy power spectrum at small\nscales, and is conservatively assumed to be uncorrelated and to increase with\nthe ratio of a given scale to the scale of non-linearity. It hence increases\nwith wavenumber and decreases with redshift. With these two assumptions for the\nerrors and assuming further conservatively that the uncorrelated error rises\nabove 2% at k = 0.4 h/Mpc and z = 0.5, we find that a future Euclid-like cosmic\nshear/galaxy survey achieves a 1-sigma error on Mnu close to 32 meV/25 meV,\nsufficient for detecting the total neutrino mass with good significance. If the\nresidual uncorrelated errors indeed rises rapidly towards smaller scales in the\nnon-linear regime as we have assumed here then the data on non-linear scales\ndoes not increase the sensitivity to the total neutrino mass. Assuming instead\na ten times smaller theoretical error with the same scale dependence, the error\non the total neutrino mass decreases moderately from sigma(Mnu) = 18 meV to 14\nmeV when mildly non-linear scales with 0.1 h/Mpc < k < 0.6 h/Mpc are included\nin the analysis of the galaxy survey data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 09:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

It is shown that the observed glitch\nsize distributions cannot be reproduced if superfluid vortices unpin\nindependently via a Poisson process; the central limit theorem yields a narrow\nGaussian for the size distribution, instead of the broad, power-law tail\nobserved. This conclusion is not altered fundamentally when a range of pinning\npotentials is included, which leads to excavation of the potential distribution\nof occupied sites, vortex accumulation at strong pinning sites, and hence the\noccasional, abnormally large glitch. Knock-on processes are therefore needed to\nmake the unpinning rate of a vortex conditional on the pinning state of its\nnear and/or remote neighbours, so that the Gaussian size distributions\nresulting generically from the central limit theorem are avoided. At least two\nknock-on processes, nearest- neighbour proximity knock-on and remote acoustic\nknock-on, are clearly evident in the Gross-Pitaevskii simulation output.

While there are several outliers to the\nradio--X-ray correlation of the hard state of low-mass X-ray binaries, XTE\nJ1650-500 is the first example of an outlier to the NIR/optical--X-ray\ncorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 09:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

After studying his major optical\nmanuscript, titled Manazir wa Maraya, it was found very interesting that the\nmajority of al-Qayini's propositions relating to natural phenomena were not\nmerely geometrical definitions, but that the proofs related to astronomy. As an\nexample, in one case, which had not been explained in previous astronomical and\noptical manuscripts, al-Qayini tried, despite lacking a vigorous proof, to show\nhow a special point in a room could be lit up by sunlight throughout the year.\nHis particular interest in astronomy led us to a general study of his other\nworks, and it is worth noting that out of the nineteen works that have been\nattributed to him, eleven are devoted to astronomy and have not been thoroughly\nstudied. Much more research is required on his astronomical manuscripts in\norder to obtain a better understanding of this author, the century in which he\nlived and the general state of science in the late Islamic period.

The secular change in the rotation period caused\nby the YORP effect can be detected by analysis of asteroid photometric\nlightcurves. We analyzed photometric lightcurves of near-Earth asteroids (1865)\nCerberus, (2100) Ra-Shalom, and (3103) Eger with the aim to detect possible\ndeviations from the constant rotation caused by the YORP effect. We carried out\nnew photometric observations of the three asteroids, combined the new\nlightcurves with archived data, and used the lightcurve inversion method to\nmodel the asteroid shape, pole direction, and rotation rate. The YORP effect\nwas modeled as a linear change in the rotation rate in time d\\omega /dt. Values\nof d\\omega/ dt derived from observations were compared with the values\npredicted by theory. We derived physical models for all three asteroids. We had\nto model Eger as a nonconvex body because the convex model failed to fit the\nlightcurves observed at high phase angles. We probably detected the\nacceleration of the rotation rate of Eger d\\omega / dt = (1.4 +/- 0.6) x\n10^{-8} rad/d (3\\sigma error), which corresponds to a decrease in the rotation\nperiod by 4.2 ms/yr.

The DoF-formula we obtain lower-bounds the DoF\nof all channels--with respect to the choice of the channel matrix--and\nupper-bounds the DoF of almost all channels. It applies to a large class of\nnoise distributions, and its proof is based on an extension of a result by\nGuionnet and Shlyakthenko [3] to the vector case in combination with the Ruzsa\ntriangle inequality for differential entropy introduced by Kontoyiannis and\nMadiman [4]. As in scalar ICs, achieving full DoF requires the use of singular\ninput distributions. Strikingly, in the vector case it suffices to enforce\nsingularity on the joint distribution of each individual transmit vector. This\ncan be realized through signaling in subspaces of the ambient signal space,\nwhich is in accordance with the idea of interference alignment, and, most\nimportantly, allows the scalar entries of the transmit vectors to have\nnon-singular distributions. The DoF-formula for vector ICs we obtain enables a\nunified treatment of \"classical\" interference alignment a la Cadambe and Jafar\n[5], and Maddah-Ali et al.

In this paper we look at\nembeddings into four-dimensional cubes instead, and determine the function\nc_{EC}(a) whose value at a is the infimum of the size of a 4-cube C^{4}(A) =\nD^{2}(A) times D^{2}(A) into which the ellipsoid E(1,a) symplectically embeds\n(where D^{2}(A) denotes the disc in mathbb{R}^{2} of area A). As in the case of\nembeddings into balls, the structure of the graph of c_{EC}(a) is very rich:\nfor a less than the square sigma^2 of the silver ratio sigma := 1+sqrt(2), the\nfunction c_{EC}(a) turns out to be piecewise linear, with an infinite staircase\nconverging to (sigma^2, sqrt(sigma^2/2)). This staircase is determined by Pell\nnumbers.

When multi-threading is combined with tabling, we can exploit the\npower of higher procedural control and declarative semantics. However, despite\nthe availability of both threads and tabling in some Prolog systems, the\nimplementation of these two features implies complex ties to each other and to\nthe underlying engine. Until now, XSB was the only Prolog system combining\nmulti-threading with tabling. In XSB, tables may be either private or shared\nbetween threads. While thread-private tables are easier to implement, shared\ntables have all the associated issues of locking, synchronization and potential\ndeadlocks. In this paper, we propose an alternative view to XSB's approach. In\nour proposal, each thread views its tables as private but, at the engine level,\nwe use a common table space where tables are shared among all threads. We\npresent three designs for our common table space approach: No-Sharing (NS)\n(similar to XSB's private tables), Subgoal-Sharing (SS) and Full-Sharing (FS).\nThe primary goal of this work was to reduce the memory usage for the table\nspace but, our experimental results, using the YapTab tabling system with a\nlocal evaluation strategy, show that we can also achieve significant reductions\non running time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 14:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 22:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-11"}

As a result from our work, IRAS 19520+2759, with a\ncontroversial nature in the past, is firmly established as a massive young\nstellar object associated with a strong and compact millimetre source and\ndriving a collimated outflow. In addition, a second fainter millimetre source\nis discovered about 4 arcsec to the south, which is also driving an outflow.\nFurthermore, the two millimetre sources are associated with C18O clumps\nelongated perpendicularly to the outflows, which may be related to rotating\ntoroids. The masses of gas and dust of the millimetre sources are estimated to\nbe around 100 and 50 Msun. MM1, the dominant source at all wavelengths, with a\ntotal luminosity of (1-2)x10^5 Lsun at 9 kpc, is however not associated with 6\ncm emission down to a rms noise level of 0.1 mJy.

The\nformation and early evolution of binaries is a longstanding problem in star\nformation that is not fully understood. In particular, how the magnetic field\nobserved in star-forming cores shapes the binary characteristics remains\nrelatively unexplored. We demonstrate numerically, using the ENZO-MHD code,\nthat a magnetic field of the observed strength can drastically change two of\nthe basic quantities of a binary system: the orbital separation and mass ratio\nof the two components. Our calculations focus on the protostellar mass\naccretion phase, after a pair of stellar 'seeds' have already formed. We find\nthat, in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level, the angular momentum of\nthe gas accreted by the protobinary is greatly reduced by magnetic braking.\nAccretion of strongly braked material shrinks the protobinary separation by a\nlarge factor compared to the non-magnetic case. The magnetic braking also\nchanges the evolution of the mass ratio of unequal-mass protobinaries by\nproducing gas of low specific angular momentum that accretes preferentially\nonto the primary rather than the secondary. This is in contrast with the\npreferential mass accretion onto the secondary previously found for\nprotobinaries accreting from an unmagnetized envelope, which tends to drive the\nmass ratio towards unity. In addition, the magnetic field greatly modifies the\nmorphology and dynamics of the protobinary accretion flow. It suppresses the\ncircumstellar and circumbinary disks that feed the protobinary in the\nnon-magnetic case; the binary is fed instead by a fast collapsing pseudodisk\nwhose rotation is strongly braked.

Disjunctive Datalog is useful in a wide range of applications,\nranging from Databases (e.g., Data Integration) to Artificial Intelligence\n(e.g., diagnosis and planning under incomplete knowledge). However, in recent\nyears an important shortcoming of Datalog-based languages became evident, e.g.\nin the context of data-integration (consistent query-answering, ontology-based\ndata access) and Semantic Web applications: The language does not permit any\ngeneration of and reasoning with unnamed individuals in an obvious way. In\ngeneral, it is weak in supporting many cases of existential quantification. To\novercome this problem, Datalogex has recently been proposed, which extends\ntraditional Datalog by existential quantification in rule heads. In this work,\nwe propose a natural extension of Disjunctive Datalog and Datalogex, called\nDatalogexor, which allows both disjunctions and existential quantification in\nrule heads and is therefore an attractive language for knowledge representation\nand reasoning, especially in domains where ontology-based reasoning is needed.\nWe formally define syntax and semantics of the language Datalogexor, and\nprovide a notion of instantiation, which we prove to be adequate for\nDatalogexor. A main issue of Datalogex and hence also of Datalogexor is that\ndecidability is no longer guaranteed for typical reasoning tasks.

To prove it\nfor the family {a(tn^2)}_n where t is a squarefree number and n runs through\nall natural numbers, we assume the existence of a suitable error term for the\nconvergence of the Sato-Tate distribution, which is weaker than one conjectured\nby Akiyama and Tanigawa. In this case, the results are in terms of\nDedekind-Dirichlet density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 15:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 14:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 06:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

As expected from previous studies, the Mott\ninsulator phase is considerably more stable against the superfluid phase when\nfilling with an even number of bosons than when filling with an odd number of\nbosons. The phase-boundary curves are consistent with the perturbative\nmean-field theory in the limit of infinite dimensions. The critical value of\nthe hopping parameter $t_{\\rm C}$ at the peak of the Mott lobe depends on the\nantiferromagnetic interaction. This result indicates the reliability of the\nstrong coupling expansion when $U_2$ possesses large (intermediate) values for\nMott lobe with an even (odd) number of bosons. Moreover, in order to improve\nour results, we apply a few extrapolation methods up to infinite order in $t$.\nThe fitting results of the phase-boundary curves agree better with those of the\nperturbative mean-field approximation.

The main distinguishing\nfeature of the present V\\\"axj\\\"o interpretation is the combination of realism\non the subquantum level with nonobjectivity of quantum observables (i.e.,\nimpossibility to assign their values before measurements). Hence, realism is\ndestroyed by detectors transforming continuous subquantum reality into discrete\nevents, clicks of detectors. The V\\\"axj\\\"o interpretation-2012 is fundamentally\ncontextual in the sense that the value of an observable depends on measurement\ncontext. This is contextuality in Bohr's sense.
