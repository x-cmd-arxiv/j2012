While increasing\nthe cell level is easy, reducing the level of a cell can be accomplished only\nby erasing an entire block. Since block erasures are highly undesirable, coding\nschemes - known as floating codes (or flash codes) and buffer codes - have been\ndesigned in order to maximize the number of times that information stored in a\nflash memory can be written (and re-written) prior to incurring a block\nerasure.\n  An (n,k,t)q flash code C is a coding scheme for storing k information bits in\n$n$ cells in such a way that any sequence of up to t writes can be accommodated\nwithout a block erasure. The total number of available level transitions in n\ncells is n(q-1), and the write deficiency of C, defined as \\delta(C) =\nn(q-1)-t, is a measure of how close the code comes to perfectly utilizing all\nthese transitions.

In such systems, a\ngroup of sensing nodes periodically collect measurements about the signals\nbeing observed in the given geographical region and transmit these measurements\nto a central node, which in turn processes this information to recover the\nsignals. For example, in cognitive radio networks, the signals of interest are\nthose generated by the primary transmitters and the sensing nodes are the\nsecondary users. In such networks, it is critically important to be able to\nreliably determine the presence or absence of primary transmitters in order to\navoid causing interference. The standard approach to transmit these\nmeasurements from sensor the nodes to the fusion center has been to use\northogonal channels. Such an approach quickly places a burden on the\ncontrol-channel-capacity of the network that would scale linearly in the number\nof cooperating sensing nodes. In this paper, we show that as long as one\ncondition is satisfied: the dynamics of the observed signals are sparse, i.e.,\nthe observed signals do not change their values very rapidly in relation to the\ntime-scale at which the measurements are collected, we can significantly reduce\nthe control bandwidth of the system while achieving the full (linear) bandwidth\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 01:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The results of the memory\nfunction suggest that the non-thermal fluctuations can be divided into Markov\nand non-Markov contributions, the latter is called the turbulent fluctuation\n(TF). Consequently, the relaxation dynamics is separated into three\ncharacteristic stages: bare-friction, early, and late stages. If the\ndissipation due to TFs dominates over that of the Markov contribution, the\nbare-friction stage contracts; the early and late stages then configure the\ndual structure. The memory effect due to TFs results in the time-reversible\nrelaxation at the early stage, and the disappearance of the memory by turbulent\nmixing leads to a simple exponential relaxation at the late stage.

Both the optical and\nX-ray light curves of 2007 outburst show multi-peak features.\nQuasi-simultaneous optical/X-ray luminosity shows that both the X-ray\nreprocessing and viscously thermal emission can explain the observed optical\nflux. There is a slightly X-ray delay of 0.6+-0.3 days during the first peak,\nwhile the X-ray emission lags the optical emission by ~2 days during the\nrebrightening stage, which suggests that X-ray reprocessing emission\ncontributes significantly to the optical flux in the first peak, but the\nviscously-heated-disk origin dominates the optical flux during rebrightening.\nIt implies variation of the physical environment of the outer disk, even the\nsource stayed in low-hard state during the whole outburst. The ~2 day X-ray lag\nindicates a small accretion disk of the system, and the optical counterpart was\nnot detected by OGLE and MOA during quiescence, which constrained it to be\nfainter than MI = 7.5 mag.

Motivated by\nthese observations, we examine the dynamical regime of the circulation in the\natmospheres and interiors of these objects. Brown dwarfs rotate rapidly, and\nfor plausible wind speeds, the flow at large scales will be rotationally\ndominated. We present 3D, global, numerical simulations of convection in the\ninterior, which demonstrate that, at large scales, the convection aligns in the\ndirection parallel to the rotation axis. Convection occurs more efficiently at\nhigh latitudes than low latitudes, leading to systematic equator-to-pole\ntemperature differences that may reach ~1 K near the top of the convection\nzone. The interaction of convection with the overlying, stably stratified\natmosphere will generate a wealth of atmospheric waves, and we argue that, as\nin the stratospheres of planets in the solar system, the interaction of these\nwaves with the mean flow will cause a significant atmospheric circulation at\nregional to global scales. At large scales, this should consist of stratified\nturbulence (possibly organizing into coherent structures such as vortices and\njets) and an accompanying overturning circulation. We present an approximate\nanalytic theory of this circulation, which predicts characteristic horizontal\ntemperature variations of several to ~50 K, horizontal wind speeds of ~10-300\nm/sec, and vertical velocities that advect air over a scale height in\n~10^5-10^6 sec. This vertical mixing may help to explain the chemical\ndisequilibrium observed on some brown dwarfs. Moreover, the implied large-scale\norganization of temperature perturbations and vertical velocities suggests\nthat, near the L/T transition, patchy clouds can form near the photosphere,\nhelping to explain recent observations of brown-dwarf variability in the\nnear-IR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 06:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 18:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A widely used strategy in this context\nis to compare samples from several populations, and to look for genomic regions\nwith outstanding genetic differentiation between these populations. Genetic\ndifferentiation is generally based on allele frequency differences between\npopulations, which are measured by Fst or related statistics. Here we introduce\na new statistic, denoted hapFLK, which focuses instead on the differences of\nhaplotype frequencies between populations. In contrast to most existing\nstatistics, hapFLK accounts for the hierarchical structure of the sampled\npopulations. Using computer simulations, we show that each of these two\nfeatures - the use of haplotype information and of the hierarchical structure\nof populations - significantly improves the detection power of selected loci,\nand that combining them in the hapFLK statistic provides even greater power. We\nalso show that hapFLK is robust with respect to bottlenecks and migration and\nimproves over existing approaches in many situations. Finally, we apply hapFLK\nto a set of six sheep breeds from Northern Europe, and identify seven regions\nunder selection, which include already reported regions but also several new\nones.

It is revealed that dark matter\nhaloes of ~10^4M_sun can produce first luminous objects with the aid of dark\nmatter cusps. Therefore, the mass of first objects is smaller by roughly two\norders of magnitude than in the previous prediction. This implies that the\nnumber of Pop III stars formed in the early universe could be significantly\nlarger than hitherto thought. Secondly, the feedback by photo-ionization and\nphoto-dissociation photons in the first objects is explored with radiation\nhydrodynamic simulations, and it is demonstrated that multiple stars can form\nin a 10^5M_sun halo. Thirdly, the fragmentation of an accretion disk around a\nprimordial protostar is explored with photo-dissociation feedback. As a result,\nit is found that the photo-dissociation can reduce the mass accretion rate onto\nprotostars. Also, protostars as small as 0.8M_sun may be ejected and evolve\nwith keeping their mass, which might be detected as \"real first stars\" in the\nGalactic halo. Finally, state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamic simulations are\nperformed to investigate the internal ionization of first galaxies and the\nescape of ionizing photons.

In\nMaker-Breaker games there are two players, denoted by Maker and Breaker. In\neach round, Maker claims one previously unclaimed edge of $G$ and Breaker\nresponds by claiming $b$ previously unclaimed edges. We consider the\nHamiltonicity game, the perfect matching game and the $k$-vertex-connectivity\ngame, where Maker's goal is to build a graph which possesses the relevant\nproperty. Avoider-Enforcer games are the reverse analogue of Maker-Breaker\ngames with a slight modification, where the two players claim at least 1 and at\nleast $b$ previously unclaimed edges per move, respectively, and Avoider aims\nto avoid building a graph which possesses the relevant property.\n  Maker-Breaker games are known to be \"bias-monotone\", that is, if Maker wins\nthe $(1,b)$ game, he also wins the $(1,b-1)$ game. Therefore, it makes sense to\ndefine the critical bias of a game, $b^*$, to be the \"breaking point\" of the\ngame. That is, Maker wins the $(1,b)$ game whenever $b\\leq b^*$ and loses\notherwise. An analogous definition of the critical bias exists for\nAvoider-Enforcer games: here, the critical bias of a game $b^*$ is such that\nAvoider wins the $(1,b)$ game for every $b > b^*$, and loses otherwise.\n  We prove that, for every $p=\\omega(\\frac{\\ln n}{n})$, $G\\sim\\gnp$ is\ntypically such that the critical bias for all the aforementioned Maker-Breaker\ngames is asymptotically $b^*=\\frac{np}{\\ln n}$.

We\nprepare four different initial clouds having different magnetic field strengths\nand rotation rates, in which magnetic field lines are aligned/misaligned with\nthe rotation axis. First, we calculate the evolution of such clouds from the\nprestellar stage until long after protostar formation. Then, we calculate the\npolarization of thermal dust emission expected from the simulation data. We\ncreate polarization maps with arbitrary viewing angles and compare them with\nobservations. Using this procedure, we confirmed that the polarization\ndistribution projected on the celestial plane strongly depends on the viewing\nangle of the cloud. Thus, by comparing the observations with the polarization\nmap predicted by the simulations, we can roughly determine the angle between\nthe direction of the global magnetic field and the line of sight. The\nconfiguration of the polarization vectors also depends on the viewing angle. We\nfind that an hourglass configuration of magnetic field lines is not always\nrealized in a collapsing cloud when the global magnetic field is misaligned\nwith the cloud rotation axis. Depending on the viewing angle, an S-shaped\nconfiguration of the magnetic field (or the polarization vectors) appears early\nin the protostellar accretion phase. This indicates that not only the magnetic\nfield but also the cloud rotation affects the dynamical evolution of such a\ncloud.

With flux input derived from the observed\nrecord of sunspot groups, the simulations cover the period between 1874 and\n1980 (corresponding to solar cycles 11 to 20).

At small radii the extreme radiation\nenvironment and strong space constraints are addressed with very thin pixel\nsensors active thickness in the range of (75-150) mum, and the development of\nslim as well as active edges.

Taking Abell 1689 as an\nexample, its dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocity\ndispersions larger than 500 km/s, mainly produce large time delays, while\ngalaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller time delays. We\nestimate the probability of observing multiple images of a supernova in the\nknown images of Abell 1689. A two-component model of estimating the supernova\nrate is applied in this work.

If the magnitude threshold is\nlowered to m_AB ~ 27.0, the rate of core-collapse supernovae suitable for time\ndelay observation is 0.044 +- 0.015 per year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 14:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-07"}

Often times, the problems in the\nsequence are linked in a way that allows intermediate results to be reused. A\ncharacteristic example for this class of applications is given by the\nGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), a widely spread tool in computational\nbiology. GWAS entails the solution of up to trillions ($10^{12}$) of correlated\ngeneralized least-squares problems, posing a daunting challenge: the\nperformance of petaflops ($10^{15}$ floating-point operations) over terabytes\nof data.\n  In this paper, we design an algorithm for performing GWAS on multi-core\narchitectures. This is accomplished in three steps. First, we show how to\nexploit the relation among successive problems, thus reducing the overall\ncomputational complexity. Then, through an analysis of the required data\ntransfers, we identify how to eliminate any overhead due to input/output\noperations. Finally, we study how to decompose computation into tasks to be\ndistributed among the available cores, to attain high performance and\nscalability. With our algorithm, a GWAS that currently requires the use of a\nsupercomputer may now be performed in matter of hours on a single multi-core\nnode.\n  The discussion centers around the methodology to develop the algorithm rather\nthan the specific application. We believe the paper contributes valuable\nguidelines of general applicability for computational scientists on how to\ndevelop and optimize numerical algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 14:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-01"}

This results in a complex environment that is ideal for\nstudying the latter stages of stellar evolution along with interactions within\nbinary systems. As a star approaches the end of its life, in particular the red\ngiant phase, it exhausts its supply of core hydrogen and begins burning its way\nthrough successively heavier elements. Red giants lose mass in the form of a\ndense wind that will replenish the interstellar medium with chemical elements\nthat are formed through nuclear processes deep in the stellar interior. When\nthese elements reach the interstellar medium they play a central role in both\nstellar and planetary evolution, as well as providing the essential\nconstituents needed for life. The undoubted significance of these cool giants\nmeans the study of their atmospheres is necessary to help understand our place\nin the Universe. This thesis presents Hubble Space Telescope observations of\nthe symbiotic system EG Andromedae as an insight into red giant stars. EG And\nis one of the brightest and closest symbiotic systems and consists of a red\ngiant primary along with a white dwarf.

Among the\ndocuments he gathered to support his thesis was the personal account of a\nsailor by the name of Gustaf Johansen, describing an encounter with an\nextraordinary island. Johansen`s descriptions of his adventures upon the island\nare fantastic, and are often considered the most enigmatic (and therefore the\nhighlight) of Thurston`s collection of documents.\n  We contend that all of the credible phenomena which Johansen described may be\nexplained as being the observable consequences of a localized bubble of\nspacetime curvature. Many of his most incomprehensible statements (involving\nthe geometry of the architecture, and variability of the location of the\nhorizon) can therefore be said to have a unified underlying cause.\n  We propose a simplified example of such a geometry, and show using numerical\ncomputation that Johansen`s descriptions were, for the most part, not simply\nthe ravings of a lunatic. Rather, they are the nontechnical observations of an\nintelligent man who did not understand how to describe what he was seeing.\nConversely, it seems to us improbable that Johansen should have unwittingly\ngiven such a precise description of the consequences of spacetime curvature, if\nthe details of this story were merely the dregs of some half remembered fever\ndream.\n  We calculate the type of matter which would be required to generate such\nexotic spacetime curvature. Unfortunately, we determine that the required\nmatter is quite unphysical, and possess a nature which is entirely alien to all\nof the experiences of human science. Indeed, any civilization with mastery over\nsuch matter would be able to construct warp drives, cloaking devices, and other\nexotic geometries required to conveniently travel through the cosmos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 13:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-06"}
