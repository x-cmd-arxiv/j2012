This large sample of objects offers an unique opportunity to\ntest conditions of fullerene formation and survival under different metallicity\nenvironments as we are analyzing five sources in our own Galaxy, four in the\nLMC, and seven in the SMC. Among the 16 PNe under study, we present the first\ndetection of C60 (possibly also C70) fullerenes in the PN M 1-60 as well as of\nthe unusual 6.6, 9.8, and 20 um features (possible planar C24) in the PN K\n3-54. Although selection effects in the original samples of PNe observed with\nSpitzer may play a potentially significant role in the statistics, we find that\nthe detection rate of fullerenes in C-rich PNe increases with decreasing\nmetallicity (5% in the Galaxy, 20% in the LMC, and 44% in the SMC). CLOUDY\nphotoionization modeling matches the observed IR fluxes with central stars that\ndisplay a rather narrow range in effective temperature (30,000-45,000 K),\nsuggesting a common evolutionary status of the objects and similar fullerene\nformation conditions. The observed C60 intensity ratios in the Galactic sources\nconfirm our previous finding in the MCs that the fullerene emission is not\nexcited by the UV radiation from the central star. CLOUDY models also show that\nline- and wind-blanketed model atmospheres can explain many of the observed\n[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios by photoionization suggesting that possibly the UV\nradiation from the central star, and not shocks, are triggering the\ndecomposition of the circumstellar dust grains. With the data at hand, we\nsuggest that the most likely explanation for the formation of fullerenes and\ngraphene precursors in PNe is that these molecular species are built from the\nphoto-chemical processing of a carbonaceous compound with a mixture of aromatic\nand aliphatic structures similar to that of HAC dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2012 16:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2012 19:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Nov 2012 10:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

However, our observations do show that all of\nthe very brightest sources in the LESS sample, S(870um)>12mJy, comprise\nemission from multiple, fainter SMGs, each with 870-um fluxes of <9mJy. This\nimplies a natural limit to the star-formation rate in SMGs of <10^3 M_Sun/yr,\nwhich in turn suggests that the space densities of z>1 galaxies with gas masses\nin excess of ~5x10^10 M_Sun is <10^-5 Mpc^-3. We also discuss the influence of\nthis blending on the identification and characterisation of the SMG\ncounterparts to these bright submillimetre sources and suggest that it may be\nresponsible for previous claims that they lie at higher redshifts than fainter\nSMGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2012 22:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 21:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

This leads to\ndestructive interference between modes which explain strong suppression of\nsteady state transmission and of pulsed transmission at early times. We have\nalso studied the statistics of mode spacings and widths in localized samples.\nThe distribution of mode spacings between adjacent modes is close to the Wigner\nsurmise predicted for diffusive waves, which exhibit strong level repulsion.\nHowever, a deviation from Wigner distribution can be seen in the distribution\nof spacings beyond the nearest ones. A weakening in the rigidity of the modal\nspectrum is also observed as the sample length increases because of reduced\nlevel repulsion for more strongly localized waves. In contrast to residual\ndiffusive behavior for level spacing statistics, the distribution of level\nwidths are log-normal as predicted for localized waves. We also measured the\nsteady state and dynamic fluctuations and correlation of localized wave\ntransmitted through random waveguides. We find the degree of intensity\ncorrelation first increases, and then decays with time delay, before increasing\ndramatically. The variation in the spatial correlation of intensity with time\ndelay is due to the changing effective number of modes that contribute to\ntransmission. A minimum in correlation is reached when the number of modes\ncontributing appreciably to transmission peaks. At long times, the degree of\nintensity correlation and the variance of total transmission increase\ndramatically.

By observing the frequency dependent interference pattern, it is\npossible to reconstruct the amplitudes and the phases of the two-photon\nwavefunction within the bandwidth of the reference pulses used in the single\nphoton interferences.

Motivated by analyzing a\nrepeated cell adhesion experiment, a new class of nonlinear time series models\nwith an order selection procedure is developed in this paper. Due to the\nnonlinearity, there are two types of overfitting. Therefore, a double penalized\napproach is introduced for order selection. To implement this approach, a\nglobal optimization algorithm using mixed integer programming is discussed. The\nprocedure is shown to be asymptotically consistent in estimating both the order\nand parameters of the proposed model. Simulations show that the new order\nselection approach outperforms standard methods. The finite-sample performance\nof the estimator is also examined via a simulation study. The application of\nthe proposed methodology to a T-cell experiment provides a better understanding\nof the kinetics and mechanics of cell adhesion, including quantifying the\nmemory effect on a repeated unbinding force experiment and identifying the\norder of the memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 08:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-02"}

In this paper, we introduce a fast segmentation method based\non a new variant of spectral graph theory named diffusion maps.

The presented approach does not require edge-based image\ninformation and relies on regional image texture. Consequently, the proposed\nmethod demonstrates robustness in situations of low image contrast or poor\nlayer-to-layer image gradients. Diffusion mapping is applied to 2D and 3D OCT\ndatasets composed of two steps, one for partitioning the data into important\nand less important sections, and another one for localization of internal\nlayers.In the first step, the pixels/voxels are grouped in rectangular/cubic\nsets to form a graph node.The weights of a graph are calculated based on\ngeometric distances between pixels/voxels and differences of their mean\nintensity.The first diffusion map clusters the data into three parts, the\nsecond of which is the area of interest.

No magnetic ordering down to 50 mK in Cp(T) and the unusual temperature\nand field scaling of the bulk and NMR data are associated with a magnetic\ninstability which drives the system to quantum criticality. The magnetic\nproperties of the system are tuned by field wherein ferromagnetic fluctuations\nare suppressed and a crossover from quantum critical to FL behavior is observed\nwith increasing magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 09:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The\nfundamental relations involving metallicity, such as the mass-metallicity\nrelation (MZR) or the fundamental-metallicity relation, give controversial\nresults about the reality of evolution of the chemical content of galaxies at a\ngiven stellar mass. In this work we shed some light on this issue using the\ncompleteness reached by the 20k bright sample of the zCOSMOS survey and using\nfor the first time the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio (N/O) as a tracer of the gas\nphase chemical evolution of galaxies that is independent of the star formation\nrate. Emission-line galaxies both in the SDSS and 20k zCOSMOS bright survey\nwere used to study the evolution from the local Universe of the $MZR up to a\nredshift of 1.32 and the relation between stellar mass and nitrogen-to-oxygen\nratio (MNOR) up to a redshift of 0.42 using the N2S2 parameter. All the\nphysical properties derived from stellar continuum and gas emission-lines,\nincluding stellar mass, star formation rates, metallicity and N/O, were\ncalculated in a self-consistent way over the full redshift range. We confirm\nthe trend to find lower metallicities in galaxies of a given stellar mass in a\nyounger Universe. This trend is even observed when taking possible selection\neffects into account that are due to the observed larger median star formation\nrates for galaxies at higher redshifts. We also find a significant evolution of\nthe MNOR up to z = 0.4. Taking the slope of the O/H vs. N/O relation into\naccount for the secondary-nitrogen production regime, the observed evolution of\nthe MNOR is consistent with the trends found for both the MZR and its\nequivalent relation using new expressions to reduce its dependence on SFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 10:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 08:35:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 12:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Recently, there has been great interest in trying to develop methods\nto construct rooted phylogenetic networks from triplets, that is rooted trees\non three species. However, although triplets determine or encode rooted\nphylogenetic trees, they do not in general encode rooted phylogenetic networks,\nwhich is a potential issue for any such method. Motivated by this fact, Huber\nand Moulton recently introduced trinets as a natural extension of rooted\ntriplets to networks. In particular, they showed that level-1 phylogenetic\nnetworks are encoded by their trinets, and also conjectured that all\n\"recoverable\" rooted phylogenetic networks are encoded by their trinets.

One important difference\nwith other typical UED models is the origin of the symmetry leading to the\nstability of the dark matter particle. This symmetry in our case is a remnant\nof the six-dimensional Minkowski space-time symmetry partially broken by the\ncompactification. Another important difference is the very small mass splitting\nbetween the particles of a given Kaluza-Klein tier, which gives a very\nimportant role to co-annihilation effects.

Methods: We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI)\nsituation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz\nwith low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a\nsubset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed\nwith a 0.76 kHz / 1 s resolution. Results: We measured the RFI occupancy in the\nlow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. These values are\nfound to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day\nand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find\nthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR\nresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of\n0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. This rate increases\napproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.\nConclusions: Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR\nradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It\nremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that\nintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for\nthe low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR;\naccurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the\nproximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be\nused once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the\nfrequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB\nstations and windmills.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 13:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-04"}

However, different areas of\nmedical research may have considerably different citation practices, even\nwithin the same medical field. Because of this, it is unclear to what extent\ncitation-based bibliometric indicators allow for valid comparisons between\nresearch units active in different areas of medical research.\n  Methodology: A visualization methodology is introduced that reveals\ndifferences in citation practices between medical research areas. The\nmethodology extracts terms from the titles and abstracts of a large collection\nof publications and uses these terms to visualize the structure of a medical\nfield and to indicate how research areas within this field differ from each\nother in their average citation impact.\n  Results: Visualizations are provided for 32 medical fields, defined based on\njournal subject categories in the Web of Science database. The analysis focuses\non three fields. In each of these fields, there turn out to be large\ndifferences in citation practices between research areas. Low-impact research\nareas tend to focus on clinical intervention research, while high-impact\nresearch areas are often more oriented on basic and diagnostic research.\n  Conclusions: Popular bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the\nimpact factor, do not correct for differences in citation practices between\nmedical fields.

Moreover, near yet above the threshold of black hole formation, the\ncollision initially leads to the formation of two distinct apparent horizons\nthat subsequently merge. We argue that this can be understood in terms of a\nfocusing effect, where one boosted particle acts as a gravitational lens on the\nother and vice versa, and that this is further responsible for the threshold\nbeing lower (by a factor of a few) compared to simple hoop conjecture\nestimates. Cases slightly below threshold result in complete disruption of the\nmodel particles.

Although rare and relatively\nshort-lived, these systems leave detectable evolutionary end points in the form\nof white dwarf - brown dwarf binaries and these remnants can offer unique\ninsights into the births and deaths of their parent systems. We present the\ndiscovery of a close (orbital separation ~ 0.006 AU) substellar companion to a\nmassive white dwarf member of the Praesepe star cluster. Using the cluster age\nand the mass of the white dwarf we constrain the mass of the white dwarf\nprogenitor star to lie in the range 3.5 - 3.7 Msun (B9). The high mass of the\nwhite dwarf means the substellar companion must have been engulfed by the B\nstar's envelope while it was on the late asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Hence,\nthe initial separation of the system was ~2 AU, with common envelope evolution\nreducing the separation to its current value. The initial and final orbital\nseparations allow us to constrain the combination of the common envelope\nefficiency (alpha) and binding energy parameters (lambda) for the AGB star to\nalpha lambda ~3. We examine the various formation scenarios and conclude that\nthe substellar object was most likely to have been captured by the white dwarf\nprogenitor early in the life of the cluster, rather than forming in situ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 15:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 15:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

PID is a least action\nprinciple subject to div$_A$-free constraints for the variational element with\n$A$ being gauge potentials. The Lagrangian action is uniquely determined by 1)\nthe principle of general relativity, 2) the $U(1)$, $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge\ninvariances, 3) the Lorentz invariance, and 4) principle of principle of\nrepresentation invariance (PRI), introduced in [11]. The unified field\nequations are then derived using PID. The unified field model spontaneously\nbreaks the gauge symmetries, and gives rise to a new mechanism for energy and\nmass generation. The unified field model introduces a natural duality between\nthe mediators and their dual mediators, and can be easily decoupled to study\neach individual interaction when other interactions are negligible. The unified\nfield model, together with PRI and PID applied to individual interactions,\nprovides clear explanations and solutions to a number of outstanding challenges\nin physics and cosmology, including e.g. the dark energy and dark matter\nphenomena, the quark confinement, asymptotic freedom, short-range nature of\nboth strong and weak interactions, decay mechanism of sub-atomic particles,\nbaryon asymmetry, and the solar neutrino problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 15:51:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 03:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-27"}
