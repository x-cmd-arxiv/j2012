These open channels are\npotentially useful for fluid management at low Bond numbers. The experiments\nwere performed in a Plateau tank, injecting 2-fluorotoluene into distilled\nwater, density matched at 26.5 $^{o}$C. Extension springs with a nominal\ndiameter of 0.24 inches and with a wire diameter of 0.018 inches were used. At\nsmall extensions, liquid can be injected into the spring from one side. The\ninjected free-ended liquid columns are stable. Volume-constrained stability can\nbe studied after injecting from both sides until coalescence. Stable states\nexist between lower and upper volume stability limits. The low volume\ninstability is manifested by the growth of a neck that eventually breaks. The\nbreakage sends a wave front; the interface ahead of the front is static while\nthe interface behind the front undergoes oscillations. These oscillations\neventually dampen as the free-ends retract until equilibrium states are\nreached. The upper volume instability causes the interface to blow out creating\na large drop that remains connected to the liquid column supported by the\nspring. After a critical pitch, injection is no longer possible from one end.\nHowever, a liquid column established by injection can be stretched beyond the\ncritical pitch for injection. Beyond this pitch, after breakup and blowout the\ninterface undergoes a pearling instability. The resulting free ends retract and\ngrow into drops from which the liquid column eventually breaks. This pearling\ninstability propagates throughout the entire length of the structure largely\nemptying it. Small tracer drops, outside and in the vicinity of the interface,\ntraced helical trajectories as liquid was injected into, and withdrawn from,\nthe spring.

Leaving unspecified the primordial\namplitude of the dipole field, which could in principle be determined by a more\nfundamental description of DDM, we find that, in contrast with usual models of\nprimordial non-Gaussianities, the non-Gaussianity induced by DDM increases with\ntime after the radiation-matter equality on super-Hubble scales.

This neglects the observational fact that the baryonic mass\nfraction in clusters is a random variable that, on average, increases with the\ntotal mass (within an overdensity of 500). Considering a mock catalog that\nincludes tens of thousands of galaxy clusters, as expected from the forthcoming\ngeneration of surveys, we show that the effect of a varying baryonic mass\nfraction will be observable with high statistical significance. The net effect\nis a change in the overall normalization of the cluster mass function and a\nmilder modification of its shape. Our results indicate the necessity of taking\ninto account baryonic corrections to the mass function if one wants to obtain\nunbiased estimates of the cosmological parameters from data of this quality. We\nintroduce the formalism necessary to accomplish this goal. Our discussion is\nbased on the conditional probability of finding a given value of the baryonic\nmass fraction for clusters of fixed total mass. Finally, we show that combining\ninformation from the cluster counts with measurements of the baryonic mass\nfraction in a small subsample of clusters (including only a few tens of\nobjects) will nearly optimally constrain the cosmological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 17:30:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 17:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 12:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

The\ncharacteristic size of the scattering dust grains can be estimated from the\nobserved brightness asymmetry between the front and back side of the disk, for\nexample using standard Mie theory. However such models often overpredict their\nbrightness by one or two orders of magnitude, and have difficulty explaining\nvery red disk colors. We aim to develop a dust model that explains\nsimultaneously the observed disk surface brightness, colors and asymmetry in\nscattered light, focusing on constraining grain sizes. We use the 2D radiative\ntransfer code MCMax with anisotropic scattering to explore the effects of grain\nsize on synthetic scattered light images of circumstellar disks. We compare the\nresults with surface brightness profiles of the protoplanetary disk HD 100546\nin scattered light at wavelengths from 0.4 to 2.2 micron.

In order to\nreach this goal, we apply the X-ray virtual telescope PHOX to generate\nsynthetic observations of the simulated clusters with both Chandra and ATHENA,\nthe latter used as an example for the performance of very high-resolution X-ray\ntelescopes. From Chandra spectra we extract global properties, e.g. luminosity\nand temperature, and from ATHENA spectra we estimate the gas velocity\ndispersion along the line of sight from the broadening of heavy-ion emission\nlines (e.g. Fe). We further extend the analysis to the relation between\nnon-thermal velocity dispersion of the gas and the L_X-T scaling law for the\nsimulated clusters. Interestingly, we find a clear dependence of slope and\nscatter on the selection criterion for the clusters, based on the level of\nsignificance of non-thermal motions. Namely, the scatter in the relation is\nsignificantly reduced by the exclusion of the clusters, for which we estimate\nthe highest turbulent velocities.

We examine the\npossibility of finding such AGN transits in deep optical, UV, and X-ray\nsurveys. We calculate transit lightcurves using the Novikov--Thorne thin\naccretion disk model, including general relatistic effects.

Not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tight\nrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is\nmost physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority of\nthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their\nGIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of\nsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must\nabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench. We discuss a\ntwo-stage model for quenching in which galaxy star formation rates are\ncontrolled by their dark halos while they are still in the blue cloud and a\nsecond quenching process sets in later, associated with the central stellar\nmass build-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 20:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 20:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For classical T\nTauri stars (CTTS, F-K type precursors) the accretion disk does not reach down\nto the central star, but it is truncated near the co-rotation radius. The inner\nedge of the disk is ionized by the stellar radiation, so that the accretion\nstream is funneled along the magnetic field lines. On the stellar surface an\naccretion shock develops, which is observed over a wide wavelength range as\nX-ray emission, UV excess, optical veiling and optical and IR emission lines.\nSome of the accretion tracers, e.g. H\\alpha, can be calibrated to measure the\naccretion rate. This accretion process is variable on time scales of hours to\nyears due to changing accretion rates, stellar rotation and reconfiguration of\nthe magnetic field. Furthermore, many accreting systems also drive strong\noutflows which are ultimately powered by accretion. Several components could\ncontribute to the outflows: slow, wide-angle disk winds, X-winds launched close\nto the inner disk rim, and thermally driven stellar winds. In any case, the\noutflows contain material of very different temperatures and speeds. The disk\nwind is cool and can have a molecular component with just a few tens of km/s,\nwhile the central component of the outflow can reach a few 100 km/s. In some\ncases the inner part of the outflow is collimated to a small-angle jet. These\njets have an onion-like structure, where the inner components are consecutively\nhotter and faster. The jets can contain working surfaces, which show up as\nHerbig-Haro knots. Accretion and outflows in the CTTS phase do not only\ndetermine stellar parameters like the rotation rate on the main-sequence, they\nalso can have a profound impact on the environment of young stars. This review\nconcentrates on CTTS in near-by star forming regions where observations of high\nspatial and spectral resolution are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 20:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We aim to trace the X-ray luminosity of Lyman Break\nGalaxies across cosmic time and from that derive constraints on their star\nformation history. We utilize the newly released 4 Ms mosaic obtained with the\nChandra X-ray Observatory, the deepest X-ray image to date, alongside with the\nsuperb spectroscopic data sets available in the CDF-S survey region to\nconstruct large but nearly uncontaminated samples of LBGs across a wide range\nof redshift (0.5 < z < 4.5) which can be used as input samples for stacking\nexperiments. This approach allows us to trace the X-ray emission of Lyman Break\nGalaxies to even lower, previously unreachable, flux density limits (~10^-18 mW\nm^-2) and therefore to larger redshifts. We reliably detect soft-band X-ray\nemission from all our input redshift bins except for the highest redshift (z~4)\none. From that we derive rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosities and infer star\nformation rates and stellar masses. We find that star formation in LBGs peaks\nat a redshift of z_peak~3.5 and then decreases quickly. We also see a\ncharacteristic peak in the specific star formation rate (sSFR=SFR/M_*) at this\nredshift. Furthermore, we calculate the contribution of LBGs to the total\ncosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and find that the contribution of\nLBGs is negligible.

Evidence for pre-flare heating,\nexplosive and gentle chromospheric evaporation and loop draining were observed\nin the data. The observations were compared to a 0-D hydrodynamic model, EBTEL,\nto aid interpretation. This led to the conclusion that the flare was not heated\npurely by non-thermal beam heating as previously believed, but also required\ndirect heating of the plasma. An observational investigation in to the\ninitiation mechanism of a coronal mass ejection and eruptive flare was then\ncarried out, again utilising observations from a wide range of spacecraft:\nMESSENGER/SAX, RHESSI, EUVI, Cor1 and Cor2. Observations provided evidence of\nCME triggering by internal tether-cutting and not by breakout reconnection. A\ncomparison of the confined and eruptive flares suggests that while they have\ndifferent characteristics, timescales and topologies, these two phenomena are\nthe result of the same fundamental processes.

We present 3D global climate\nsimulations of the early martian climate performed assuming a faint young sun\nand a CO2 atmosphere with pressure between 0.1 and 7 bars. The model includes a\ndetailed radiative transfer model using revised CO2 gas collision induced\nabsorption properties, and a parameterisation of the CO2 ice cloud\nmicrophysical and radiative properties. A wide range of possible climates is\nexplored by using various values of obliquities, orbital parameters, cloud\nmicrophysic parameters, atmospheric dust loading, and surface properties.\nUnlike on present day Mars, for pressures higher than a fraction of a bar,\nsurface temperatures vary with altitude because of the adiabatic cooling and\nwarming of the atmosphere when it moves vertically. In most simulations, CO2\nice clouds cover a major part of the planet but greenhouse effect does not\nexceed +15 K. We find that a CO2 atmosphere could not have raised the annual\nmean temperature above 0{\\deg}C anywhere on the planet. The collapse of the\natmosphere into permanent CO2 ice caps is predicted for pressures higher than 3\nbar, or conversely at pressure lower than one bar if the obliquity is low\nenough. Summertime diurnal mean surface temperatures above 0{\\deg}C (a\ncondition which could have allowed rivers to form) are predicted for obliquity\nlarger than 40{\\deg} at high latitudes but not in locations where most valley\nnetworks are observed.

We also present a\ndetailed analysis of the diffuse X-ray emission, resulting in a tentative\ndetection of a soft excess component best fitted by a thermal model with a\ntemperature of 0.5 keV.

In the event of a positive answer, it generates at least one FSC\nfor the given sandpile. Repeated application of the algorithm can be used to\nfind many distinct FSCs. We also demonstrate a procedure for creating larger\nFSCs from smaller ones and use this to create FSCs for the Manna's model.

For example, many social networks\nattach geo-location information to each user, allowing the study of not only\ntopological interactions between users, but spatial interactions as well. The\ndefining property of spatial networks is that edge distances are associated\nwith a cost, which may subtly influence the topology of the network. However,\nthe cost function over distance is rarely known, thus developing a model of\nconnections in spatial networks is a difficult task.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel model for capturing the interaction\nbetween spatial effects and network structure. Our approach represents a unique\ncombination of ideas from latent variable statistical models and spatial\nnetwork modeling. In contrast to previous work, we view the ability to form\nlong/short-distance connections to be dependent on the individual nodes\ninvolved. For example, a node's specific surroundings (e.g. network structure\nand node density) may make it more likely to form a long distance link than\nother nodes with the same degree. To capture this information, we attach a\nlatent variable to each node which represents a node's spatial reach. These\nvariables are inferred from the network structure using a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo algorithm.\n  We experimentally evaluate our proposed model on 4 different types of\nreal-world spatial networks (e.g. transportation, biological, infrastructure,\nand social). We apply our model to the task of link prediction and achieve up\nto a 35% improvement over previous approaches in terms of the area under the\nROC curve. Additionally, we show that our model is particularly helpful for\npredicting links between nodes with low degrees. In these cases, we see much\nlarger improvements over previous models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 04:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

By selecting\nrotations and cyclic shifts randomly, it can generate $N^3$ alternative OFDM\nsignal sequences, where $N$ is the FFT size.

The objective of semi-supervised classification is to assign a\nlabel to unlabeled nodes using the whole topology of the graph and the labeled\nnodes at our disposal. The BoP betweenness relies on a bag-of-paths framework\nassigning a Boltzmann distribution on the set of all possible paths through the\nnetwork such that long (high-cost) paths have a low probability of being picked\nfrom the bag, while short (low-cost) paths have a high probability of being\npicked. Within that context, the BoP betweenness of node j is defined as the\nsum of the a posteriori probabilities that node j lies in-between two arbitrary\nnodes i, k, when picking a path starting in i and ending in k. Intuitively, a\nnode typically receives a high betweenness if it has a large probability of\nappearing on paths connecting two arbitrary nodes of the network. This quantity\ncan be computed in closed form by inverting a n x n matrix where n is the\nnumber of nodes. For the group betweenness, the paths are constrained to start\nand end in nodes within the same class, therefore defining a group betweenness\nfor each class. Unlabeled nodes are then classified according to the class\nshowing the highest group betweenness. Experiments on various real-world data\nsets show that BoP group betweenness outperforms all the tested state\nof-the-art methods. The benefit of the BoP betweenness is particularly\nnoticeable when only a few labeled nodes are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 07:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-17"}

This emission is due to impact excitation\nof neutral hydrogen by hot protons and electrons in the shocked gas. The\nstructure of such Balmer-dominated shocks has been computed in a previous paper\n(Blasi et al. 2012), where the distribution function of neutral particles was\nderived from the appropriate Boltzmann equation including coupling with ions\nand electrons through charge exchange and ionization. This calculation showed\nhow the presence of neutrals can significantly modify the shock structure\nthrough the formation of a \"neutral-induced\" precursor ahead of the shock. Here\nwe follow up on our previous work and investigate the properties of the\nresulting Balmer emission, with the aim of using the observed radiation as a\ndiagnostic tool for shock parameters. Our main focus is on Supernova Remnant\nshocks, and we find that, for typical parameters, the H{\\alpha} emission\ntypically has a three-component spectral profile, where: 1) a narrow component\noriginates from upstream cold hydrogen atoms, 2) a broad component comes from\nhydrogen atoms that have undergone charge exchange with shocked protons\ndownstream of the shock, and 3) an intermediate component is due to hydrogen\natoms that have undergone charge exchange with warm protons in the\nneutral-induced precursor. The width of the intermediate line reflects the\ntemperature in the precursor, while the width of the narrow one is left\nunaltered by the precursor. In addition, we show that the profiles of both the\nintermediate and broad components generally depart from a thermal distribution.\nFinally, we show that a significant amount of Balmer emission can be produced\nin the precursor region if efficient electron heating takes place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 08:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The transfer of single and double excitation states is\ndiscussed for two different coupling configurations between the qubits. In the\nfirst, the coupling is mediated by the atoms that simultaneously couple to the\ncavity modes. In the second configuration, each atom resides inside one of the\ncavities and the coupling between the cavities is mediated by the overlapping\nfield modes. A proper choice of basis states allows to identify states that\ncould be completely transferred between themselves. Simple expressions are\nderived for the conditions for the complete transfer of quantum states and\nentanglement. These conditions impose severe constraints on the evolution of\nthe system in the form of constants of motion. The constrains on the evolution\nof the system imply that not all states can evolve in time, and we find that\nthe evolution of the entire system can be confined into that occurring among\ntwo states only. Detailed analysis show that in the case where the interaction\nis mediated by the atoms, only symmetric superposition states can be completely\nand reversibly transferred between the atoms and the cavity modes. In the case\nwhere the interaction is mediated by the overlapping field modes, both\nsymmetric and antisymmetric superposition states can be completely transferred.\nWe also show that the system is capable to generate purely photonic NOON\nstates, but only if the coupling is mediated by the atoms, and demonstrate that\nthe ability to generate the NOON states relies on perfect transfer of an\nentanglement from the atoms to the cavity modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 08:32:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 15:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The\nuncertainty relation can be used to argue that a significant part of this\nshower is developed even before a medium can be formed. The initial virtuality\nof a shower-initiating parton is reflected in the final state in the measured\ninvariant mass of a jet - high mass jets are characterized by more branchings,\nhigher multiplicity and a wider angular structure. Since most of this structure\nis determined before the medium affects the jet, selecting a particular jet\nmass range strongly biases the partonic configuration that enters the medium,\nand thus the medium is expected to modify high mass jets more strongly than low\nmass jets.

We are aiming at obtaining estimates of the optical thickness of\nthe circumstellar matter in front of V838 Mon, as well as optical properties of\ndust grains in the echoing medium. In particular, we are interested in studying\nwhether the echoing medium can be responsible for the observed faintness of the\nB-type companion of V838 Mon when compared to three B-type stars that are seen\nin the vicinty of V838 Mon and are believed to be at the same distance as V838\nMon. We used the V838 Mon light echo images obtained by the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) in different filters and epochs. From the images we derived the\ntotal brightness of the echo and its surface brightness. The results of the\nmeasurements were compared to model light echoes. The present study allowed us\nto estimate the optical thickness of the matter in front of the object and the\nmean cosine value of the scattering angle of dust grains in three HST filters.\nThe optical thickness of the echoing matter is not sufficient to explain the\nobserved difference in brightness between the B-type companion of V838 Mon and\nthe other three B-type stars observed in the vicinity of V838 Mon. Implications\nof this result are discussed. Our estimate of the mass of the diffuse matter\nseen in the light echo shows that the matter cannot have resulted form a past\nmass loss activity of V838 Mon. We probably observe remnants of an interstellar\ncloud from which V838 Mon and other members of the observed cluster were\nformed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 09:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

High\nsignal-to-noise spectra have been obtained for 12 novae after the outburst in\nthe last 13 years with the Chandra and XMM-Newton gratings.\n  They offer the only way to probe the temperature, effective gravity and\nchemical composition of the hydrogen burning white dwarf before it turns off.\nThese spectra also allow an analysis of the ejecta, which can be photoionized\nby the hot white dwarf, but more often seem to undergo collisional ionization.\n  The long observations required for the gratings have revealed semi-regular\nand irregular variability in X-ray flux and spectra. Large short term\nvariability is especially evident in the first weeks after the ejecta have\nbecome transparent to the central supersoft X-ray source. Thanks to Chandra and\nXMM-Newton, we have discovered violent phenomena in the ejecta, discrete shell\nejection, and clumpy emission regions.\n  As expected, we have also unveiled the white dwarf characteristics. The peak\nwhite dwarf effective temperature in the targets of our samples varies between\n~400,000 K and over a million K, with most cases closer to the upper end,\nalthough for two novae only upper limits around 200,000 K were obtained. A\ncombination of results from different X-ray satellites and instruments,\nincluding Swift and ROSAT, shows that the shorter is the supersoft X-ray phase,\nthe lower is the white dwarf peak effective temperature, consistently with\ntheoretical predictions. The peak temperature is also inversely correlated with\nt(2) the time for a decay by 2 mag in optical. I strongly advocate the use of\nwhite dwarf atmospheric models to obtain a coherent physical picture of the\nhydrogen burning process and of the surrounding ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 09:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-17"}

Indeed, the Fourier analysis also supported the result. For the first\ntime in the literature, we revealed that the primary component is a delta Scuti\nstar.

Using more than 160 binaries,\nwhose one or both components are pulsating, we derived a new linear fit in the\nplane of log(Porb)-log(Ppulse) for each type binary. Using the linear fit of\neach group, we obtained new calibrations between log(Porb) and log(Ppulse) for\ndifferent type pulsating stars.

In this paper we study\na natural graph class that generalizes both interval and permutation graphs,\nnamely \\emph{simple-triangle} graphs. Simple-triangle graphs - also known as\n\\emph{PI} graphs (for Point-Interval) - are the intersection graphs of\ntriangles that are defined by a point on a line $L_{1}$ and an interval on a\nparallel line $L_{2}$.

Although\nvarious efficient recognition algorithms for permutation and trapezoid graphs\nare well known to exist, the recognition of simple-triangle graphs has remained\nan open problem since their introduction by Corneil and Kamula three decades\nago. In this paper we resolve this problem by proving that simple-triangle\ngraphs can be recognized in polynomial time.

In hotter stars, radiative\naccelerations compete with gravity and become the dominant ingredient in the\ndiffusion flux for most heavy elements. Introducing radiative accelerations\ninto the computations of stellar models modifies the internal element\ndistribution and may have major consequences on the stellar structure. Coupling\nthese processes with hydrodynamical stellar motions has important consequences\nthat need to be investigated in detail.

We investigate the\noxygen-to-hydrogen ratio in the near-Earth magnetosphere from -10 RE<XGSE}< 10\nRE. The results are based on seven years of ion flux measurements in the energy\nrange ~10 keV to ~955 keV from the RAPID and CIS instruments on board the\nCluster satellites. We find that (1) hydrogen ions at ~10 keV show only a\nslight correlation with the geomagnetic conditions and interplanetary magnetic\nfield changes. They are best correlated with the solar wind dynamic pressure\nand density, which is an expected effect of the magnetospheric compression; (2)\n~10 keV O+ ion intensities are more strongly affected during disturbed phase of\na geomagnetic storm or substorm than >274 keV O+ ion intensities, relative to\nthe corresponding hydrogen intensities; (3) In contrast to ~10 keV ions, the\n>274 keV O+ ions show the strongest acceleration during growth phase and not\nduring the expansion phase itself. This suggests a connection between the\nenergy input to the magnetosphere and the effective energization of energetic\nions during growth phase; (4) The ratio between quiet and disturbed times for\nthe intensities of ion ionospheric outflow is similar to those observed in the\nnear-Earth magnetosphere at >274 keV. Therefore, the increase of the energetic\nion intensity during disturbed time is more likely due to the intensification\nthan to the more effective acceleration of the ionospheric source. In\nconclusion, the energization process in the near-Earth magnetosphere is mass\ndependent and it is more effective for the heavier ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 11:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

They are based on the resin\nflow induced, across its thickness, by a pressure applied onto a preform/resin\nstacking. However, both thickness and fiber volume fraction of the final piece\nare not well controlled since they result from complex mechanisms which drive\nthe transient mechanical equilibrium leading to the final geometrical\nconfiguration. In order to optimize both design and manufacturing parameters,\nbut also to monitor the LRI process, an isothermal numerical model has been\ndeveloped which describes the mechanical interaction between the deformations\nof the porous medium and the resin flow during infusion.1, 2 With this\nnumerical model, it is possible to investigate the LRI process of classical\nindustrial part shapes. To validate the numerical model, first in 2D, and to\nimprove the knowledge of the LRI process, this study details a comparison\nbetween numerical simulations and an experimental study of a plate infusion\ntest carried out by LRI process under industrial conditions. From the numerical\nprediction, the filling time, the resin mass and the thickness of the preform\ncan be determined. On another hand, the resin flow and the preform response can\nbe monitored by experimental methods during the filling stage. One key issue of\nthis research study is to highlight the changes in major process parameters\nduring the resin infusion stage, such as the temperature of the preform and\nresin, and the variations of both thickness and fiber volume fraction of the\npreform. Moreover, this numerical/experimental approach is the best way to\nimprove our knowledge on the resin infusion processes, and finally, to develop\nsimulation tools for the design of advanced composite parts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 11:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-17"}

The problem is to design the transfer matrix H so as to minimize the\nmean square error (MSE) when estimating x from y. This problem has important\napplications, but faces at least three hurdles. Firstly, even for a fixed H,\nthe minimum MSE (MMSE) has no analytical form. Secondly, the MMSE is generally\nnot convex in H. Thirdly, derivatives of the MMSE w.r.t. H are hard to obtain.\nThis paper casts the problem as a stochastic program and invokes gradient\nmethods. The study is motivated by two applications in signal processing. One\nconcerns the choice of error-reducing precoders; the other deals with selection\nof pilot matrices for channel estimation. In either setting, our numerical\nresults indicate improved estimation accuracy - markedly better than those\nobtained by optimal design based on standard linear estimators. Some\nimplications of the non-convexities of the MMSE are noteworthy, yet, to our\nknowledge, not well known. For example, there are cases in which more pilot\npower is detrimental for channel estimation.

On using the {\\it F}-statistics to classify the variability nature of\nthese sources, we obtained a duty cycle (DC) of INOV of ~85 percent.\nAlternatively, the more commonly used {\\it C}-statistics gave a DC of INOV of\n~57 percent. Such high DC of INOV are characteristics of the BL Lac class of\nAGN. The results of our monitoring observations thus indicate that there is\nsimilarity in the INOV nature of \\gamma-ray loud NLSy1 galaxies and BL Lac\nobjects, arguing strongly for the presence of relativistic jets aligned closely\nto the observers line of sight.

The detection of short timescale flux variability in the sources\nstudied here is clearly due to stronger time compression leading to the jets in\nthese sources having large Doppler factors, similar to that of the inner jets\nof TeV blazars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 12:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Their\nformation becomes difficult at the transition from the oxygen rich chemistry of\nM-stars to the carbon rich chemistry of C-stars. In the intermediate type\nS-stars oxygen and carbon are consumed by CO and SiO molecule formation, and\nleft-over oxygen to build the SiO4-tetrahedra of silicates becomes scarce. Then\nSiO molecules may directly condense into solid SiO. The IR absorption spectrum\nof solid SiO differs from that of silicates by the absence of Si-O-Si bending\nmodes at 18 mum while the absorption by Si-O bond stretching modes at 10 mum is\npresent. Such characteristics are observed in a number of S-star spectra. We\nsuggest that this observation may be explained by formation of solid SiO as a\nmajor dust component at C/O abundance ratios close to unity. We determine the\nIR absorption properties of solid SiO by laboratory transmission measurements\nof thin SiO films produced by vapour deposition on a Si(111) wafer. From the\nmeasured spectra the dielectric function of SiO is derived. The results are\nused in model calculations of radiative transfer in circumstellar dust shells\nwith solid SiO dust.

The aim is to use DIBs as diagnostics of the local interstellar\nconditions, whilst at the same time deriving properties of the yet-unknown\ncarriers. Spectra of over 800 early-type stars from the VLT Flames Tarantula\nSurvey (VFTS) were analysed. Maps were created, separately, for the Galactic\nand LMC absorption in the DIBs at 4428 and 6614 Ang and - in a smaller region\nnear the central cluster R136 - neutral sodium (Na I D); we also measured the\nDIBs at 5780 and 5797 Ang.

It involves fast temporal modulation of a laser pulse on\nthe fastest instability's amplification time scale, adapting to changing and\nunknown plasma conditions. These pulses are comprised of on and off sequences\nhaving at least one or two orders of magnitude contrast between them. Such\nlaser illumination profiles are called STUD pulses for Spike Trains of Uneven\nDuration and Delay. The STUD pulse program includes scrambling the speckle\npatterns spatially in between the laser spikes. The off times allow damping of\ndriven waves. The scrambling of the hot spots allows tens of damping times to\nelapse before hot spot locations experience recurring high intensity spikes.\nDamping in the meantime will have healed the scars of past growth. Another\nunique feature of STUD pulses on crossing beams is that their temporal profiles\ncan be interlaced or staggered, and their interactions thus controlled with an\non-off switch and a dimmer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 15:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Indeed, in order to prove Four-Color Conjecture, it clearly\nsuffices to show that all maximal planar graphs are 4-colorable. Since this\nconjecture was proposed in 1852, no mathematical proofs have been invented up\nuntil now. Maybe the main reasons lie in the following three aspects in terms\nof maximal planar graphs: not clearing up the structures, not figuring out the\ncoloring types, and not straightening out the relation between structure and\ncoloring. For this, we will write a series of articles to study the structure\nand coloring theory of maximal planar graphs systematically. This is our first\narticle, which focuses mainly on the structure and coloring relations. First,\nwe introduce a new way to construct maximal planar graphs. The advantage of\nthis method is that it establishes an immediate relation with 4-colorings, and\nreveals how a given maximal planar graph is generated. Second, a special class\nof maximal planar graphs--recursive maximal planar graphs is researched in\ndepth, which lays a foundation for solving the uniquely 4-colorable planar\ngraphs conjecture(see subsequent articles). Third, we discover an important\nmode for classifying 4-colorings: tree-coloring and cycle-coloring, which runs\nthrough the whole series of articles. Furthermore, this mode is applied to the\nresearch on an arbitrary 4-coloring and its corresponding structure of unions\nof two and three bicolored subgraphs. Finally, we introduce the concepts of\nblack-white coloring and stamen phenomenon, and find out a necessary and\nsufficient condition for an even cycle to be a 2-colorable cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 12:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-26"}
