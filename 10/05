In this\npaper, we consider how these waves are altered by an anisotropic host (such as\na nematic liquid crystal) or an applied magnetic field. In a liquid crystalline\nhost, with principal axis (director) oriented either parallel or perpendicular\nto the chain, we find that the dispersion relations of both the longitudinal\n($L$) and transverse ($T$) modes are significantly altered relative to those of\nan isotropic host. Furthermore, when the director is perpendicular to the\nchain, the doubly degenerate $T$ branch is split by the anisotropy of the host\nmaterial. With an applied magnetic field ${\\bf B}$ parallel to the chain, the\npropagating transverse modes are circularly polarized, and the left and right\ncircularly polarized branches have slightly different dispersion relations. As\na result, if a linearly polarized transverse wave is launched along the chain,\nit undergoes Faraday rotation. For parameters approximating that of a typical\nmetal and for a field of 2T, the Faraday rotation is of order 1$^o$ per ten\ninterparticle spacings, even taking into account single-particle damping. If\n${\\bf B}$ is perpendicular to the chain, one of the $T$ branches mixes with the\n$L$ branch to form two elliptically polarized branches. Our calculations\ninclude single-particle damping and can, in principle, be generalized to\ninclude radiation damping. The present work suggests that the dispersion\nrelations of plasmonic waves on chain of nanoparticles can be controlled by\nimmersing the chain in a nematic liquid crystal and varying the director axis,\nor by applying a magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 16:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We argue that this is not a real property of the\nradiation at strong coupling, but an artifact of the backreaction calculation,\nwhich is unable to faithfully capture the space-time distribution of the\nradiation. This becomes obvious in the case of a decaying system ('virtual\nphoton'), for which the backreaction is tantamount to computing a three-point\nfunction in the conformal gauge theory, which is independent of the coupling\nsince protected by symmetries. Whereas this non-renormalization property is\nspecific to the conformal N=4 SYM theory, we argue that the failure of the\nthree-point function to provide a local measurement is in fact generic: it\nholds in any field theory with non-trivial interactions. To properly study a\nlocalized distribution, one should rather compute a four-point function, as\nstandard in deep inelastic scattering. We substantiate these considerations\nwith studies of the radiation produced by the decay of a time-like photon at\nboth weak and strong coupling. We show that by computing four-point functions,\nin perturbation theory at weak coupling and, respectively, from Witten diagrams\nat strong coupling, one can follow the quantum evolution and thus demonstrate\nthe broadening of the energy distribution. This broadening is slow when the\ncoupling is weak but it proceeds as fast as possible in the limit of a strong\ncoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 18:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We show exponential separations between its\nlevels, and some of our bounds may be of independent interest. For example, we\nshow that the equality function can be solved by a protocol of constant length\nusing the weakest form of shared randomness, which we call \"XOR-shared\nrandomness.\"\n  Second, we show that quantum communication cannot replace shared randomness\nin the k-party case, where k >= 3 is any constant. We demonstrate a promise\nfunction GP_k that can be computed by a classical protocol of constant length\nwhen (the strongest form of) shared randomness is available, but any quantum\nprotocol without shared randomness must send n^Omega(1) qubits to compute it.\nMoreover, the quantum complexity of GP_k remains n^Omega(1) even if the \"second\nstrongest\" mode of shared randomness is available.

Synapses onto a neuron can be probed by\nsequentially stimulating potentially pre-synaptic neurons while monitoring the\nmembrane voltage of the post-synaptic neuron. Reconstructing a large neural\ncircuit using such a \"brute force\" approach is rather time-consuming and\ninefficient because the connectivity in neural circuits is sparse. Instead, we\npropose to measure a post-synaptic neuron's voltage while stimulating\nsequentially random subsets of multiple potentially pre-synaptic neurons. To\nreconstruct these synaptic connections from the recorded voltage we apply a\ndecoding algorithm recently developed for compressive sensing. Compared to the\nbrute force approach, our method promises significant time savings that grow\nwith the size of the circuit. We use computer simulations to find optimal\nstimulation parameters and explore the feasibility of our reconstruction method\nunder realistic experimental conditions including noise and non-linear synaptic\nintegration. Multineuronal stimulation allows reconstructing synaptic\nconnectivity just from the spiking activity of post-synaptic neurons, even when\nsub-threshold voltage is unavailable. By using calcium indicators,\nvoltage-sensitive dyes, or multi-electrode arrays one could monitor activity of\nmultiple postsynaptic neurons simultaneously, thus mapping their synaptic\ninputs in parallel, potentially reconstructing a complete neural circuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 19:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-05"}

We employ\nthe observed binary properties of the young (150 Myr) open cluster M35, where\npossible, to guide our choices for parameters of the initial binary population.\nAt 7 Gyr the main-sequence solar-type hard-binary population in the model\nmatches that of NGC 188 in both binary frequency and distributions of orbital\nparameters. This agreement between the model and observations is in a large\npart due to the similarities between the NGC 188 and M35 solar-type binaries.\nIndeed, among the 7 Gyr main-sequence binaries in the model, only those with\nP>1000 days show potentially observable evidence for modifications by dynamical\nencounters.

Because a larger cluster is less mobile in Brownian motion,\nit comes into contact with other clusters less frequently. Thus, the formation\nof a giant cluster is suppressed in the DLCA process. All clusters grow\ncontinuously with respect to time, but the largest cluster grows drastically\nwith respect to the number of cluster merging events. Here, we study the\ndiscontinuous PT occurring in the DLCA model in more general dimensions such as\ntwo, three, and four dimensions. PTs are also studied for a generalized\nvelocity, which scales with cluster size $s$ as $v_{s} \\propto s^{\\eta}$. For\nBrownian motion of hard spheres in three dimensions, the mean relative speed\nscales as $s^{-1/2}$ and the collision rate $\\sigma v_s$ scales as $\\sim\ns^{1/6}$. We find numerically that the PT type changes from discontinuous to\ncontinuous as $\\eta$ crosses over a tricritical point $\\eta_{c} \\approx 1.2$\n(in two dimensions), $\\eta_{c} \\approx 0.8$ (in three dimensions), and\n$\\eta_{c} \\approx 0.4$ (in four dimensions).

Finally, we study the reaction-limited cluster aggregation (RLCA)\nmodel in the Brownian process, in which cluster merging takes place with finite\nprobability $r$.

Surely, the position for CTIO could not be in error after five\ndecades? The source of the discrepancy appears to be due to the ~30\" difference\nbetween the astronomical and geodetic positions -- a systematic effect due to\nvertical deflection first reported by Harrington, Mintz Blanco, & Blanco\n(1972). Since the astronomical position is not necessarily the desired quantity\nfor some calculations, and since the number of facilities on Cerro Tololo and\nneighboring Cerro Pachon has grown considerably over the years, I decided to\nmeasure accurate geodetic positions for all of the observatories and some\nselect landmarks on the two peaks using GPS and Google Earth.

We used about 500 days of high-precision,\nhigh-duty-cycle optical photometry collected by Kepler to study the rotation of\nthe star and the evolution of its photospheric active regions. Methods. We\napplied a maximum-entropy light curve inversion technique to model the flux\nrotational modulation induced by active regions that consist of dark spots and\nbright solar-like faculae with a fixed area ratio. Their configuration was\nvaried after a fixed time interval to take their evolution into account. Active\nregions were used as tracers to study stellar differential rotation, and\nplanetary occultations were used to constrain the latitude of some spots.\nResults. Our modelling approach reproduces the light variations of Kepler-17\nwith a standard deviation of the residuals comparable with the precision of\nKepler photometry. We find several active longitudes where individual active\nregions appear, evolve, and decay with lifetimes comparable to those observed\nin the Sun, although the star has a spotted area ~10-15 times larger than the\nSun at the maximum of the 11-yr cycle. Kepler-17 shows a solar-like latitudinal\ndifferential rotation, but the fast spot evolution prevents a precise\ndetermination of its amplitude. Moveover, the star shows a cyclic variation of\nthe starspot area with a period of 47.1 \\pm 4.5 d, particularly evident during\nthe last 200 days of the observations, similar to the solar Rieger cycles.\nPossible effects of the close-in massive planet on stellar photospheric\nactivity cannot be excluded, but require a long-term monitoring to be\nunambiguously detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 08:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

However, both turbulence and discontinuities are present in the\nsolar wind on these inertial range of scales. We identify and remove these\ndiscontinuities using a method which for the first time does not impose a\ncharacteristic scale on the resultant time-series. The PSD of vector field\nfluctuations obtained from at-a point observations is a tensor that can in\nprinciple be anisotropic with scaling exponents that depend on background field\nand flow direction. This provides a key test of theories of turbulence. We find\nthat the removal of discontinuities from the observed time-series can\nsignificantly alter the PSD trace anisotropy. It becomes quasi-isotropic, in\nthat the observed exponent does not vary with the background field angle once\nthe discontinuities are removed. This is consistent with the predictions of the\nIroshnikov-Kraichnan model of turbulence.

The combined results form a detailed temporal\nformat profile of the corpus, which we have made available as open data. We\npresent the results of our initial analysis of this dataset. We look at image,\nHTML and PDF resources in some detail, showing how the usage of different\nformats, versions and software implementations has changed over time.\nFurthermore, we show that software obsolescence is rare on the web and uncover\nevidence indicating that network effects act to stabilise formats against\nobsolescence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 11:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-08"}

This is an empirically\nuntestable thesis and thus lies beyond the scope of science. However, this\nargument presupposes a conception of science which holds that in science\ntheories are accepted solely on the basis of evidence. But this conception of\nscience is untenable. Any fundamental physical theory, in order to be accepted\nas a part of theoretical scientific knowledge, must be (1) sufficiently\nempirically successful, and (2) sufficiently unified. Given any accepted theory\nof physics, endlessly many empirically more successful disunified rivals can\nalways be concocted - disunified because they assert that different dynamical\nlaws govern the diverse phenomena to which the theory applies. These disunified\nrivals are not considered for a moment in physics, despite their greater\nempirical success. This persistent rejection of empirically more successful but\ndisunified rival theories means, I argue, that a big, highly problematic,\nimplicit assumption is made by science about the cosmos, to the effect, at\nleast, that the cosmos is such that all seriously disunified theories are\nfalse. Once this point is recognized, it becomes clear, I argue, that we need a\nnew conception of science which holds that science makes a hierarchy of\nassumptions about the cosmos, these assumptions becoming less and less\nsubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy. One of these assumptions is that the\ncosmos is physically comprehensible. Hence the conclusion: improve our ideas\nabout the nature of science and it becomes apparent that science has\nestablished that the cosmos is physically comprehensible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 13:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-08"}

In this paper,\nwe present regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a novel computational\nframework that performs posterior inference with a regularization term on the\ndesired post-data posterior distribution under an information theoretical\nformulation. RegBayes is more flexible than the procedure that elicits expert\nknowledge via priors, and it covers both directed Bayesian networks and\nundirected Markov networks whose Bayesian formulation results in hybrid chain\ngraph models.

Here, we exploit the non-linear conversion operation in the\neavesdropper's receiver to obtain the desired advantage - even when the\neavesdropper has perfect access to the transmitted signal at the input to their\nreceiver. The basic idea is to employ an ephemeral cryptographic key to force\nthe eavesdropper to conduct two operations, at least one of which is\nnon-linear, in a different order than the desired recipient. Since non-linear\noperations are not necessarily commutative, the desired advantage can be\nobtained and information-theoretic secrecy achieved even if the eavesdropper is\ngiven the cryptographic key immediately upon transmission completion. In\nessence, the lack of knowledge of the key during the short transmission time\ninhibits the recording of the signal in such a way that the secret information\ncan never be extracted from it. The achievable secrecy rates for different\ncountermeasures that the eavesdropper might employ are evaluated.

Along the way we\nmention the Universal Parabolic Constant (an analog of pi) and an origami fold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 08:01:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 17:31:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 May 2013 16:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-02"}

Taking the MapReduce\n(MR) framework as our inspiration we introduce a distributed approach for\nperforming formal concept mining. Our method has its novelty in that we use a\nlight-weight MapReduce runtime called Twister which is better suited to\niterative algorithms than recent distributed approaches. First, we describe the\ntheoretical foundations underpinning our distributed formal concept analysis\napproach. Second, we provide a representative exemplar of how a classic\ncentralized algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion using our\nmethodology: we modify Ganter's classic algorithm by introducing a family of\nMR* algorithms, namely MRGanter and MRGanter+ where the prefix denotes the\nalgorithm's lineage. To evaluate the factors that impact distributed algorithm\nperformance, we compare our MR* algorithms with the state-of-the-art.\nExperiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate that MRGanter+ is efficient,\nscalable and an appealing algorithm for distributed problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 10:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-10"}

For X-ray binaries, in\norder to explain observed quasi-periodic oscillations, our model predicts the\nspin parameter of underlying black holes. On the other hand, the nature of spin\nparameters of black holes in BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars is\npredicted by studying the total luminosities of systems based on Fermi\ngamma-ray data.

In the clinical practice domain, the\nsemantic gap between clinical information systems and domain ontologies is\nquite often difficult to bridge in one step. In this paper, we report our\nexperience in using a two-step formalization approach to formalize clinical\ndata, i.e. from database schemas to local formalisms and from local formalisms\nto domain (unifying) formalisms. We use N3 rules to explicitly and formally\nstate the mapping from local ontologies to domain ontologies. The resulting\ndata expressed in domain formalisms can be integrated and analyzed, though\noriginating from very distinct sources. Practices of applying the two-step\napproach in the infectious disorders and cancer domains are introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 09:49:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 11:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-25"}

This security\nbreach is classified as an unauthorized use of Card, and it forms the bedrock\nfor RFID Card compromise especially in access control. As an on-card\nauthentication mechanism, this research proposed a concept termed Bio-Thentic\nCard, which can be adopted to prevent this single point of failure of RFID\nCard.
