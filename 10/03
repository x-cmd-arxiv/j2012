An attractive feature of this theory is that with the correct\nhomotopical approach - homotopy slices, homotopy pullbacks, homotopy colimits,\netc. - the groupoid case looks exactly like the set case. After some standard\nexamples, I will illustrate the notion of data-types-with-symmetries with\nexamples from quantum field theory, where the symmetries of complicated tree\nstructures of graphs play a crucial role, and can be handled elegantly using\npolynomial functors over groupoids.

Here we extend this framework by localizing the\nangular momentum of the linearized gravitational field, deriving a\ngravitational spin tensor which possesses similarly desirable properties. By\nexamining the local exchange of angular momentum (between matter and gravity)\nwe find that gravitational intrinsic spin is localized, separately from orbital\nangular momentum, in terms of a gravitational spin tensor. This spin tensor is\nthen uniquely determined by requiring that it obey two simple physically\nmotivated algebraic conditions. Firstly, the spin of an arbitrary\n(harmonic-gauge) gravitational plane wave is required to flow in the direction\nof propagation of the wave. Secondly, the spin tensor of any\ntransverse-traceless gravitational field is required to be traceless. (The\nsecond condition ensures that local field redefinitions suffice to cast our\ngravitational energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor as sources of gravity in a\nquadratic approximation to general relativity.) Additionally, the following\nproperties arise in the spin tensor spontaneously: all transverse-traceless\nfields have purely spatial spin, and any field generated by a static\ndistribution of matter will carry no spin at all. Following the structure of\nour previous paper, we then examine the (spatial) angular momentum exchanged\nbetween the gravitational field and an infinitesimal detector, and develop a\nmicroaveraging procedure that renders the process gauge-invariant. The exchange\nof nonspatial angular momentum (i.e., moment of energy) is also analyzed,\nleading us to conclude that a gravitational wave can displace the center of\nmass of the detector; this conclusion is also confirmed by a first principles\ntreatment of the system.

The analysis is based on 48\nhigh-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra collected with UVES at the ESO\nVLT between 2003 and 2011 referring to 12 comets of different origins observed\nat various heliocentric distances. The flux ratio of the green line to the sum\nof the two red lines is evaluated to determine the parent species of the oxygen\natoms by comparison with theoretical models. This analysis confirms that, at\nabout 1 AU, H2O is the main parent molecule producing oxygen atoms. At\nheliocentric distances > 2.5 AU, this ratio is changing rapidly, an indication\nthat other molecules are starting to contribute. CO and CO2, the most abundant\nspecies after H2O in the coma, are good candidates and the ratio is used to\nestimate their abundances. We found that the CO2 abundance relative to H2O in\ncomet C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) observed at 4 AU can be as high as ~70 %. The intrinsic\nwidths of the oxygen lines were also measured. The green line is on average\nabout 1 km/s broader than the red lines while the theory predicts the red lines\nto be broader.

Informed by the statistical characteristics of the\nstate variable of interest, the central results of the paper suggest that\nproper regularization can lead to a more accurate and stable recovery of the\ntrue state and hence more skillful forecasts. In particular, using the Tikhonov\nand Huber regularization in the derivative space, the promise of the proposed\nframework is demonstrated in static downscaling and fusion of synthetic\nmulti-sensor precipitation data, while a data assimilation numerical experiment\nis presented using the heat equation in a variational setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 17:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-15"}

We revisit and extend the\nnon-consensus opinion (NCO) model introduced by Shao. We generalize the NCO\nmodel by adding a weight factor W to individual's own opinion when determining\nits future opinion (NCOW model). We find that as W increases the minority\nopinion holders tend to form stable clusters with a smaller initial minority\nfraction compared to the NCO model. We also revisit another non-consensus\nopinion, the inflexible contrarian opinion (ICO) model, which introduces\ninflexible contrarians to model a competition between two opinions in the\nsteady state. In the ICO model, the inflexible contrarians effectively decrease\nthe size of the largest cluster of the rival opinion. All of the above models\nhave previously been explored in terms of a single network. However opinions\npropagate not only within single networks but also between networks, we study\nhere the opinion dynamics in coupled networks. We apply the NCO rule on each\nindividual network and the global majority rule on interdependent pairs. We\nfind that the interdependent links effectively force the system from a second\norder phase transition, which is characteristic of the NCO model on a single\nnetwork, to a hybrid phase transition, i.e., a mix of second-order and abrupt\njump-like transitions that ultimately becomes, as we increase the percentage of\ninterdependent agents, a pure abrupt transition. We conclude that for the NCO\nmodel on coupled networks, interactions through interdependent links could push\nthe non-consensus opinion type model to a consensus opinion type model, which\nmimics the reality that increased mass communication causes people to hold\nopinions that are increasingly similar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 18:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 14:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Galaxy clusters are excellent targets to search for or to constrain\nthe rate of dark matter annihilation, as they are both massive and dark matter\ndominated. In this study, we place limits on dark matter annihilation in a\nsample of nearby clusters using upper limits on the diffuse radio emission, low\nlevels of observed diffuse emission, or detections of radio mini-haloes. We\nfind that the strongest limits on the annihilation cross section are better\nthan limits derived from the non-detection of clusters in the gamma-ray band by\na factor of approximately 3 or more when the same annihilation channel and\nsubtructure model, but different best-case clusters, are compared. The limits\non the cross section depend on the assumed amount of substructure, varying by\nas much as 2 orders of magnitude for increasingly optimistic substructure\nmodels as compared to a smooth NFW profile. In our most optimistic case, using\nthe results of the Phoenix Project (Gao et al. 2012b) we find that the derived\nlimits reach below the thermal relic cross section of 3x10^-26 cm^3 s^-1 for\ndark matter masses as large as 400 GeV, for the bbar annihilation channel. We\ndiscuss uncertainties due to the limited available data on the magnetic field\nstructure of individual clusters. We also report the discovery of diffuse radio\nemission from the central 30-40 kpc regions of the groups M49 and NGC4636.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 18:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We\nfind that, if the dynamical excitation of the disk is small, temporary capture\nin the Pluto-Charon system can occur with non-negligible probability, due to\nthe dynamical perturbations exerted by the binary nature of the Pluto-Charon\npair. However, the captured objects remain on very elliptic orbits and the\ntypical capture time is only 100 years. In order to explain the origin of the\nsmall satellites of Pluto, we conjecture that some of these objects got\ndisrupted during their Pluto-bound phase by a collision with a planetesimal of\nthe disk. This could have generated a debris disk, which damped under internal\ncollisional evolution, until turning itself into an accretional disk that could\nform small satellites on circular orbits, co-planar with Charon. Unfortunately,\nwe find that objects large enough to carry a sufficient amount of mass to\ngenerate the small satellites of Pluto have collisional lifetimes orders of\nmagnitude longer than the capture time. Thus, this scenario cannot explain the\norigin of the small satellites of Pluto, which remains elusive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 18:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A particular feature\nof interest comes from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs), which are sound\nwaves traveling in the hot plasma of the early Universe that stopped at the\nrecombination time. This feature can be observed as a localized bump in the\ncorrelation function at the scale of the sound horizon $r_s$. As such, it\nprovides a standard ruler and a lot of constraining power in the correlation\nfunction analysis of galaxy surveys. Moreover the detection of BAOs at the\nexpected scale gives a strong support to cosmological models. Both of these\nstudies (BAO detection and parameter constraints) rely on a statistical\nmodeling of the measured correlation function $\\hat{\\xi}$. Usually $\\hat{\\xi}$\nis assumed to be gaussian, with a mean $\\xi_\\theta$ depending on the\ncosmological model and a covariance matrix $C$ generally approximated as a\nconstant (i.e. independent of the model). In this article we study whether a\nrealistic model-dependent $C_\\theta$ changes the results of cosmological\nparameter constraints compared to the approximation of a constant covariance\nmatrix $C$. For this purpose, we use a new procedure to generate lognormal\nrealizations of the Luminous Red Galaxies sample of the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Data Release 7 to obtain a model-dependent $C_\\theta$ in a reasonable\ntime. The approximation of $C_\\theta$ as a constant creates small changes in\nthe cosmological parameter constraints on our sample. We quantify this modeling\nerror using a lot of simulations and find that it only has a marginal influence\non cosmological parameter constraints for current and next-generation galaxy\nsurveys.

We employ a\nfermionic parton description that captures both the insulating phases as well\nas the transition between them. The critical theory is massless QED-3 with Nf =\n2 fermion flavors. The fermions have a surprisingly simple interpretation -\nthey are vortices of the superfluid. Therefore the universal conductivity at\nthe transition, assuming it is continuous, equals the universal resistivity of\nDirac fermions in QED-3. We also briefly comment on sigma model descriptions of\nthe transition and the surface states of related 3D SPT phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-05"}

In spacetime as a whole, therefore,\nquantum information is widely replicated but in a restricted fashion. We fully\ncharacterize which regions of spacetime can all hold the same quantum\ninformation. Because quantum information can be delocalized through quantum\nerror correction and teleportation, it need not follow well-defined\ntrajectories. Instead, replication of the information in any configuration of\nspacetime regions not leading to violations of causality or the no-cloning\nprinciple is allowed. To demonstrate this, we answer the operational question\nof exactly when the information can be summoned to a set of spacetime points,\nshowing how to do so efficiently using a combination of teleportation and\ncodeword-stabilized quantum codes.

The present\npaper focuses on the anomalous appearence of strong infrared phonon resonances\nin the optical spectroscopy of bilayer graphene and on their pronounced\nFano-like asymmetry, both tunable in gated devices. By developing a full\nmicroscopic many-body approach for the optical phonon response we explain how\nboth effects can be quantitatively accounted for by the quantum interference of\nelectronic and phononic excitations. We show that the phonon modes borrow a\nlarge dipole intensity from the electronic background, the so-called\ncharged-phonon effect, and at the same time interfer with it, leading to a\ntypical Fano response. Our approach allows one to disentangle the correct\nselection rules that control the relative importance of the two (symmetric and\nantisymmetric) relevant phonon modes for different values of the doping and/or\nof the gap in bilayer graphene. Finally, we discuss the extension of the same\ntheoretical scheme to the Raman spectroscopy, to explain the lack of the same\nfeatures on the Raman phononic spectra.

In this paper, we show that the most intriguing stage of such\ngrowth --- namely, the transformation of 1-10 m boulders into kilometre-sized\nplanetesimals --- can be explained by a mechanism of gravitational instability.\nThe present work focused on the origin of self-gravitating clumps in which\nplanetesimal formation could take place. Our computer simulations demonstrated\nthat such clumps of gas and boulders formed due to the development of a\ntwo-phase instability. This instability revealed a so-called 'mutual influence\neffect' in the protoplanetary disc, where the dynamics of the system were\ndetermined by the collisionless collective motion of a low-mass subdisc\ncomposed of primary solids. We found that a 0.1 $c_s$ velocity dispersion in\nthe boulder subdisc was sufficient to cause the formation of self-gravitating\nclumps of gas and boulders. In such regimes, the time needed for the formation\nof the collapsing objects was less than the boulders' dissipation time in the\ndensity waves of the medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 04:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We carry out Monte Carlo simulations to model the formation and\nevolution of RH in a cosmological framework by assuming that RH are either\ngenerated in turbulent merging clusters, or are purely hadronic sources\ngenerated in more relaxed clusters, \"off-state\" halos. The models predict that\nthe luminosity function of RH at high radio luminosities is dominated by the\ncontribution of RH generated in turbulent clusters.

By\nrestricting to clusters at z<0.6, we show that the planned EMU+WODAN surveys at\n1.4 GHz have the potential to detect up to ~200 RH, increasing their number by\none order of magnitude.

Exploiting the\ncorrelation of gas to dust mass with metallicity (Mgas/Mdust -Z), we use our\nmeasurements to constrain the gas content, CO-to-H2 conversion factors (a_co)\nand star formation efficiencies (SFE) of these distant galaxies. Using large\nstatistical samples, we confirm that a_co and SFE are an order of magnitude\nhigher and lower, respectively, in MS galaxies at high redshifts compared to\nthe values of local galaxies with equivalently high infrared luminosities. For\ngalaxies within the MS, we show that the variations of specific star formation\nrates (sSFR=SFR/M*) are driven by varying gas fractions. For relatively massive\ngalaxies like those in our samples, we show that the hardness of the radiation\nfield, <U>, which is proportional to the dust mass weighted luminosity\n(LIR/Mdust), and the primary parameter defining the shape of the SED, is\nequivalent to SFE/Z. For MS galaxies we measure this quantity, <U>, showing\nthat it does not depend significantly on either the stellar mass or the sSFR.\nThis is explained as a simple consequence of the existing correlations between\nSFR-M*, M*-Z and Mgas-SFR. Instead, we show that <U> (or LIR/Mdust) does\nevolve, with MS galaxies having harder radiation fields and thus warmer\ntemperatures as redshift increases from z=0 to 2, a trend which can also be\nunderstood based on the redshift evolution of the M*-Z and SFR-M* relations.\nThese results motivate the construction of a universal set of SED templates for\nMS galaxies which vary as a function of redshift with only one parameter, <U>.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 09:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 21:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The situation however changed dramatically in the\npresence of magnetic field produced by the accretion disk surrounding the hole\nin the equatorial plane. In 1985, Wagh, Dhurandhar and Dadhich had for the\nfirst time considered the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in which the magnetic\nfield could now provide the energy required for a fragment to ride on negative\nenergy orbit thereby overcoming the stringent velocity constraint of the\noriginal PP. Thus MPP turned very efficient and so much so that efficiency\ncould now even exceed 100 percent. They had in principle established revival of\nPP for astrophysical applications in powering the high energy sources. MPP is\nhowever similar to the earlier discovered and well known Blandford-Znajeck (BZ)\nmechanism in which the rotational energy of the hole is extracted out through a\npurely electromagnetic process. Though both the processes use magnetic field as\na device to extract rotational energy from the hole, yet their kernel is quite\ndifferent in spirit. For the former magnetic field provides the threshold\nenergy for particle to get onto negative energy orbit so that the other\nfragment goes out with enhanced energy while for the latter it generates an\nelectric potential difference between the equatorial plane and the polar\nregion, and it is the discharge of which that drives the energy flux out of the\nhole. In other words, MPP is still rooted in the spacetime geometry while BZ is\nessentially driven by electromagnetic interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 09:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-04"}

The main ingredient of the theory used in\nour analysis, a severely constrained kinetic mixing from the two U(1) gauge\nfactors and massive hidden photons, entails both photon into hidden state\noscillations and a minuscule coupling of hidden photons to visible matter, of\nwhich the latter our experimental setup has been designed to observe. On a\ntheoretical side, full account was taken of the effects of refraction and\ndamping of photons while propagating in Sun's interior as well as in the\ndetector. We exclude hidden photons with kinetic couplings chi > (2.2 x\n10^{-13}- 3 x 10^{-7}) in the mass region 0.2 eV < m_gamma' < 30 keV. Our\nconstraints on the mixing parameter chi in the mass region from 20 eV up to 15\nkeV prove even slightly better then those obtained recently by using data from\nthe CAST experiment, albeit still somewhat weaker than those obtained from\nsolar and HB stars lifetime arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 09:25:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 14:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 11:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-16"}

The faintest\nmember of this triplet SDSS J0723+3624 is one of the most gas rich galaxies\nknown. We find that all three galaxies deviate significantly from the\nTully-Fisher relation, but follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. All three\ngalaxies also have a baryon fraction that is significantly smaller than the\ncosmic baryon fraction. For the largest galaxy in the triplet, this is in\ncontradiction to numerical simulations. The discovery of this very unique dwarf\ntriplet lends support to the idea that the void environment is conducive to the\nformation of galaxies with unusual properties. These observations also provide\nfurther motivation to do deep searches of voids for a \"hidden\" very gas-rich\ngalaxy population with M_B > -11.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 11:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-04"}

However, the performance of each of\nthese tools is contingent on the length and quality of the sequencing data, the\nstructure and complexity of the genome sequence, and the resolution and quality\nof long-range information. Furthermore, in the absence of any metric that\ncaptures the most fundamental \"features\" of a high-quality assembly, there is\nno obvious recipe for users to select the most desirable assembler/assembly.\nInternational competitions such as Assemblathons or GAGE tried to identify the\nbest assembler(s) and their features. Some what circuitously, the only\navailable approach to gauge de novo assemblies and assemblers relies solely on\nthe availability of a high-quality fully assembled reference genome sequence.\nStill worse, reference-guided evaluations are often both difficult to analyze,\nleading to conclusions that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we\ncircumvent many of these issues by relying upon a tool, dubbed FRCbam, which is\ncapable of evaluating de novo assemblies from the read-layouts even when no\nreference exists. We extend the FRCurve approach to cases where lay-out\ninformation may have been obscured, as is true in many deBruijn-graph-based\nalgorithms.

The deformed symmetry\nstructure allows us to obtain exact solutions of the noncommutative Einstein\nequations in many of our models.\n  In part two we develop a new formalism for quantum field theory on\nnoncommutative curved spacetimes by combining methods from the algebraic\napproach to quantum field theory with noncommutative differential geometry.

Here, we quantify the\nluminosities of HII region either coincident with, or nearby to the ccSNe.\nCharacteristic nebulae are long-lived (~20 Myr) giant HII regions rather than\nshort-lived (~4 Myr) isolated, compact HII regions. Therefore, the absence of a\nHII region from most type II ccSNe merely reflects the longer lifetime of stars\nwith <12 Msun than giant HII regions. Conversely, the association of a HII\nregion with most type Ib/c ccSNe is due to the shorter lifetime of stars with\n>12 Msun stars than the duty cycle of giant HII regions. Therefore, we conclude\nthat the observed association between certain ccSNe and HII provides only weak\nconstraints upon their progenitor masses.

Within the next decade, systems will contain large numbers\nof processors with potentially thousands of processors per chip.

It is therefore essential that highly-parallel\narchitectures can support sequential computation by emulating large memories\nwith collections of smaller ones, thus supporting efficient execution of\nsequential programs or sequential components of parallel programs.\n  This paper demonstrates that a realistic parallel architecture with scalable\nlow-latency communications can execute large-memory sequential programs with a\nfactor of only 2 to 3 slowdown, when compared to a conventional sequential\narchitecture. This overhead seems an acceptable price to pay to be able to\nswitch between executing highly-parallel programs and sequential programs with\nlarge memory requirements.
