Aims: New data from ground-based\ngamma-ray telescopes and the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope are used to test this hypothesis. A simple model for gamma-ray\nproduction efficiency is compared with measured gamma-ray luminosities of SNRs,\nand the GeV to TeV fluxes ratios of SNRs are examined for correlations with SNR\nages. Methods: The supernova explosion is modeled as an expanding spherical\nshell of material that sweeps up matter from the surrounding interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The accumulated kinetic energy of the shell, which provides the\nenergy available for nonthermal particle acceleration, changes when matter is\nswept up from the ISM and the SNR shell decelerates. A fraction of this energy\nis assumed to be converted into the energy of cosmic-ray electrons or protons.\nThree different particle radiation processes---nuclear pion-production\ninteractions, nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung, and Compton scattering---are\nconsidered. Results: The efficiencies for gamma-ray production by these three\nprocesses are compared with gamma-ray luminosities of SNRs. Our results suggest\nthat SNRs become less gamma-ray luminous at >~ 10^4 yr, and are consistent with\nthe hypothesis that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic rays with an\nefficiency of ~10% for the dissipation of kinetic energy into nonthermal cosmic\nrays.

The generation of\na stable frequency, the basic function of oscillators, is typically achieved by\nincreasing the amplitude of motion of the resonator while remaining within its\nlinear, harmonic, regime. Contrary to this conventional paradigm, in this\nLetter we show that by operating the oscillator at special points in the\nresonators anharmonic regime we can overcome fundamental limitations of\noscillator performance due to thermodynamic noise as well as practical\nlimitations due to noise from the sustaining circuit.

We present a mathematical model that aims to understand how small RNA\ncompetition for the PTR resources affects target gene repression. We discuss\nthat small RNA activity is limited by RISC-formation, RISC-degradation and the\navailability of Argonautes.

The\neffects of magnetic twist on stable magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves is poorly\nunderstood because they are seldom studied for relevant cases. The goal of this\nwork is to study the fingerprints of magnetic twist on stable transverse kink\noscillations. We numerically calculated the eigenmodes of propagating and\nstanding MHD waves for a model of a loop with magnetic twist. The azimuthal\ncomponent of the magnetic field was assumed to be small in comparison to the\nlongitudinal component. We did not consider resonantly damped modes or kink\ninstabilities in our analysis. For a nonconstant twist the frequencies of the\nMHD wave modes are split, which has important consequences for standing waves.\nThis is different from the degenerated situation for equilibrium models with\nconstant twist, which are characterised by an azimuthal component of the\nmagnetic field that linearly increases with the radial coordinate. In the\npresence of twist standing kink solutions are characterised by a change in\npolarisation of the transverse displacement along the tube. For weak twist, and\nin the thin tube approximation, the frequency of standing modes is unaltered\nand the tube oscillates at the kink speed of the corresponding straight tube.\nThe change in polarisation is linearly proportional to the degree of twist.\nThis has implications with regard to observations of kink modes, since the\ndetection of this variation in polarisation can be used as an indirect method\nto estimate the twist in oscillating loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 17:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In particular, many desirable\nlevels of heuristic success cannot be obtained unless severe, highly unlikely\ncomplexity class collapses occur. Second, we survey work initiated by Goldreich\nand Wigderson, who showed how under plausible assumptions deterministic\nheuristics for randomized computation can achieve a very high frequency of\ncorrectness.

Individual modal ridges can be clearly seen with reduced\npower in the k-omega diagram constructed by use of 40-hour observation of a\nstable and round sunspot. Comparing with the k-omega diagram obtained from a\nquiet-Sun region, inside the sunspot the f-mode ridge gets more power reduction\nthan p-mode ridges, especially at high wavenumber. The p-mode ridges all shift\ntoward lower-wavenumber (or higher-frequency) areas for a given frequency (or\nwavenumber), implying an increase of phase velocity beneath the sunspot. This\nprobably results from acoustic waves' travel across the inclined magnetic field\nof the sunspot penumbra. Line-profile asymmetries exhibited in the p-mode\nridges are more significant in the sunspot than in quiet Sun. Convection inside\nthe sunspot is also highly suppressed, and its characteristic spatial scale is\nsubstantially larger than the typical convection scale of quiet Sun.

The damping parameter of the two modes\ndepends on both the size of the nanomagnet as well as the particular spin-wave\nmode that is excited, with values that are enhanced by as much as 40% relative\nto that measured for an extended film. Contrary to expectations based on the ad\nhoc consideration of lithography-induced edge damage, the damping for the\nend-mode decreases as the size of the nanomagnet decreases. The data agree with\nthe theory for damping caused by the flow of intralayer transverse\nspin-currents driven by the magnetization curvature. These results have serious\nimplications for the performance of nanoscale spintronic devices such as\nspin-torque-transfer magnetic random access memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 18:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2012 00:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 17:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-15"}

By interacting them with laser beams they are, somehow,\neasy to manipulate, which makes them an excellent choice for the production of\nnonclassical states of their vibrational motion, the reconstruction of\nquasiprobability distribution functions, the production of quantum gates, etc.\nHowever, most of these effects have been produced in the so-called low\nintensity regime, this is, when the Rabi frequency is much smaller than the\ntrap frequency. Because of the possibility to produce faster quantum gates in\nother regimes it is of importance to study this system in a more complete\nmanner, which is the motivation for this contribution. We start by studying the\nway ions are trapped in Paul traps in and review the basic mechanisms of\ntrapping.

We show how in the\nlow intensity regime Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings interactions may\nbe obtained, without using the rotating wave approximation and analyze the\nmedium and high intensity regimes were dispersive Hamiltonians are produced.\nThe traditional approach is also studied and used for the generation of\nnon-classical states of the vibrational of the vibrational wavefunction.

It is also\nshown how squeezing may be measured. The time dependent problem is studied by\nusing Lewis-Ermakov methods, we give a solution to the problem when the time\ndependence of the trap is considered and also analyze an specific time\ndependence that produces squeezing of the initial vibrational wave function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 19:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We quantize only\nthe waterfall field, treating it as a free quantum field with a time-dependent\n$m^2$, which evolves from positive values to tachyonic values. Although this\npotential has no minimum, we think it captures the important dynamics that\noccurs as $m^2$ goes through zero, at which time a large spike in the density\nperturbations is generated. We assume that the time-delay formalism provides an\naccurate approximation to the density perturbations, and proceed to calculate\nthe power spectrum of the time delay fluctuations. While the evolution of the\nfield is linear, the time delay is a nonlinear function to which all modes\ncontribute. Using the Gaussian probability distribution of the mode amplitudes,\nwe express the time-delay power spectrum as an integral which can be carried\nout numerically.

The results show continued increases in column densities\nof K I and Ca I since observations ~ 4 yr earlier, as the transverse motion of\nthe star carried it ~ 10 AU perpendicular to the line of sight. Line profile\nmodels are fitted to the spectra and two main narrow components (A & B) are\nidentified for all species except CH. The column density N(K I) is found to\nhave increased by 82 +10-9 % between 1994 and 2006, whilst N(Ca I) is found to\nhave increased by 32 +- 5 % over the shorter period of 2002-2006. The line\nwidths are used to constrain the kinetic temperature to T_k,A < 671 +18-17 K\nand T_k,B < 114 +15-14 K. Electron densities are determined from the Ca I / Ca\nII ratio, which in turn place lower limits on the total number density of n_A >\n7 * 10^3 cm^-3 and n_B > 2 * 10^4 cm^-3. Calcium depletions are estimated from\nthe Ca I / K I ratio. Comparison with the chemical models of Bell et al.

If the BHs are retained by the cluster after merging with a NS, the\nBHs acquire subsequent NS companions and undergo several mergers. Thus, the\nmerger rate depends critically upon whether or not the BH is retained by the\ncluster after the merger.

Combining this new event with the single KBO occultation reported by\nSchlichting et al.

The aim of this analysis is to look for\nsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies and\ncompare them to kinematic properties. Using Sersic index from single component\nfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- and\nearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. Assuming that objects with n>3 are\nslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability to\ncorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previously\nclassified as ellipticals). We show that exponential sub-components, as well as\nlight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low Sersic index, can\nbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. The\nmedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,\nrespectively. Similarly, the median Sersic indices of the bulge (general Sersic\ncomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. Overall,\ndiscs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-type\ngalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-total\nlight ratios. Discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent to\nthe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. The decomposition into\ndiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separation\nbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a\n59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. Kinematics (i.e.\nprojected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influence\nof the inclination effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 21:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 21:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We find\nthat the recent detailed observations of the surface brightness profile and the\nvelocity dispersion profile for this galaxy are consistent with the\nphenomenology expected in MONDian theories of modified gravity, without the\nneed of invoking the presence of any hypothetical dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 22:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 19:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Holography provides images of dish\nillumination pattern, allowing characterization of as-built mirror surfaces.\nThe ATA dishes can experience mm-scale distortions across -2 meter lengths due\nto mounting stresses or solar radiation. Experimental RMS errors are 0.7 mm at\nnight and 3 mm under worst case solar illumination. For frequencies 4, 10, and\n15 GHz, the nighttime values indicate sensitivity losses of 1, 10 and 20\npercent, respectively. The ATA.s exceptional wide-bandwidth permits\nobservations over a continuous range 0.5 to 11.2 GHz, and future retrofits may\nincrease this range to 15 GHz. Beam patterns show a slowly varying focus\nfrequency dependence. We probe the antenna optical gain and beam pattern\nstability as a function of focus and observation frequency, concluding that ATA\ncan produce high fidelity images over a decade of simultaneous observation\nfrequencies.

The spectral and amplitude tunability of these polarimetric\nparameters through the aspect ratios to span from the minimum to maximum ([0,\n1] in the case of diattenuation and [0, {\\pi}] in the case of retardance)\npresents a novel result that could be used to tailor systems for study of\nbiological media.

It is highly probable that this cluster environment influenced\nvarious properties of the solar system like its chemical composition, size and\nthe orbital parameters of some of its constituting bodies. In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Using\nthe now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is\ndemonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first\n5Myr are so high (initially > 10^5 Msun pc^{-3}) that hardly any discs with\nsolar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes a\nstarburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar\nsystem. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky\ncluster (often classified as OB association). It is demonstrated that an\nencounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar\nsystems most likely happened very early on (< 2Myr) in its formation history\nand that after 5Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an\nencounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the\nbound remnant. This explains why the solar system could develop and maintain\nits high circularity later in its development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2012 07:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

One\ncan formally prove that the program is correct, but this may be beyond the\npower of existing methods. Alternatively one can check that the output produced\nfor a particular input satisfies the desired input-output relation, by running\na checker on the input-output pair. Then one only needs to prove the\ncorrectness of the checker. But for some problems even such a checker may be\ntoo complicated to formally verify. There is a third alternative: augment the\noriginal program to produce not only an output but also a correctness\ncertificate, with the property that a very simple program (whose correctness is\neasy to prove) can use the certificate to verify that the input-output pair\nsatisfies the desired input-output relation.\n  We consider the following important instance of this general question: How\ndoes one verify that the dominator tree of a flow graph is correct? Existing\nfast algorithms for finding dominators are complicated, and even verifying the\ncorrectness of a dominator tree in the absence of additional information seems\ncomplicated. We define a correctness certificate for a dominator tree, show how\nto use it to easily verify the correctness of the tree, and show how to augment\nfast dominator-finding algorithms so that they produce a correctness\ncertificate. We also relate the dominator certificate problem to the problem of\nfinding independent spanning trees in a flow graph, and we develop algorithms\nto find such trees.

We present the first numerical evidence for\nthis scenario using a suite of self-consistent hydrodynamic simulations of a\n2.3e11 Msun galactic halo, in which we investigate the correlations between the\ndisk stellar/gas surface densities and the spin parameter of its host halo. A\nclear anti-correlation between the surface densities and the halo spin\nparameter, lambda, is found. That is, as the halo spin parameter increases, the\ndisk cutoff radius at which the stellar surface density drops below 0.1\nMsun/pc^2 monotonically increases, while the average stellar surface density of\nthe disk within that radius decreases. The ratio of the average stellar surface\ndensity for the case of lambda=0.03 to that for the case of lambda=0.14 reaches\nmore than 15. We demonstrate that the result is robust against variations in\nthe baryon fraction, confirming that the angular momentum of the host halo is\nan important driver for the formation of LSBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2012 13:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 06:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2013 01:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

Starting from the adiabatic\nconnection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, an exact expression for the\nelectronic exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate that the pairwise\ninteratomic dispersion energy for an arbitrary collection of isotropic\npolarizable dipoles emerges from the second-order expansion of the ACFD\nformula. Moreover, for a system of quantum harmonic oscillators coupled through\na dipole--dipole potential, we prove the equivalence between the full\ninteraction energy obtained from the Hamiltonian diagonalization and the ACFD\ncorrelation energy in the random-phase approximation. This property makes the\nHamiltonian diagonalization an efficient method for the calculation of the\nmany-body dispersion energy. In addition, we show that the switching function\nused to damp the dispersion interaction at short distances arises from a\nshort-range screened Coulomb potential, whose role is to account for the\nspatial spread of the individual atomic dipole moments. By using the ACFD\nformula we gain a deeper understanding of the approximations made in the\ninteratomic pairwise approaches, providing a powerful formalism for further\ndevelopment of accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of the\ndispersion energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2012 14:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}
