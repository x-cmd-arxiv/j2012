My conclusion is that there is little or no evidence for\nsuch objects.\n  Panchromatic properties of all types of radio loud AGN are then reviewed in\ndetail. Radio galaxies usually show subparsec-scale radio core sources, jets,\nand a pair of giant radio lobes. The optical spectra sometimes show only\nrelatively weak lines of low-ionization ionic species, and no clear nuclear\ncontinuum in the optical or UV region of the spectrum. Some show strong\nhigh-ionization narrow lines. Finally, a few radio galaxies add broad bases\nonto the permitted lines. These spectral categories are the same as those for\nradio-quiet AGN and quasars.\n  By the 1980s, data from optical polarization and statistics of the radio\nproperties required that many narrow line radio galaxies do in fact produce\nstrong optical/UV continuum. This continuum and the broad line emission are\nhidden from the line of sight by dusty, roughly toroidal gas distributions, but\nthey are seen in polarized flux. The radio galaxies with hidden quasars are\nreferred to as \"thermal.\"\n  Do all radio galaxies harbor hidden quasars? We now know the answer using the\nradio, infrared, optical and X-ray properties. Near the top of the radio\nluminosity function, for FRII, GPS, and CSS galaxies, the answer is yes. At\nsomewhat lower luminosities, many do not. At the lowest radio luminosities,\nmost do not. Instead these \"nonthermal\" weakly-accreting galaxies manifest\ntheir energetic output only as kinetic energy in the form of synchrotron jets.\nThis applies to all types of radio galaxies, big FR II doubles, as well as the\nsmall young GPS and CSS sources. Only a few FR I sources are of the thermal\ntype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 18:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-11"}

Standard approaches to the\ncomputation problem separate computation from communication: quantized sensor\nreadings are transmitted interference-free to a fusion center that reconstructs\neach sensor reading and subsequently computes the sought function value. Such\nseparation-based computation schemes are generally highly inefficient as a\ncomplete reconstruction of individual sensor readings is not necessary for the\nfusion center to compute a function of them. In particular, if the mathematical\nstructure of the wireless channel is suitably matched (in some sense) to the\nfunction, then channel collisions induced by concurrent transmissions of\ndifferent nodes can be beneficially exploited for computation purposes.\nTherefore, in this paper a practically relevant analog computation scheme is\nproposed that allows for an efficient estimate of linear and nonlinear\nfunctions over the wireless multiple-access channel.

This method may be viewed as subspace iteration\ncombined with a model reduction procedure. Specifically, starting with a test\nsolution, the method solves a reduced model to obtain a more precise solution,\nand it repeats this process until sufficient accuracy is achieved. The reduced\nmodel is obtained by projecting the full model onto a subspace that is spanned\nby the dominant modes of an extended data ensemble. The learning procedure is\ncomputed in the online stage, as opposed to being computed offline, which is\nused in many projection-based model reduction techniques that require prior\ncalculations or experiments. After providing an error bound of the classical\nPOD-Galerkin method in terms of the projection error and the initial condition\nerror, we prove that the sequence of approximate solutions converge to the\nactual solution of the original system as long as the vector field of the full\nmodel is locally Lipschitz on an open set that contains the solution\ntrajectory. Good accuracy of the proposed method has been demonstrated in two\nnumerical examples, from a linear advection-diffusion equation to a nonlinear\nBurgers equation. In order to save computational cost, the SIRM method is\nextended to a local model reduction approach by partitioning the entire time\ndomain into several subintervals and obtaining a series of local reduced models\nof much lower dimensionality.

Substantial\nexperimental evidence has since accumulated in favor of this pairing symmetry,\nincluding several interesting recent results related to broken time reversal\nsymmetry and vortices with half of the usual superconducting flux quantum.\nGreat interest surrounds the possibility of chiral p-wave order in Sr2RuO4,\nsince this state may exhibit topological order analogous to that of a quantum\nHall state, and can support such exotic physics as Majorana fermions and\nnon-Abelian winding statistics, which have been proposed as one route to a\nquantum computer. However, serious discrepancies remain in trying to connect\nthe experimental results to theoretical predictions for chiral p-wave order. In\nthis paper, I review a broad range of experiments on Sr2RuO4 that are sensitive\nto p-wave pairing, triplet superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking and compare these experiments to each other and to theoretical\npredictions. In this context, the evidence for triplet pairing is strong,\nalthough some puzzles remain. The \"smoking gun\" experimental results for chiral\np-wave, those which directly look for evidence of broken time-reversal symmetry\nin the superconducting state of Sr2RuO4, are most perplexing when the results\nare compared to each other and to theoretical predictions. Consequently, the\ncase for chiral p-wave in Sr2RuO4 remains unresolved, suggesting the need to\nconsider either significant modifications to the standard chiral p-wave models\nor possible alternative pairing symmetries.

The model applies to the description of a planar array of optical\nfibers, or of a stack of parallel planar waveguides, in the temporal and\nspatial domains, respectively, as well as to the self-attractive Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) loaded into an array of parallel tunnel-coupled cigar-shaped\ntraps. It was found previously that the interplay of the group-velocity\ndispersion, discrete diffraction (in the longitudinal and transverse\ndirections, respectively) and intrinsic self-focusing gives rise to SDSs in the\narray. We here develop the variational approximation (VA) and additional\nanalytical methods for the description of the SDSs, and study their mobility\nand collisions by means of systematic simulations. The VA and an exact solution\nof the linearized equation in the cores adjacent to the central one produce an\naccurate description for the family of stable fundamental onsite-centered SDS\nsolutions, as well of surface SDSs in the semi-infinite array. The VA is also\npresented for transversely unstable intersite-centered solitons. In\nsimulations, the solitons are not mobile in the discrete direction (non-soliton\nsemi-discrete modes may be mobile across the array). Collisions between SDSs\ntraveling in the longitudinal direction feature a threshold separating the\npassage and merger or destruction. The exact shape of the threshold, considered\nas a function of the solitons' energy, features irregularities, while its\naverage form is explained analytically. \"Shifted\" collisions between SDSs\ncentered at adjacent cores are studied too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 18:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We present a\nstudy of the nanometer scale disorder of single crystal cryogenically cleaved\nsamples of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x whose dopings range from p = 0.19 to 0.06. The\nphenomenological model used is the Tripartite model that has been successfully\napplied to the average LDOS(E) previously. The resulting energy scale maps show\na structured patchwork disorder of three energy scales, which can be described\nby a single underlying disordered parameter. This spatial disorder structure is\nuniversal for all dopings and energy scales. It is independent of the oxygen\ndopant negative energy resonances and the interface between the different\npatches takes the form of a shortened lifetime pseudogap/superconducting gap\nstate. The relationship between the energy scales and the spatial modulations\nof the dispersive QPI, static q1* modulation and the pseudogap shows that the\nenergy scales signatures in the LDOS(E) are tied to the onset and termination\nof the spatial excitations. The static q1* modulations local energy range is\nmeasured and its signature in the LDOS(E) is the kink, whose number of states\nare modulated with a wave vector of q1*.

Direct evidence for highly-ionized, Compton-thin inner-disk\nwinds comes from observations of blueshifted (v~0.05-0.1c) iron-K X-ray\nabsorption lines. However, it has been suggested that the inner regions of\nblack hole accretion disks can also drive Compton-thick winds --- such winds\nwould enshroud the inner disk, preventing us from seeing direct signatures of\nthe accretion disk (i.e. the photospheric thermal emission, or the\nDoppler/gravitationally broadened iron K-alpha line). Here, we show that,\nprovided the source is sub-Eddington, the well-established wind driving\nmechanisms fail to launch a Compton-thick wind from the inner disk. For the\naccelerated region of the wind to be Compton-thick, the momentum carried in the\nwind must exceed the available photon momentum by a factor of at least\n2/lambda, where lambda is the Eddington ratio of the source, ruling out\nradiative acceleration unless the source is very close to the Eddington limit.\nCompton-thick winds also carry large mass-fluxes, and a consideration of the\nconnections between the wind and the disk show this to be incompatible with\nmagneto-centrifugal driving. Finally, thermal driving of the wind is ruled out\non the basis of the large Compton-radii that typify black hole systems. In the\nabsence of some new acceleration mechanism, we conclude that the inner regions\nof sub-Eddington accretion disks around black holes are indeed naked.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

These theories\ngenerally include a potential V(phi) which is a function of the scalar field\nphi. Although V(phi) can be represented by a very diverse set of functions,\nrecent work has shown the under some conditions, such as the slow roll\nconditions, the equation of state parameter w is either independent of the form\nof V(phi) or is part of family of solutions with only a few parameters.

We find that the limit on the variation of\nmu puts significant constraints on the product of a cosmological parameter w+1\ntimes a new physics parameter zeta_mu^2, the coupling constant between mu and\nthe rolling scalar field. Even when the cosmologies are restricted to very slow\nroll conditions either the value of zeta_mu must be at the lower end of or less\nthan its expected values or the value of w+1 must be restricted to values\nvanishingly close to 0. This implies that either the rolling scalar field is\nvery weakly coupled with the electromagnetic field, small zeta_mu, very weakly\ncoupled with gravity, w+1 ~ 0 or both. These results stress that adherence to\nthe measured invariance in mu is a very significant test of the validity of any\nproposed cosmology and any new physics it requires.

Observationally such events are dominated\nby hydrogen deficient progenitors and classified as Type I supernovae: white\ndwarf thermonuclear explosions (Type Ia) and core collapses of\nhydrogen-stripped massive stars (Type Ibc). Transient surveys are finding SNe I\nin increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to be\nstudied in unprecedented detail. Motivated by these developments, we summarize\nthe physics that produces their rising lightcurves and discuss how observations\ncan be utilized to study these exploding stars. The early radioactive-powered\nlightcurves probe the shallowest 56Ni deposits. If the amount of 56Ni mixing\ncan be deduced, then it places constraints on the progenitor and properties of\nthe explosive burning. In practice we find it is difficult to disentangle\nwhether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing 56Ni heating near the\nsurface or whether the explosion began in the past and 56Ni heating is deeper.\nIn the latter case there is a \"dark phase\" between the moment of explosion and\nthe first light observed from the shallowest layers of 56Ni. Because of this,\nsimply extrapolating a lightcurve from 56Ni back in time is not a reliable\nmethod for estimating the explosion time. The best solution is to directly\nidentify the moment of explosion, by either observing shock breakout or\nshock-heated surface cooling, so the depth being probed by the rising\nlightcurve is known. Since this is typically not available, we identify other\ndiagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosion\noccurred. As an example we apply these arguments to the SN Ic PTF 10vgv. We\ndemonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity and\ntemperature during the rise places constraints on its explosion time, radius,\nand 56Ni mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In this Letter, we study\nthe late formation stage of such second-generation stars, where a large amount\nof gas accretes onto the protostar and the final stellar mass is determined\nwhen the accretion terminates. We directly compute the complex interplay\nbetween the accretion flow and stellar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, performing\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulations coupled with stellar evolution calculations.\nBecause of more efficient H2 and HD cooling in the pre-stellar stage, the\naccretion rates onto the star are ten times lower than in the case of the\nformation of the first stars. The lower accretion rates and envelope density\nresult in the occurrence of an expanding bipolar HII region at a lower\nprotostellar mass M_* \\simeq 10Msun, which blows out the circumstellar\nmaterial, thereby quenching the mass supply from the envelope to the accretion\ndisk. At the same time the disk loses mass due to photoevaporation by the\ngrowing star. In our fiducial case the stellar UV feedback terminates mass\naccretion onto the star at M_* \\simeq 17Msun. Although the derived masses of\nthe second-generation primordial stars are systematically lower than those of\nthe first generation, the difference is within a factor of only a few.

However, investigating the\nasphericity of galaxy clusters is still in its infancy. We review here this\ntopic which is currently gathering a growing interest from the cluster\ncommunity. We begin by introducing the triaxial geometry. Then we discuss the\ntopic of deprojection and demonstrate the need for combining different probes\nof the cluster's potential. We discuss the different works that have been\naddressing these issues. We present a general parametric framework intended to\nsimultaneously fit complementary data sets (X-ray, Sunyaev Zel'dovich and\nlensing data).

We argue that a triaxial model generally allows to\nlower the inferred value of the concentration parameter compared to a spherical\nanalysis. This may alleviate tensions regarding, e.g. the over-concentration\nproblem. However, we stress that predictions from numerical simulations rely on\na spherical analysis of triaxial halos. Given that triaxial analysis will have\na growing importance in the observational side, we advocate the need for\nsimulations to be analysed in the very same way, allowing reliable and\nmeaningful comparisons.

The key feature of this algorithm is a new, computationally\nefficient Poisson solver for the sphere that combines spherical harmonic\ntransform and multgrid methods. As a result, large areas of sky (~10, 000\nsquare degrees) can be ray traced efficiently at high-resolution using only a\nfew hundred cores on widely available machines.

We obtain ground states for this \"two-circle\" potential that display\nlarge void regions in the disordered regime. As more degrees of freedom are\nconstrained the ground states exhibit a collapse of dimensionality\ncharacterized by the emergence of filamentary structures and linear chains.\nThis collapse of dimensionality has not been observed before in related\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 21:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

If this\nscenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of\nstrong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO,\nVirgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search. For NS-NS systems, a jet angle of 20 degrees, a\ngamma-ray satellite field of view of 10% of the sky, and priors with generally\nprecessing spin, this doubles the number of NS-NS short-GRB and NS-BH short-GRB\nassociations, to ~3-4% of all detections of NS-NSs and NS-BHs. We also\ninvestigate the power of tests for statistical excesses in lists of\nsubthreshold events, and show that these are unlikely to reveal a subthreshold\npopulation until finding GW associations to short GRBs is already routine.\nFinally, we provide useful formulas for calculating the prior distribution of\nGW amplitudes from a compact binary coalescence, for a given GW detector\nnetwork and given sky location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 00:29:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 17:53:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 23:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 11:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-26"}

One approach to this question is\nthe study of relative velocities. In this context, a non local test particle is\n\"superluminal\" if its relative velocity exceeds the local speed of light of the\nobserver. The existence of superluminal relative velocities of receding test\nparticles, in a particular cosmological model, suggests itself as a possible\ncriterion for expansion of space in that model. In this point of view,\nsuperluminal velocities of distant receding galaxy clusters result from the\nexpansion of space between the observer and the clusters. However, there is a\nfundamental ambiguity that must be resolved before this approach can be\nmeaningful. The notion of relative velocity of a nonlocal object depends on the\nchoice of coordinates, and this ambiguity suggests the need for coordinate\nindependent definitions. In this work, we review four (inequivalent)\ngeometrically defined and universal notions of relative velocity: Fermi,\nkinematic, astrometric, and spectroscopic relative velocities.

Consequently the thermal B-factor fluctuations are very small,\nwhich is an advantage in our construction. The energy function that we utilize\nresembles that of the discrete non-linear Schrodinger equation. Likewise, ours\nsupports solitons as local minimum energy configurations. We describe the 1ABS\nbackbone in terms of solitons with a precision that deviates from 1ABS by an\naverage root-mean-square distance, which is less than the experimentally\nobserved Debye-Waller B-factor fluctuation distance.

The proof is accomplished by\nexploring the properties of relative entropy in the context of hypothesis\ntesting via one-way LOCC operations, and by making use of an argument\nresembling that by Piani on the faithfulness of regularized relative entropy of\nentanglement.\n  Following this, we obtain a commensurate and faithful lower bound for\nsquashed entanglement, in the form of one-way LOCC relative entropy of\nentanglement.

It appears after the spontaneous\nbreaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which was proposed to solve the\nstrong-CP problem. Other pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, postulated in some\nextensions of the standard model of particle physics, are called axion-like\nparticles (ALPs) if they share certain characteristics with the axion, in\nparticular a coupling to two photons. Thus far, axion and ALP searches have\nbeen unsuccessful, indicating that their couplings have to be extremely weak.\nHowever, axions and ALPs could be responsible for some observable effects in\nastrophysics and cosmology, which can also be exploited to constrain the\nparameter space of these particles. We focus on limits coming from cosmology,\nwhich is an optimal field for studying axions and ALPs. In particular, we first\ninvestigate the possibility of a primordial population of axions and ALPs\narising during the earliest epochs of the universe. The importance of this\nanalysis lies on the fact that axions and ALPs are ideal dark matter candidates\nbecause of their faint interactions and their peculiar production mechanisms.\nFinally, we consider the consequences of the decay of such a population on\nspecific cosmological observables, namely the photon spectrum of galaxies, the\ncosmic microwave background, the effective number of neutrino species, and the\nabundance of primordial elements. Our bounds constitute the most stringent\nprobes of early decays and exclude a part of the ALP parameter space that is\notherwise very difficult to test experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 12:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-12"}

As new keys arrive it may be necessary\nto change the labels of some items; such changes may be done at any time at\nunit cost for each change. The goal is to minimize the total cost. An\nalternative formulation of this problem is the file maintenance problem, in\nwhich the items, instead of being labeled, are maintained in sorted order in an\narray of length m, and we pay unit cost for moving an item.\n  For the case m=cn for constant c>1, there are known algorithms that use at\nmost O(n log(n)^2) relabelings in total [Itai, Konheim, Rodeh, 1981], and it\nwas shown recently that this is asymptotically optimal [Bul\\'anek, Kouck\\'y,\nSaks, 2012]. For the case of m={\\Theta}(n^C) for C>1, algorithms are known that\nuse O(n log n) relabelings. A matching lower bound was claimed in [Dietz,\nSeiferas, Zhang, 2004]. That proof involved two distinct steps: a lower bound\nfor a problem they call prefix bucketing and a reduction from prefix bucketing\nto online labeling. The reduction seems to be incorrect, leaving a (seemingly\nsignificant) gap in the proof. In this paper we close the gap by presenting a\ncorrect reduction to prefix bucketing. Furthermore we give a simplified and\nimproved analysis of the prefix bucketing lower bound. This improvement allows\nus to extend the lower bounds for online labeling to the case where the number\nm of labels is superpolynomial in n. In particular, for superpolynomial m we\nget an asymptotically optimal lower bound {\\Omega}((n log n) / (log log m - log\nlog n)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 12:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-12"}

The model is introduced by means of an analogy between the\nadiabatic quantum computation and an inelastic atomic collision. By means of a\nsimple two-state model, several quantum gates are reproduced, concluding the\npossibility of diabatic universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. Going a\nstep further, a new quantum diabatic computation model is glimpsed, where a\ncarefully chosen Hamiltonian could carry out a non-adiabatic transition between\nthe initial and the sought final state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 12:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-12"}

We compare its chromospheric activity level with a\nmodel of chrosmospheric activity evolution established by combining\nrelationships between the R'HK index and the Rossby number with a recent model\nof stellar rotation evolution on the main sequence. We measure the spot\ncoverage of the stellar surface as a function of time, and find evidence for a\ntentative increase from 5-14% at the beginning of the observing run to 13-29%\n35 days later. A high level of magnetic activity on CoRoT102899501 is\ncorroborated by a strong emission in the Balmer and Ca II HK lines (logR'HK ~\n-4). The starspots used as tracers of the star rotation constrain the rotation\nperiod to 1.625+/-0.002 days and do not show evidence for differential\nrotation. The effective temperature (Teff=5180+/-80 K), surface gravity\n(logg=4.35+/-0.1), and metallicity ([M/H]=0.05+/-0.07 dex) indicate that the\nobject is located near the evolutionary track of a 1.09+/-0.12 M_Sun pre-main\nsequence star at an age of 23+/-10 Myrs. This value is consistent with the\n\"gyro-age\" of about 8-25 Myrs, inferred using a parameterization of the stellar\nrotation period as a function of colour index and time established for the\nI-sequence of stars in stellar clusters.

We first show\nthat the stability of both transverse modes (ripples) and of small wavelength\ninclined modes (bars) predicted by the Saint-Venant approach are artefacts of\nthis hydrodynamical approximation. When using a more reliable hydrodynamical\nmodel, the dispersion relation does not present any maximum of the growth rate\nwhen the sediment transport is assumed to be locally saturated. The analysis\ntherefore reveals the fundamental importance of the relaxation of sediment\ntransport towards equilibrium as it it is responsible for the stabilisation of\nsmall wavelength modes. This dynamical mechanism is characterised by the\nsaturation number, defined as the ratio of the saturation length to the water\ndepth Lsat/H. This dimensionless number controls the transition from ripples\n(transverse patterns) at small Lsat/H to bars (inclined patterns) at large\nLsat/H.

We show that the flux periodicity of the\nJosephson current provides signatures of the topological phase transition and\nthe emergence of Majorana fermions situated on both sides of the weak link even\nwhen fermion parity is not a good quantum number. In large rings, the Majorana\nfermions hybridize only across the weak link.

In mesoscopic\nrings, the Majorana fermions also hybridize through their overlap in the\ninterior of the superconducting ring.

We study fluctuation dynamo\naction in turbulent systems focusing on one observational signature; the\nFaraday rotation measure (RM) from background radio sources seen through the\nmagnetic field generated by such a dynamo. We simulate the fluctuation dynamo\n(FD) in periodic boxes up to resolutions of 512^3, with varying fluid and\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers, and measure the resulting random RMs. We show that,\neven though the magnetic field generated is intermittent, it still allows for\ncontributions to the RM to be significant.

This level of RM dispersion obtains across different\nvalues of magnetic Reynolds number and Prandtl number explored. We also use the\nrandom RMs to probe the structure of the generated fields to distinguish the\ncontribution from intense and diffuse field regions. We find that the strong\nfield regions (say with B > 2B_rms) contribute only of order 15%-20% to the RM.\nThus rare structures do not dominate the RM; rather the general 'sea' of volume\nfilling fluctuating fields are the dominant contributors. We also show that the\nmagnetic integral scale, L_{int}, which is directly related to the RM\ndispersion, increases in all the runs, as Lorentz forces become important to\nsaturate the dynamo. It appears that due to the ordering effect of the Lorentz\nforces, L_{int} of the saturated field tends to a modest fraction, 1/2-1/3 of\nthe integral scale of the velocity field, for all our runs.

Their depth remains unclear but they are thought to be\nconfined to the very outer envelopes where hydrogen remains molecular and the\nelectrical conductivity is small. The dynamo maintaining the dipole-dominated\nmagnetic fields of both gas giants likely operates in the deeper interior where\nhydrogen assumes a metallic state. Here, we present numerical simulations that\nattempt to model both the zonal winds and the interior dynamo action in an\nintegrated approach. Using the anelastic version of the MHD code MagIC, we\nexplore the effects of density stratification and radial electrical\nconductivity variation. The electrical conductivity is mostly assumed to remain\nconstant in the thicker inner metallic region and it decays exponentially\ntowards the outer boundary throughout the molecular envelope. Our results show\nthat the combination of stronger density stratification and weaker conducting\nouter layer is essential for reconciling dipole dominated dynamo action and a\nfierce equatorial zonal jet. Previous simulations with homogeneous electrical\nconductivity show that both are merely exclusive, with solutions either having\nstrong zonal winds and multipolar magnetic fields or weak zonal winds and\ndipole-dominated magnetic fields. All jets tend to be geostrophic and therefore\nreach right through the convective shell in our simulations. The particular\nsetup explored here allows a strong equatorial jet to remain confined to the\nweaker conducting outer region where it does not interfere with the deeper\nseated dynamo action. The flanking mid to high latitude jets, on the other\nhand, have to remain faint to yield a strongly dipolar magnetic field. The\nfiercer jets on Jupiter and Saturn only seem compatible with the observed\ndipolar fields when they remain confined to a weaker conducting outer layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 14:12:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 11:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 14:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 May 2013 08:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2013 13:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-27"}

Using the IRAM 30m telescope, we detected HCN, HCO+, 12CO, and\n13CO in six GMCs along the major axis of M33 at a resolution of ~ 114pc and out\nto a radial distance of 3.4kpc. Optical, far-infrared, and submillimeter data\nfrom Herschel and other observatories complement these observations. To\ninterpret the observed molecular line emission, we created two grids of models\nof photon-dominated regions, one for solar and one for M33-type subsolar\nmetallicity. The observed HCO+/HCN line ratios range between 1.1 and 2.5.\nSimilarly high ratios have been observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The\nHCN/CO ratio varies between 0.4% and 2.9% in the disk of M33. The 12CO/13CO\nline ratio varies between 9 and 15 similar to variations found in the diffuse\ngas and the centers of GMCs of the Milky Way. Stacking of all spectra allowed\nHNC and C2H to be detected. The resulting HCO+/HNC and HCN/HNC ratios of ~ 8\nand 6, respectively, lie at the high end of ratios observed in a large set of\n(ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. HCN abundances are lower in the subsolar\nmetallicity PDR models, while HCO+ abundances are enhanced. For HCN this effect\nis more pronounced at low optical extinctions. The observed HCO+/HCN and HCN/CO\nline ratios are naturally explained by subsolar PDR models of low optical\nextinctions between 4 and 10 mag and of moderate densities of n = 3x10^3 -\n3x10^4 cm^-3, while the FUV field strength only has a small effect on the\nmodeled line ratios. The line ratios are almost equally well reproduced by the\nsolar-metallicity models, indicating that variations in metallicity only play a\nminor role in influencing these line ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 15:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2012 22:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 16:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2013 12:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Several approaches have been proposed that either (i) partition the\nwhole network into clusters, even in low density region, or (ii) are aimed at\nfinding a single densest community (and need to be iterated to find the next\none). As social networks grow larger both approaches (i) and (ii) result in\nalgorithms too slow to be practical, in particular when speed in analyzing the\ndata is required. In this paper we propose an approach that aims at balancing\nefficiency of computation and expressiveness and manageability of the output\ncommunity representation. We define the notion of a partial dense cover (PDC)\nof a graph. Intuitively a PDC of a graph is a collection of sets of nodes that\n(a) each set forms a disjoint dense induced subgraphs and (b) its removal\nleaves the residual graph without dense regions. Exact computation of PDC is an\nNP-complete problem, thus, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithms for\ncomputing a PDC which we christen Core and Peel. Moreover we propose a novel\nbenchmarking technique that allows us to evaluate algorithms for computing PDC\nusing the classical IR concepts of precision and recall even without a golden\nstandard. Tests on 25 social and technological networks from the Stanford Large\nNetwork Dataset Collection confirm that Core and Peel is efficient and attains\nvery high precison and recall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 15:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-12"}

Of all CMB measurements that the scientific\ncommunity has not yet been able to perform, the CMB B-mode polarization is\nprobably the most challenging from the instrumental point of view. The\nsignature of primordial gravitational waves, which give rise to a B-type\npolarization, is one of the goals in cosmology today and amongst the first\nobjectives in the field. For this purpose, high-performance low-temperature\nbolometric cameras, made of thousands of pixels, are currently being developed\nby many groups, which will improve the sensitivity to B-mode CMB polarization\nby one or two orders of magnitude compared to the Planck satellite HFI\ndetectors. We present here a new bolometer structure that is able to increase\nthe pixel sensitivities and to simplify the fabrication procedure. This\ninnovative device replaces delicate membrane-based structures and eliminates\nthe mediation of phonons: the incoming energy is directly captured and measured\nin the electron bath of an appropriate sensor and the thermal decoupling is\nachieved via the intrinsic electron-phonon decoupling of the sensor at very low\ntemperature. Reported results come from a 204-pixel array of Nb$_{x}$Si$_{1-x}$\ntransition edge sensors with a meander structure fabricated on a 2-inch silicon\nwafer using electron-beam co-evaporation and a cleanroom lithography process.\nTo validate the application of this device to CMB measurements, we have\nperformed an optical calibration of our sample in the focal plane of a dilution\ncryostat test bench. We have demonstrated a light absorption close to 20% and\nan NEP of about 7$\\times10^{-16}$ W/$\\sqrt{Hz}$, which is highly encouraging\ngiven the scope for improvement in this type of detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 15:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-08"}

Quantitatively, distances enter into the\nso-called gravity models that successfully predict the weight of non-zero trade\nflows. However, it has been recently shown that gravity models fail to\nreproduce the binary topology of the World Trade Web. In this paper a different\napproach is presented: the formalism of exponential random graphs is used and\nthe distances are treated as constraints, to be imposed on a previously chosen\nensemble of graphs. Then, the information encoded in the geographical distances\nis used to explain the binary structure of the World Trade Web, by testing it\non the degree-degree correlations and the reciprocity structure. This leads to\nthe definition of a novel null model that combines spatial and non-spatial\neffects. The effectiveness of spatial constraints is compared to that of\nnonspatial ones by means of the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion. Even if it is commonly believed that the World Trade Web\nis strongly dependent on the distances, what emerges from our analysis is that\ndistances do not play a crucial role in shaping the World Trade Web binary\nstructure and that the information encoded into the reciprocity is far more\nuseful in explaining the observed patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 15:23:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2012 15:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

This phenomenon is known as\nquantum criticality and leads to fascinating responses in thermodynamics and\ntransport of the compound. In the standard picture, a single quantum critical\npoint occurs at zero temperature, which results in a nontrivial critical\nbehaviour in its vicinity. Here we show that in two dimensions the scenario is\nconsiderably more complex due to the enormous amount of quantum fluctuations.\nInstead of the single point separating the antiferromagnet from the normal\nmetal, we have discovered a broad region between these two phases where the\nmagnetic order is destroyed but certain areas of the Fermi surface are closed\nby a large gap. This gap reflects the formation of a novel quantum state\ncharacterised by a superposition of d-wave superconductivity and a\nquadrupole-density wave, id est a state in which an electron quadrupole density\nspatially oscillates with a period drastically different from the one of the\noriginal spin-density wave. At moderate temperatures both orders co-exist at\nshort distances but thermal fluctuations destroy the long-range order. Below a\ncritical temperature the fluctuations are less essential and superconductivity\nbecomes stable. This new phenomenon may shed some light on the origin of the\nmysterious pseudogap state and of the high-temperature transition into the\nsuperconducting state in cuprates. Our results demonstrate that quantum phase\ntransitions between antiferromagnets and normal metals in layered materials may\nbe the proper playground for search of new high temperature superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 15:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2013 20:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-04"}

Efficient\ncentralized algorithms exists to compute all cases, when the full knowledge of\nthe network evolution is given.\n  In this paper, we study the {\\em distributed} counterparts of these problems,\ni.e. shortest, fastest, and foremost broadcast with termination detection\n(TDB), with minimal knowledge on the topology.\n  We show that the feasibility of each of these problems requires distinct\nfeatures on the evolution, through identifying three classes of dynamic graphs\nwherein the problems become gradually feasible: graphs in which the\nre-appearance of edges is {\\em recurrent} (class R), {\\em bounded-recurrent}\n(B), or {\\em periodic} (P), together with specific knowledge that are\nrespectively $n$ (the number of nodes), $\\Delta$ (a bound on the recurrence\ntime), and $p$ (the period).

LTL is not expressive\nenough to formalize the correctness of reactive systems with respect to some\nquantitative aspects. This paper extends the qualitative LTL synthesis setting\nto a quantitative setting. The alphabet of actions is extended with a weight\nfunction ranging over the rational numbers. The value of an infinite word is\nthe mean-payoff of the weights of its letters. The synthesis problem then\namounts to automatically construct (if possible) a reactive system whose\nexecutions all satisfy a given LTL formula and have mean-payoff values greater\nthan or equal to some given threshold. The latter problem is called LTLMP\nsynthesis and the LTLMP realizability problem asks to check whether such a\nsystem exists. We first show that LTLMP realizability is not more difficult\nthan LTL realizability: it is 2ExpTime-Complete. This is done by reduction to\ntwo-player mean-payoff parity games. While infinite memory strategies are\nrequired to realize LTLMP specifications in general, we show that\nepsilon-optimality can be obtained with finite memory strategies, for any\nepsilon > 0. To obtain an efficient algorithm in practice, we define a\nSafraless procedure to decide whether there exists a finite-memory strategy\nthat realizes a given specification for some given threshold. This procedure is\nbased on a reduction to two-player energy safety games which are in turn\nreduced to safety games. Finally, we show that those safety games can be solved\nefficiently by exploiting the structure of their state spaces and by using\nantichains as a symbolic data-structure. All our results extend to\nmulti-dimensional weights. We have implemented an antichain-based procedure and\nwe report on some promising experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 13:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 11:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2013 08:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-10"}

The total Hilbert space is the tensor product of the two\nspaces $H_{right}\\otimes H_{left}$, where in this case $H_{left/right}$ denotes\nthe physical quantum states space of the closed string .It is shown that closed\nstring states can be represented by a maximally entangled two-mode squeezed\nstate of the left and right spaces of closed string.
