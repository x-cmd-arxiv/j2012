Gravitational\ndarkening is the decrease of the effective temperature near the equator and the\ncorresponding increase near the poles of a star caused by rapid rotation. We\nalso include the rotational distortion of the star using the Roche Model.\nIncreasing the disk density increases the optical depths in the equatorial\nplane, resulting in the formation of an inner cool region near the equatorial\nplane of the disk. High rotation rates result in disks that have temperatures\nsimilar to those of a denser disk, namely cooler overall. However the effect of\nincreasing rotation produces additional heating in the upper disk due to the\nhotter stellar pole. Cool regions in the equatorial plane normally associated\nwith high density are seen in low density models at high rotation rates.\nGravitational darkening increases the amount of very cool and very hot material\nin the disk and decreases the amount of disk material at moderate temperatures.\nWe also present models which study the effect of gravitational darkening on\nhydrostatically-converged disks, in which the temperature structure is\nconsistent with vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Because the equatorial\nregions become cooler, hydrostatically converged models that include gravity\ndarkening have smaller vertical scale heights, and $H/R$ is smaller by as much\nas 56% near $v_{\\rm crit}$.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface\ndensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as\nwith other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star\nformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding\nthis topic.

Finally, we also find that the analogue AB effect and superresonance\nare competing phenomena at a noncommutative spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 17:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 17:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-12"}

For incompressible\nturbulence (Kolmogorov turbulence), we find that the growth rate is\nproportional to the square root of the hydrodynamic Reynolds number, Re^(1/2).\nIn the case of highly compressible turbulence (Burgers turbulence) the growth\nrate increases proportional to Re^(1/3).

The security of these schemes is phrased in\nterms of an extractor which will recover or retrieve the file given any\n\"proving algorithm\" that has a sufficiently high success probability.\n  This paper treats proof-of-retrievability schemes in the model of\nunconditional security, where an adversary has unlimited computational power.\nIn this case retrievability of the file can be modelled as error-correction in\na certain code.

In this paper, we pursue an alternative possibility that dark matter\ngamma lines could arise from \"semi-annihilation\" among multiple dark sector\nstates. The semi-annihilation reaction with a single final state photon is\ntypically enhanced relative to ordinary annihilation into photon pairs.\nSemi-annihilation allows for a wide range of dark matter masses compared to the\nfixed mass value required by annihilation, opening the possibility to explain\npotential dark matter signatures at higher energies. The most striking\nprediction of semi-annihilation is the presence of multiple gamma lines, with\nas many as order N^3 lines possible for N dark sector states, allowing for dark\nsector spectroscopy. A smoking gun signature arises in the simplest case of\ndegenerate dark matter, where a strong semi-annihilation line at 130 GeV would\nbe accompanied by a weaker annihilation line at 173 GeV. As a proof of\nprinciple, we construct two explicit models of dark matter semi-annihilation,\none based on non-Abelian vector dark matter and the other based on retrofitting\nRayleigh dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 20:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 19:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This behavior, which signifies the falling out of equilibrium of\nthe 2DES as T->0, is observed for n_s<n_g (n_g - glass transition density). A\nprotocol where density is changed by a small value \\Delta n_s at low T produces\nthe same results for the noise power spectra. However, a detailed analysis of\nthe non-Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) of the fluctuations\nreveals that \\Delta n_s has a qualitatively different and more dramatic effect\nthan \\Delta T, suggesting that \\Delta n_s induces strong changes in the free\nenergy landscape of the system as a result of Coulomb interactions. The results\nfrom a third, waiting-time (t_w) protocol, where n_s is changed temporarily\nduring t_w by a large amount, demonstrate that non-Gaussian PDFs exhibit\nhistory dependence and an evolution towards a Gaussian distribution as the\nsystem ages and slowly approaches equilibrium.

The case of honeycomb artificial spin ice is similar: its pseudo-ice\nrule, like the ice rule in Pauling and Lieb's systems, simply extends a\ndegeneracy which is already present in the vertices to the global ground state.\nThe anisotropy of the magnetic interaction limits the design of inherently\ndegenerate vertices in artificial spin ice, and the honeycomb is the only\ndegenerate array produced so far. In this paper we show how to engineer\nartificial spin ice in a virtually infinite variety of degenerate geometries\nbuilt out of non-degenerate vertices. In this new class of vertex models, the\nresidual entropy follows not from a freedom of choice at the vertex level, but\nfrom the nontrivial relative arrangement of the vertices themselves.

However, dynamical mechanism\nleading to breakdown of chiral symmetry should be naturally reflected in chiral\nproperties of the modes. Here we offer such connection, presenting evidence\nthat SChSB in QCD proceeds via the appearance of modes exhibiting dynamical\ntendency for local chiral polarization. These modes form a band of finite width\nLambda_ch (chiral polarization scale) around the surface of otherwise\nanti--polarized Dirac sea, and condense. Lambda_ch characterizes the dynamics\nof the breaking phenomenon and can be converted to a quark mass scale, thus\noffering conceptual means to determine which quarks of nature are governed by\nbroken chiral dynamics. It is proposed that, within the context of SU(3) gauge\ntheories with fundamental Dirac quarks, mode condensation is equivalent to\nchiral polarization. This makes Lambda_ch an \"order parameter\" of SChSB, albeit\nwithout local dynamical field representation away from chiral limit. Several\nuses of these features, both at zero and finite temperature, are discussed.

The proof is in two steps:\nfirst the construction of a Birkhoff normal form at a high order, then the\napplication of Nekhoroshev theory. Bounemoura has shown that the second step of\nthis construction remains valid if the Birkhoff normal form linked to an\nelliptic fixed point belongs to a generic set among the formal series. To\nobtain a complete result, we also have to establish that most strongly non\nresonant elliptic fixed point in a Hamiltonian system admit a Birkhoff normal\nform in the set introduced by Bounemoura. We show here that this property is\nsatisfied generically in the sense of the measure (prevalence) through\ninfinite-dimensional probe spaces (that is an infinite number of parameter\nchosen at random) with methods similar to those developed in a paper of\nGorodetski, Kaloshin and Hunt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 22:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The general evolution from hard to soft lags\nas the frequency increases is similar to other AGN where soft lags have been\ndetected. We interpret this soft lag as due to reverberation from the accretion\ndisk, with the reflection component responding to variability from the X-ray\ncorona. For a black hole mass of 7E6 M(solar) this corresponds to a\nlight-crossing time of ~9 R_g/c, however, dilution effects mean that the\nintrinsic lag is likely longer than this. Based on recent black hole\nmass-scaling for lag properties, the lag amplitude and frequency are more\nconsistent with a black hole a few times more massive than the best estimates,\nthough flux-dependent effects could easily add scatter this large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 00:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 15:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Projection of other degrees of\nfreedom onto those dynamic variables using the standard projection operator\nmethod produces essentially two equations which describe the time evolution of\nfluctuation concerning the density field of solvent and the conformation of\nprotein around an equilibrium state, which are coupled with each other. The\nequation concerning the protein dynamics is formally akin to that of the\ncoupled Langevin oscillators, and is a generalization of the latter, to atomic\nlevel.

The bubble is approximated as a\nshort-term impulse delivered to the two fluidic columns inside the channel.\nFluid dynamics is described by a Newton-like equation with a variable mass, but\nwithout the mass derivative term. Because of smaller inertia, the short column\nrefills the channel faster and accumulates a larger mechanical momentum. After\nbubble collapse the total fluid momentum is nonzero, resulting in a net flow.\nTwo different versions of the model are analyzed in detail, analytically and\nnumerically.

Furthermore, our\nanalysis shows that the minimum amount of dissipation required to keep the\ntemperature of the radiation bath above the Hubble rate during inflation is\nlargely independent of the degree of flatness of the potential, although it\ndepends on the field value at the inflection point. We then discuss the\nrelevance of this result to warm inflation model building.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 12:11:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 11:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

Hence, air shower arrays with large underground muon\ndetectors can select a sample greatly enriched in photon showers by rejecting\nshowers containing muons. IceCube is sensitive to muons with energies above\n~500 GeV at the surface, which provides an efficient veto system for hadronic\nair showers with energies above 1 PeV. One year of data from the 40-string\nIceCube configuration was used to perform a search for point sources and a\nGalactic diffuse signal. No sources were found, resulting in a 90% C.L. upper\nlimit on the ratio of gamma rays to cosmic rays of 1.2 x 10^(-3)for the flux\ncoming from the Galactic Plane region (-80 deg < l < -30 deg; -10 deg < b < 5\ndeg) in the energy range 1.2 - 6.0 PeV.

The complete\nIceCube detector will have a better sensitivity, due to the larger detector\nsize, improved reconstruction and vetoing techniques. Preliminary data from the\nnearly-final IceCube detector configuration has been used to estimate the 5\nyear sensitivity of the full detector. It is found to be more than an order of\nmagnitude better, allowing the search for PeV extensions of known TeV gamma-ray\nemitters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 13:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

A weak room-temperature ferromagnetism (FM) has been\ndetected in slightly reduced TiO2 thin film and in other oxides; as these\nmaterials are insulating closed-shell systems, this phenomenon has been\nclassified as \"d0 magnetism\". Since this magnetism could be related to the\ngrowth process and to the presence of defects (oxygen vacancies, VO), an\nanalysis of Ti electronic states (especially of Ti3+ energy levels) is\nmandatory. The first part of this work is devoted to the magnetic\ncharacterization of a set of TiO2 and N-doped TiO2 samples, together with the\nanalysis of Ti 3d-related states carried out with X-ray photoemission (XPS) and\nresonant photoemission (ResPES). The hypothesis of clustered VO as the source\nof FM is then discussed in the light of the experimental and theoretical\nresults. Another interesting oxide system in which the stoichiometry of Ti ions\nplay a fundamental role is the LAO-STO interface. In fact, while LAO and STO\nseparately are two band insulators, the interface created by growing LAO on the\ntop of STO (001) has found to become metallic, hosting a 2D electron gas. The\nsecond part of this Thesis is devoted to the study of conductive and insulating\nLAO-STO interfaces, carried out by XPS, X-ray absorption (XAS) and with ResPES.\nThe sample stoichiometry is evaluated through a comparison with LAO and STO\nsingle crystals. A resonance enhancement of the conductive Ti states,\nassociated to Ti3+ ions, is reported and compared to theoretical calculations.\nOn the basis of these results, the origin of metallic states in ultra-thin\nLAO-STO interfaces is properly addressed. In addition, a characterization of\nthe structural disorder at the interface is shown, carried out with\nangle-resolved XPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 13:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-31"}

As an\napplication, interference patterns of the magnetic type-I Aharonov-Bohm (AB)\neffect are obtained by evolving atoms along a circle over several tens of\nlattice cells. During the evolution, the quantum coherence is maintained and\nthe atoms are exposed to a large magnetic flux. The scheme requires only\nstandard optical access, and is robust to weak particle interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 13:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 21:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In the dilute\nplasmas, the ion Larmor radius is small compared with its collisional mean free\npath. In this case, the transport of heat and momentum along the magnetic field\nlines become important. This paper presents a novel linear instability that may\nmore powerful and greater than ideal magnetothermal instability (MTI) and ideal\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) in the dilute astrophysical plasmas. This\ntype of plasma is believed to be found in the intracluster medium of galaxy\nclusters and radiatively ineffective accretion flows around black holes. We\nderive the dispersion relation of this instability and obtain the instability\ncondition. There is at least one unstable mode that is independent of the\ntemperature gradient direction for a helical magnetic field geometry. This\nnovel instability is driven by the gyroviscosity coupled with differential\nrotation. Therefore we call it as gyroviscous modified magnetorotational\ninstability (GvMRI).

Methods: The IRAM PdBI has been used to study the distribution and\nkinematics of molecular gas in 3C236 by imaging with high spatial resolution\nthe emission of the 12CO(2-1) line in the nucleus of the galaxy. We have\nsearched for outflow signatures in the CO map. We have also derived the SFR in\n3C236 using data available from the literature at UV, optical and IR\nwavelengths, to determine the star-formation efficiency of molecular gas.\nResults: The CO emission in 3C236 comes from a spatially resolved 2.6 kpc disk\nwith a regular rotating pattern. Within the limits imposed by the sensitivity\nand velocity coverage of the CO data, we do not detect any outflow signatures\nin the cold molecular gas. The disk has a cold gas mass M(H2)~2.1x10^9 Msun. We\ndetermine a new value for the redshift of the source zCO=0.09927. The\nsimilarity between the CO and HI profiles indicates that the deep HI absorption\nin 3C236 can be accounted for by a rotating HI structure, restricting the\nevidence of HI outflow to the most extreme velocities. In the light of the new\nredshift, the analysis of the ionized gas kinematics reveals a 1000 km/s\noutflow. As for the CO emitting gas, outflow signatures are nevertheless absent\nin the warm molecular gas emission traced by infrared H2 lines. The\nstar-formation efficiency in 3C236 is consistent with the value measured in\nnormal galaxies, which follow the canonical KS-law. This result, confirmed to\nhold in other young radio sources examined in this work, is in stark contrast\nwith the factor of 10-50 lower SFE that seems to characterize evolved powerful\nradio galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 15:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
