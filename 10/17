To compute the magnetic moments and polarizabilities of charged\nhadrons, for example, one requires sufficiently weak magnetic fields. Such\nfield strengths, however, lead to closely spaced Landau levels that are not\nstraightforwardly resolved using standard lattice spectroscopy. Focusing on\ncharged spinless hadrons, we introduce a simple projection technique that can\nbe used to isolate the lowest Landau level. As the technique requires the\nexplicit coordinate-space wave-function, we investigate the extent to which the\ncontinuum, infinite volume wave-function can be employed. We find that, in\npractice, the effects of discretization can be handled using a perturbative\nexpansion about the continuum. Finite volume corrections are taken into account\nby using the discrete magnetic translational invariance of the torus.

Considering that local interactions\namong individuals generate patterns that -at a large scale- govern the action\nof masses, we have studied the behavioral adaptation of a population induced by\nthe spread of an infectious disease. Therefore, we have developed a rule-based\nmodel of a hypothetical zombie outbreak, written in Kappa language, and\nsimulated using Guillespie's stochastic approach. Our study addresses the\nspecificity and heterogeneity of the system at the individual level, a highly\ndesirable characteristic, mostly overlooked in classic epidemic models.\nTogether with the basic elements of a typical epidemiological model, our model\nincludes an individual representation of the disease progression and the\ntraveling of agents among cities being affected. It also introduces an\napproximation to measure the effect of panic in the population as a function of\nthe individual situational awareness. In addition, the effect of two possible\ncountermeasures to overcome the zombie threat is considered: the availability\nof medical treatment and the deployment of special armed forces. However, due\nto the special characteristics of this hypothetical infectious disease, even\nusing exaggerated numbers of countermeasures, only a small percentage of the\npopulation can be saved at the end of the simulations. As expected from a\nrule-based model approach, the global dynamics of our model resulted primarily\ngoverned by the mechanistic description of local interactions occurring at the\nindividual level.

In order to study CH properties, the author\ndeveloped an automated CH detection method (CHARM), which uses local intensity\nhistograms to identify CH boundaries. An additional algorithm package (CHEVOL)\nwas developed to study individual CHs by tracking their boundary evolution. It\nis widely accepted that the short-term changes in CH boundaries are due to the\ninterchange reconnection between the CH open field lines and small loops. In\norder to test the interchange reconnection model, the magnetic reconnection\nrate and the diffusion coefficient at CH boundaries were determined using\nobserved CH boundary displacement velocities. The results were found to be in\nagreement with those determined by the theory. The MIST algorithm was developed\nby the author to build on the CHARM package, providing a fast and consistent\nway to link CHs to high-speed solar wind periods detected at Earth. This\nallowed us to carry out a long-term analysis (2000-2009) to study the\nrelationship between CHs, the corresponding HSSW properties, and geomagnetic\nindices. The relationship between CH related high-speed solar wind streams and\nthe electron flux enhancements in the Van Allen radiation belt was confirmed.\nThe research presented in this thesis includes the small-scale analysis of\nindividual CHs on time scales of days, which is complemented with large scale\nanalysis of CH groups on time scales of years.

As the hypothesis\npredicts, we find that the time reparametrization fluctuations become\nincreasingly dominant as temperature is lowered and timescales are increased.\nMore specifically, the ratio between the strengths of the transverse\nfluctuations and the longitudinal fluctuations grows as a function of the\ndynamical susceptibility, \\chi 4, which represents the strength of the\ndynamical heterogeneity; and the correlation volumes for the transverse\nfluctuations are approximately proportional to those for the dynamical\nheterogeneity, while the correlation volumes for the longitudinal fluctuations\nremain small and approximately constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 16:38:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 19:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 19:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 20:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-30"}

It turns out that there is essentially a\none-to-one correspondence between such thermodynamic states and probability\nmeasures on CP^{2s}. Let a measure be supported on a set of possibly fractal\nreal dimension d with respect to the Study-Fubini metric of CP^{2s}. Let m be\nthe number of sites in a subsystem of the bipartition. We give evidence that in\nthe limit where m goes to infinity, the entanglement entropy diverges like\n(d/2)log(m). Further, if the measure is supported on a submanifold of CP^{2s}\nand can be described by a density f with respect to the metric induced by the\nStudy-Fubini metric, we give evidence that the correction term is simply\nrelated to the entropy associated to f: the geometric entropy of geometric\nquantum mechanics.

Five different methods\nof randomly sampling over these reaction rate probability distributions are\nthen developed, tested, and compared with the reference nucleosynthesis yields.\n  Results: Given that the reaction rate probability density distributions can\nbe described accurately with a lognormal distribution, Monte Carlo\nnucleosynthesis variations arising from the parametrised estimates for the\nreaction rate variations agree remarkably well with those obtained from the\ntrue rate samples. Most significantly, the most simple parametrisation agrees\nwithin just a few percent, meaning that Monte Carlo nucleosynthesis studies can\nbe performed reliably using lognormal parametrisations of reaction rate\nprobability density functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 17:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The major threat for the service\nproviders is that of fake check-ins. Users can easily manipulate the\nlocalization module of the underlying application and declare their presence in\na counterfeit location. The incentives for these behaviors can be both earning\nmonetary as well as virtual rewards. Therefore, while fake check-ins driven\nfrom the former motive can cause monetary losses, those aiming in virtual\nrewards are also harmful. In particular, they can significantly degrade the\nservices offered from the LBSN providers (such as recommendations) or third\nparties using these data (e.g., urban planners).

We\nconsider both discontinuous and smooth transitions between the radiative and\nconvective regions and derive Green's functions to solve for the IGWs in the\nradiative region. We find that if the radiative-convective transition is\nsmooth, the IGW flux depends on the exact form of the buoyancy frequency near\nthe interface. IGW excitation is most efficient for very smooth interfaces,\nwhich gives an upper bound on the IGW flux of ~ F_conv (d/H), where F_conv is\nthe flux carried by the convective motions, d is the width of the transition\nregion, and H is the pressure scale height. This can be much larger than the\nstandard result in the literature for a discontinuous radiative-convective\ntransition, which gives a wave flux ~ F_conv M$, where M is the convective Mach\nnumber. However, in the smooth transition case, the most efficiently excited\nperturbations will break in the radiative zone.

The halos have X-ray luminosities of Lx~3e44 erg/s and sizes of ~60kpc.\nTheir morphologies are broadly similar to the ~60-kpc long radio lobes around\nthese galaxies suggesting they are formed from IC scattering by relativistic\nelectrons in the radio lobes, of either CMB or FIR photons from the\ndust-obscured starbursts in these galaxies. These observations double the\nnumber of z>3 HzRGs with X-ray detected IC halos. We compare the IC X-ray to\nradio luminosity ratios for these new detections to the two previously detected\nz~3.8 HzRGs. Given the similar redshifts, we would expect comparable X-ray IC\nluminosities if CMB mm photons are the seed field for the IC emission. Instead\nthe two z~3.6 HzRGs, which are ~4x fainter in the FIR, also have ~4x fainter\nX-ray IC emission. Including a further six z>2 radio sources with IC X-ray\nhalos from the literature, we suggest that in the more compact (lobe sizes\n<100-200kpc), majority of radio sources, the bulk of the IC emission may be\ndriven by scattering of locally produced FIR photons from luminous,\ndust-obscured starbursts within these galaxies, rather than CMB photons. The\nresulting X-ray emission can ionise the gas on ~100-200-kpc scales around these\nsystems and thus form their extended Ly-alpha emission line halos.

To verify the algorithm's\nperformance we evaluated 100,000 objects in Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)\nwide-field-survey data for signs of binarity, and then used the Robo-AO robotic\nlaser adaptive optics system to verify the parameters of 44 high-confidence\ntargets. We show that BinaryFinder correctly predicts the presence of close\ncompanions with a <5% false-positive rate, measures the detected binaries'\nposition angles within 2 degrees and separations within 25%, and weakly\nconstrains their contrast ratios. When applied to the full PTF dataset, we\nestimate that BinaryFinder will discover and characterize ~450,000\nphysically-associated binary systems with separations <2 arcseconds and\nmagnitudes brighter than R=18. New wide-field synoptic surveys with high\nsensitivity and sub-arcsecond angular resolution, such as LSST, will allow\nBinaryFinder to reliably detect millions of very faint binary systems with\nseparations as small as 0.1 arcseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We\nfocus on galaxies with classical bulges. Classical bulges seem to have the same\nformation history as ellipticals of the same mass, and we test if environment\ndetermines whether or not a classical bulge possesses a disc. Using the\nprojected fifth nearest neighbour density as a measure of local environment, we\nlook for correlations with environment at fixed bulge stellar mass. In groups\nwith fewer than 20 members, we find no evidence for changes in disc morphology\nwith local density. At fixed bulge mass, disc mass and disc scale length are\nindependent of local density. However, disc colour does increase (Delta(g - r)\n~ 0.05 mag) as a function of local density in relatively poor groups.\nTherefore, the colour--density relation for classical bulge+disc galaxies in\nthe field and in poor groups is due solely to changes in disc colour with\ndensity. In contrast, we find no correlations between disc colour and local\ndensity for classical bulge+disc galaxies in large, relaxed groups and\nclusters. However, there is a weak correlation between disc mass and group\ncrossing time, suggesting morphological transformation takes places in rich\ngroups. Our results add to the evidence that star formation is quenched in\ngroup environments, instead of clusters, and that star formation quenching and\nmorphological transformation are separate processes. Overall, we show that\nenvironment has two effects on galactic discs: relatively low density\nenvironments can quench star formation in discs, while processes occurring in\nhigher density environments contribute to the morphological transformation from\ndisc-dominated systems to bulge-dominated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

To identify such individuals, we train a\nstatistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each\nindividual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match\nthe classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks\nthat include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in\ngeneral, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender\nlanguage markers.

The emission from both molecules arises from the inner\nregion of the disk extending from approximately 13 AU from the central star.\nThe velocity profiles of the OH lines are narrower than the velocity profile of\nthe [O I] 6300 Angstrom line indicating that the OH in the disk is not\ncospatial with the O I. This suggests that the inner optically thin region of\nthe disk is largely devoid of molecular gas. Unlike the ro-vibrational CO\nemission lines, the OH lines are highly asymmetric. We show that the average CO\nand average OH line profiles can be fit with a model of a disk comprised of an\neccentric inner wall and a circular outer disk. In this model, the vast\nmajority of the OH flux (75%) originates from the inner wall, while the vast\nmajority of the CO flux (65%) originates on the surface of the disk at radii\ngreater than 13 AU.

Despite the practical importance of multi-class\nboosting, it has received far less attention than its binary counterpart. In\nthis work, we propose a fully-corrective multi-class boosting formulation which\ndirectly solves the multi-class problem without dividing it into multiple\nbinary classification problems. In contrast, most previous multi-class boosting\nalgorithms decompose a multi-boost problem into multiple binary boosting\nproblems. By explicitly deriving the Lagrange dual of the primal optimization\nproblem, we are able to construct a column generation-based fully-corrective\napproach to boosting which directly optimizes multi-class classification\nperformance. The new approach not only updates all weak learners' coefficients\nat every iteration, but does so in a manner flexible enough to accommodate\nvarious loss functions and regularizations.

Boosting with shared features is\nparticularly beneficial in complex prediction problems where features can be\nexpensive to compute.

At low\nenergy, three phases compete: 1) under-screening spin triplet (conventional)\nKE; 2) spin singlet potential scattering; 3) NFL phase where the roles of spin\nand orbital degrees of freedom are swapped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 05:06:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2013 08:39:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2013 14:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

However, it remains\ndifficult to increase the number of channels per node, thus the maximal degree\nof the network may be bounded. This is typically the case in grid topology\nnetworks, where each node has at most four neighbors. In this paper, we address\nthe following issue: if each node is likely to fail in an unpredictable manner,\nhow can we preserve some global reliability guarantees when the number of nodes\nkeeps increasing unboundedly ? To be more specific, we consider the problem or\nreliably broadcasting information on an asynchronous grid in the presence of\nByzantine failures -- that is, some nodes may have an arbitrary and potentially\nmalicious behavior. Our requirement is that a constant fraction of correct\nnodes remain able to achieve reliable communication. Existing solutions can\nonly tolerate a fixed number of Byzantine failures if they adopt a worst-case\nplacement scheme. Besides, if we assume a constant Byzantine ratio (each node\nhas the same probability to be Byzantine), the probability to have a fatal\nplacement approaches 1 when the number of nodes increases, and reliability\nguarantees collapse. In this paper, we propose the first broadcast protocol\nthat overcomes these difficulties. First, the number of Byzantine failures that\ncan be tolerated (if they adopt the worst-case placement) now increases with\nthe number of nodes. Second, we are able to tolerate a constant Byzantine\nratio, however large the grid may be. In other words, the grid becomes\nscalable. This result has important security applications in ultra-large\nnetworks, where each node has a given probability to misbehave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 06:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-18"}

Our approach is valid for a general class of\nstochastic, individual-based, stepping-stone models, with density-independent\ndemography and dispersal, provided the metapopulation is finite or else enjoys\nsome transitivity property.

These\ndata determine a Neumann and Dirichlet operator, a Dirichlet solution and a\nDirichlet-to-Neumann operator. The basic example we have in mind is a manifold\nwith boundary, where the quadratic form is the integral over the squared\nderivative, and the boundary map is the restriction of a function to (a subset\nof) the boundary of the manifold. As one of the main theorems, we derive a\nresolvent formula relating the difference of the resolvents of the Neumann and\nDirichlet operator with the Dirichlet solution and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann\noperator.

The transition is studied using the Polyakov loop model, with\nthe initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small\nneighborhood of the confining vacuum $l \\simeq 0$, as appropriate for $T <\nT_c$. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum\nbubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order\ntransition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum\nseparated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When\nthe initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same\ndirection (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not\nfind such bubble-like configurations. However, in this case we find huge\noscillations of $l$ with large length scales.

The Visual and Infrared Mapping\nSpectrometer (VIMS) instrument onboard the Cassini Spacecraft has obtained\nspectra of the rings between 0.35 and 5.2 microns with sufficient spatial\nresolution to discern variations on scales below 200 km. These relatively\nhigh-resolution spectral data reveal that both the depths of the near-infrared\nwater-ice absorption bands and the visible spectral slopes are often correlated\nwith structural parameters such as the rings' optical depth. Using a simplified\nmodel for the ring-particles' regolith properties, we have begun to disentangle\nthe trends due to changes in the gross composition of the ring particles from\nthose that may be due to shifts in the texture of the ring particles' regolith.\nConsistent with previous studies, this analysis finds that the C ring and the\nCassini Division possess enhanced concentrations of a contaminant that absorbs\nlight over a broad range of wavelengths. On the other hand, a second\ncontaminant that preferentially absorbs at short visible and near-ultraviolet\nwavelengths is found to be more evenly distributed throughout the rings. The\noptical activity of this short-wavelength absorber increases in the inner B\nring inwards of 100,000 km from Saturn center, which may provide clues to the\norigin of this contaminant. The spectral variations identified as shifts in the\nregolith texture are in some places clearly correlated with the ring's optical\ndepth, and in other locations they appear to be associated with the\ndisturbances generated by strong mean-motion resonances with Saturn's various\nmoons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 13:08:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 18:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

In this\nwork we investigate the evolution of these properties with increasing number of\nlayers (n) ranging from 1 to 10. Though, mono-layer of silicene possesses\nproperties similar to those of graphene, our results show that the geometric\nand electronic properties of multi-layers of silicene are strikingly different\nfrom those of multi-layers of graphene. We observe that there exist strong\ninter-layer covalent bondings between the layers in multi-layers of silicene as\nopposed to weak van der Waal's bonding which exists between the graphene\nlayers. The inter-layer bonding strongly influences the geometric and\nelectronic structures of these multi-layers. Like bi-layers of graphene,\nsilicene with two different stacking configurations AA and AB exhibits linear\nand parabolic dispersions around the Fermi level, respectively. However, unlike\ngraphene, for bi-layers of silicene, these dispersion curves are shifted in\nband diagram; this is due to the strong inter-layer bonding present in the\nlatter. For n > 3, we study the geometric and electronic properties of\nmulti-layers with four different stacking configurations namely, AAAA, AABB,\nABAB and ABC. Our results on cohesive energy show that all the multi-layers\nconsidered are energetically stable. Furthermore, we find that the three\nstacking configurations (AAAA, AABB and ABC) containing tetrahedral\ncoordination have much higher cohesive energy than that of Bernal (ABAB)\nstacking configuration. This is in contrast to the case of multi-layers of\ngraphene where ABAB is reported to be the lowest energy configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 13:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-26"}

In noble-gas\ndetectors for double-beta decay and dark matter experiments, SiPMs are\nattractive photosensors for imaging. However they are insensitive to the VUV\nscintillation emitted by the noble gases (xenon and argon). This difficulty is\novercome in the NEXT experiment by coating the SiPMs with tetraphenyl butadiene\n(TPB) to convert the VUV light into visible light. TPB requires stringent\nstorage and operational conditions to prevent its degradation by environmental\nagents. The development of UV sensitive SiPMs is thus of utmost interest for\nexperiments using electroluminescence of noble-gas detectors. It is in\nparticular an important issue for a robust and background free neutrinoless\ndouble-beta experiment with xenon gas aimed by NEXT.

We present a warped disc origin scenario for these stars\nassuming that an initially flat accretion disc becomes warped due to the\nPringle instability, or due to Bardeen-Petterson effect, before it fragments to\nstars. We show that this is plausible if the star formation efficiency\n$\\epsilon_{SF} \\lesssim 1$, and the viscosity parameter $\\alpha \\sim 0.1$.\nAfter fragmentation, we model the disc as a collection of concentric, circular,\nmutually tilted rings, and construct warped disc models for mass ratios and\nother parameters relevant to the GC environment, but also for more massive\ndiscs. We take into account the disc's self-gravity and the torques exerted by\na surrounding star cluster. We show that a self-gravitating low-mass disc ($M_d\n/ M_{bh} \\sim 0.001$) precesses in integrity in the life-time of the stars, but\nprecesses freely when the torques from a non-spherical cluster are included. An\nintermediate-mass disc ($M_d / M_{bh} \\sim 0.01$) breaks into pieces which\nprecess independently in the self-gravity-only case, and become disrupted in\nthe presence of the star cluster torques. For a high-mass disc ($M_d / M_{bh}\n\\sim 0.1$) the evolution is dominated by self-gravity and the disc is broken\nbut not dissolved. The time-scale after which the disc breaks scales almost\nlinearly with ($M_d / M_{bh}$) for self-gravitating models. Typical values are\nlonger than the age of the stars for a low mass disc, and are in the range\n$\\sim 8 \\times 10^4-10^5$ yr for high and intermediate-mass discs respectively.\nNone of these models explain the rotation properties of the two GC discs, but a\ncomparison of them with the clockwise disc shows that the lowest mass model in\na spherical star cluster matches the data best.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 14:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We\nintroduce a new approach based on reducing active imitation learning to i.i.d.\nactive learning, which can leverage progress in the i.i.d. setting. Our first\ncontribution, is to analyze reductions for both non-stationary and stationary\npolicies, showing that the label complexity (number of queries) of active\nimitation learning can be substantially less than passive learning. Our second\ncontribution, is to introduce a practical algorithm inspired by the reductions,\nwhich is shown to be highly effective in four test domains compared to a number\nof alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 17:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

In particular, a sparse subgraph\nextracted from the original graph is often required due to both theoretic and\npractical needs. Previous study clearly shows that the performance of different\nlearning algorithms, e.g., clustering and classification, benefits from such\nsparse subgraphs with balanced node connectivity. However, the existing graph\nconstruction methods are either computationally expensive or with\nunsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we utilize a scalable method called\nauction algorithm and its parallel extension to recover a sparse yet nearly\nbalanced subgraph with significantly reduced computational cost. Empirical\nstudy and comparison with the state-ofart approaches clearly demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method in both efficiency and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 17:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

In this study,\nwe present the first data-driven approach to discovering spectral drought\nstress indices, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem at massive\nscale. To make use of short range dependencies of spectral wavelengths, we\ndevelop an online variational Bayes algorithm for latent Dirichlet allocation\nwith convolved Dirichlet regularizer. This approach scales to massive datasets\nand, hence, provides a more objective complement to plant physiological\npractices. The spectral topics found conform to plant physiological knowledge\nand can be computed in a fraction of the time compared to existing LDA\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 17:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

Brief reviews are first given on the\ncosmic-ray-driven electron-induced-reaction (CRE) theory for O3 depletion and\nthe warming theory of CFCs for climate change. Then natural and anthropogenic\ncontributions are examined in detail and separated well through in-depth\nstatistical analyses of comprehensive measured datasets. For O3 loss, new\nstatistical analyses of the CRE equation with observed data of total O3 and\nstratospheric temperature give high linear correlation coefficients >=0.92.\nAfter removal of the CR effect, a pronounced recovery by 20~25% of the\nAntarctic O3 hole is found, while no recovery of O3 loss in mid-latitudes has\nbeen observed. These results show both the dominance of the CRE mechanism and\nthe success of the Montreal Protocol. For global climate change, in-depth\nanalyses of observed data clearly show that the solar effect and human-made\nhalogenated gases played the dominant role in Earth climate change prior to and\nafter 1970, respectively. Remarkably, a statistical analysis gives a nearly\nzero correlation coefficient (R=-0.05) between global surface temperature and\nCO2 concentration in 1850-1970. In contrast, a nearly perfect linear\ncorrelation with R=0.96-0.97 is found between global surface temperature and\ntotal amount of stratospheric halogenated gases in 1970-2012. Further, a new\ntheoretical calculation on the greenhouse effect of halogenated gases shows\nthat they (mainly CFCs) could alone lead to the global surface temperature rise\nof ~0.6 deg C in 1970-2002. These results provide solid evidence that recent\nglobal warming was indeed caused by anthropogenic halogenated gases. Thus, a\nslow reversal of global temperature to the 1950 value is predicted for coming\n5~7 decades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 16:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 04:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-31"}
