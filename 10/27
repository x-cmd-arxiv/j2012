We use as\ninput into our modeling the Millennium II Cosmological Simulation and the\nupdated semi-analytic galaxy catalog by Guo et al. (2011) to self-consistently\naccount for the star formation history (SFH) and metallicity evolution of each\ngalaxy. We run a grid of 192 models, varying all the parameters known from\nprevious studies to affect the evolution of XRBs. We use our models and\nobservationally derived prescriptions for hot gas emission to create\ntheoretical galaxy X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for several redshift bins.\nModels with low CE efficiencies, a 50% twins mass ratio distribution, a steeper\nIMF exponent, and high stellar wind mass loss rates best match observational\nresults from Tzanavaris & Georgantopoulos (2008), though they significantly\nunderproduce bright early-type and very bright (Lx > 10d41) late-type galaxies.\nThese discrepancies are likely caused by uncertainties in hot gas emission and\nSFHs, AGN contamination, and a lack of dynamically formed Low-mass XRBs. In our\nhighest likelihood models, we find that hot gas emission dominates the emission\nfor most bright galaxies. We also find that the evolution of the normal galaxy\nX-ray luminosity density out to z = 4 is driven largely by XRBs in galaxies\nwith X-ray luminosities between 10d40 and 10d41 erg/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 16:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 19:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 07:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For instance, can we estimate\nstellar age and metallicity distributions? Can we separate star-forming\ngalaxies from AGN? Can we measure emission lines, nebular abundances and\nextinction? With what precision?\n  To accomplish this, we selected a sample of about 300k galaxies with good S/N\nfrom the SDSS and divided them in two groups: 200k objects and a template\nlibrary of 100k. We corrected the spectra to $z = 0$ and converted them to\nfilter fluxes. Using a statistical approach, we calculated a Probability\nDistribution Function (PDF) for each property of each object and the library.\nSince we have the properties of all the data from the {\\sc starlight}-SDSS\ndatabase, we could compare them with the results obtained from summaries of the\nPDF (mean, median, etc).\n  Our results shows that we retrieve the weighted average of the log of the\ngalaxy age with a good error margin ($\\sigma \\approx 0.1 - 0.2$ dex), and\nsimilarly for the physical properties such as mass-to-light ratio, mean stellar\nmetallicity, etc. Furthermore, our main result is that we can derive emission\nline intensities and ratios with similar precision.

This non revealing game is defined by restricting the players not\nto reveal any information on the {\\it limit behavior} of their own Markov\nchain, as in Renault 2006. There are two key technical difficulties in the\nproof: 1) proving regularity, in the sense of equicontinuity, of the $T$-stage\nnon revealing value functions, and 2) constructing strategies by blocks in\norder to link the values of the non revealing games with the original values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 19:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 19:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

Using H-alpha fluxes, stellar masses (M_star), and star formation rates\n(SFR) from galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), combined with HI\ndata from the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey and the Herschel Reference Survey, we\nestimate that a H-alpha survey with a luminosity sensitivity of L_H-alpha =\n1e40 erg/s at 200 Mpc could achieve a completeness of f_SFR ~ 75% with respect\nto total SFR, but only f_Mstar ~ 33% with respect to stellar mass (due to lack\nof sensitivity to early-type galaxies). These numbers are significantly lower\nthan those achieved by an idealized spectroscopic survey due to the loss of\nH-alpha flux resulting from resolving out nearby galaxies and the inability to\ncorrect for the underlying stellar continuum. An HI survey with sensitivity\nsimilar to the proposed WALLABY survey on ASKAP could achieve f_SFR ~ 80% and\nf_Mstar ~ 50%, somewhat higher than that of the H-alpha survey. Finally, both\nH-alpha and HI surveys should achieve > 50% completeness with respect to the\nhost galaxies of short duration gamma-ray bursts, which may trace the\npopulation of binary neutron star mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We find that the latter model fits the\nintegrated burst spectrum significantly better than the former, and that their\nrespective spectral parameters are dramatically different: when fit with a Band\nfunction only, the Epeak of the event is unusually soft for a short GRB, while\nadding a thermal component leads to more typical short GRB values.

By using models with an\ninternal angular momentum distribution and comparing these with measurements of\nrotation periods of subgiant stars we investigate the agreement between\ntheoretical predictions and observational results. With this comparison we can\nalso reduce the global stellar parameter space compatible with the rotational\nperiod measurements from subgiant light curves.

The primordial non-Gaussianity effects\non the mass function and halo bias are considered. We adopt self-calibration\nfor the mass-observable scaling relation, and evaluate constraints for the SPT,\nPlanck, CCAT--like, SPTPol and ACTPol surveys. We show that the\nscale-dependence of halo bias induced by the local NG provides strong\nconstraints on $\\fnl$, while the results from number count are two orders of\nmagnitude worse. When combining information from number counts and power\nspectrum, the \\planck\\ cluster catalog provides the tightest constraint with\n$\\sigma_{\\fnl}=7$ (68% C.L.) even for relatively conservative assumptions on\nthe expected cluster yields and systematics. This value is a factor of 2\nsmaller than the $1\\sigma$ error as measured by WMAP CMB measurements, and\ncomparable to what expected from Planck. We find that the results are mildly\nsensitive to the mass threshold of the surveys, but strongly depend on the\nsurvey coverage: a full-sky survey like Planck is more favorable because it can\nprobe longer wavelengths modes which are most sensitive to NG effects. In\naddition, the constraints are largely insensitive to priors on nuisance\nparameters as they are mainly driven by the power spectrum probe which has a\nmild dependence on the mass-observable relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2012 00:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In this paper we extend earlier work to three-point shear\nstatistics. We show that, relative to the predictions of dark matter only\nmodels, the amplitude of the signal can be reduced by as much as 30-40% on\nscales of a few arcminutes. We find that baryonic feedback may affect two- and\nthree-point shear statistics differently and demonstrate that this can be used\nto assess the fidelity of various feedback models. In particular, upcoming\nsurveys such as Euclid might be able to discriminate between different feedback\nmodels by measuring both second- and third-order statistics. Because it will\nlikely remain impossible to predict baryonic feedback with high accuracy from\nfirst principles, we argue in favour of phenomenological models that can\ncapture the relevant effects of baryonic feedback processes in addition to\nchanges in cosmology. We construct such a model by modifying the dark\nmatter-only halo model to characterise the generic effects of energetic\nfeedback using a small number of parameters. We use this model to perform a\nlikelihood analysis in a simplified case in which two- and three-point shear\nstatistics are measured between 0.5 and 20 arcmin and in which the amplitude of\nfluctuations, sigma8, the matter density parameter, Om, and the dark energy\nparameter, w0, are the only unknown free parameters. We demonstrate that for\nweak lensing surveys such as Euclid, marginalising over the feedbac parameters\ndescribing the effects of baryonic processes, such as outflows driven by\nfeedback from star formation and AGN, may be able to mitigate the bias\naffecting Om, sigma8 and w0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2012 08:11:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2013 14:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We explore this in various signals: (i)\nReionization history: including X-rays results in an earlier, more extended\nreionization. Efficient thermal feedback from X-ray heating could yield an\nextended, ~10% ionized epoch. (ii) Reionization morphology: a sizable (~10%)\ncontribution of X-rays to reionization results in a more uniform morphology,\nthough the impact is modest when compared at the same global neutral fraction,\nxH. However, changes in morphology cannot be countered by increasing the bias\nof the ionizing sources, making them a robust signature. (iii) The kinetic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect: at a fixed reionization history, X-rays\ndecrease the kSZ power at l=3000 by ~0.5 microK^2. Our extreme model in which\nX-rays dominate reionization is the only one that is marginally consistent with\nupper limits from the South Pole Telescope, assuming no thermal\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) - dusty galaxy correlation. Since this extreme model\nis unlikely, we conclude that there should be a sizable tSZ-dusty galaxy\nsignal. (iv) The cosmic 21cm signal: the impact of X-rays on the 21cm power\nspectrum during the advanced stages of reionization (xH<0.7) is modest, except\nin extreme, X-ray dominated models. The largest impact of X-rays is to govern\nIGM heating. In fact, unless thermal feedback is efficient, the epoch of X-ray\nheating likely overlaps with the beginning of reionization (xH>0.9). This\nresults in a 21cm power spectrum which is ~ 10-100 times higher than obtained\nfrom naive estimates ignoring this overlap. However, if thermal feedback is\nefficient, the resulting extended epoch between X-ray heating and reionization\ncould provide a clean probe of the matter power spectrum in emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2012 13:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2013 21:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2013 16:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We call them flag structures. The\nconstruction of the canonical frames for these structures can be given in the\ntwo prolongation steps: the first step, based on our previous works, gives the\ncanonical bundle of moving frames for the fixed submanifolds of flags on each\nfiber and the second step consists of the prolongation of the bundle obtained\nin the first step. The bundle obtained in the first step is not as a rule a\nprincipal bundle so that the classical Tanaka prolongation procedure for\nfiltered structures can not be applied to it. However, under natural\nassumptions on submanifolds of flags and on the ambient distribution, this\nbundle satisfies a nice weaker property. The main goal of the present paper is\nto formalize this property, introducing the so-called quasi-principle frame\nbundles, and to generalize the Tanaka prolongation procedure to these bundles.\nApplications to the equivalence problems for systems of differential equations\nof mixed order, bracket generating distributions, sub-Riemannian and more\ngeneral structures on distributions are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2012 15:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 13:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-20"}

While\narguments for the link between specialization and productivity are common,\ndiversity has often been invoked as a hedging strategy, allowing systems to\nevolve in response to environmental change. Despite their general appeal, these\narguments have not typically produced quantitative predictions for optimal\nlevels of functional diversity consistent with observations. One important\nreason why these relationships have resisted formalization is the idiosyncratic\nnature of diversity measures, which depend on given classification schemes.\nHere, we address these issues by analyzing the statistics of professions in\ncities and show how their probability distribution takes a universal\nscale-invariant form, common to all cities, obtained in the limit of infinite\nresolution of given taxonomies. We propose a model that generates the form and\nparameters of this distribution via the introduction of new occupations at a\nrate leading to individual specialization subject to the preservation of access\nto overall function via their ego social networks.
