Our goal was to perform a detailed\nanalysis of the optical period and phase drift of the main peak of the Crab\npulsar and compare it with the Jodrell Bank ephemerides. We determined the\nposition of the main peak using the steepest zero of the cross-correlation\nfunction between the pulsar signal and an accurate optical template. The pulsar\nrotational period and period derivative have been measured with great accuracy\nusing observations covering only a 2 day time interval. The error on the period\nis 1.7 ps, limited only by the statistical uncertainty. Both the rotational\nfrequency and its first derivative are in agreement with those from the Jodrell\nBank radio ephemerides archive. We also found evidence of the optical peak\nleading the radio one by ~230 microseconds. The distribution of phase-residuals\nof the whole dataset is slightly wider than that of a synthetic signal\ngenerated as a sequence of pulses distributed in time with the probability\nproportional to the pulse shape, such as the average count rate and background\nlevel are those of the Crab pulsar observed with Aqueye. The counting\nstatistics and quality of the data allowed us to determine the pulsar period\nand period derivative with great accuracy in 2 days only. The time of arrival\nof the optical peak of the Crab pulsar leads the radio one in agreement with\nwhat recently reported in the literature. The distribution of the phase\nresiduals can be approximated with a Gaussian and is consistent with being\ncompletely caused by photon noise (for the best data sets).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 16:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In the\n1970s, there were only a few known operators, for example, the derivative\noperator, the difference operator, the average operator, and the Rota-Baxter\noperator. A few more appeared after Rota posed his problem. However, little\nprogress was made to solve this problem in general. In part, this is because\nthe precise meaning of the problem is not so well understood. In this paper, we\npropose a formulation of the problem using the framework of operated algebras\nand viewing an associative algebra with a linear operator as one that satisfies\na certain operated polynomial identity. This framework also allows us to apply\ntheories of rewriting systems and Gr\\\"{o}bner-Shirshov bases. To narrow our\nfocus more on the operators that Rota was interested in, we further consider\ntwo particular classes of operators, namely, those that generalize differential\nor Rota-Baxter operators. As it turns out, these two classes of operators\ncorrespond to those that possess Gr\\\"obner-Shirshov bases under two different\nmonomial orderings. Working in this framework, and with the aid of computer\nalgebra, we are able to come up with a list of these two classes of operators,\nand provide some evidence that these lists may be complete. Our search has\nrevealed quite a few new operators of these types whose properties are expected\nto be similar to the differential operator and Rota-Baxter operator\nrespectively.\n  Recently, a more unified approach has emerged in related areas, such as\ndifference algebra and differential algebra, and Rota-Baxter algebra and\nNijenhuis algebra. The similarities in these theories can be more efficiently\nexplored by advances on Rota's problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 17:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

Our analysis\nstarts with the adsorption of a single carbon ad-atom and examines its\nmigrations. Once a C$_2$ nucleates on h-BN, the insertion of each additional\ncarbon at its close proximity causes a short segment of carbon atomic chain to\ngrow by one atom at at a time in a quaint way: The existing chain leaves its\ninitial position and subsequently is attached from its bottom end to the top of\nthe carbon ad-atom. The electronic, magnetic and structural properties of these\nchains vertically adsorbed to h-BN depend on the number of carbon atoms in the\nchain, such that they exhibit an even-odd disparity. An individual carbon chain\ncan also modify the electronic structure with localized states in the wide band\ngap of h-BN. As a reverse situation we examined the growth of short BN atomic\nchains on graphene, which attribute diverse properties depending on whether B\nor N is the atom bound to the substrate. These results together with ab-initio\nmolecular dynamics simulations of the growth process reveal the interesting\nself-assembly behavior of the grown chains. Furthermore, we find that these\natomic chains enhance the chemical activity of h-BN and graphene sheets by\ncreating active sites for the bonding of various ad-atoms and can act as\npillars between two and multiple sheets of these honeycomb structures leaving\nwider spacing between them to achieve high capacity storage of specific\nmolecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 17:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-17"}

Our investigation\nstudies how well the quadrupole-only waveform model matches the signal as a\nfunction of the inclination and orientation of the source and how the modes\ncontribute to the distance reach into the Universe of Advanced LIGO for a fixed\nset of internal source parameters. The mismatch between signals and\nquadrupole-only waveform can be large, dropping below 0.97 for up to 65% of the\nsource-sky for the non-precessing cases we studied, and over a larger area in\none precessing case. There is a corresponding 30% increase in detection volume\nthat could be achieved by adding higher modes to the search; however, this is\nmitigated by the fact that the mismatch is largest for signals which radiate\nthe least energy and to which the search is therefore least sensitive.\nLikewise, the mismatch is largest in directions from the source along which the\nleast energy is radiated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 23:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

However, in spite of its great potential and research\nhistory over many decades, these systems are not commonly used. One of the main\nproblems is that existing methods use diffusive jets, which result in scattered\npenetration and severe deceleration of the jets, causing frequent pain and\ninsufficient penetration. Another longstanding challenge is the development of\naccurate small volume injections. In this paper we employ a novel method of\nneedle-free drug injection, using highly-focused high speed microjets, which\naims to solve these challenges. We experimentally demonstrate that these unique\njets are able to penetrate human skin: the focused nature of these microjets\ncreates an injection spot smaller than a mosquito's proboscis and guarantees a\nhigh percentage of the liquid being injected. The liquid substances can be\ndelivered to a much larger depth than conventional methods, and create a\nwell-controlled dispersion pattern. Thanks to the excellent controllability of\nthe microjet, small volume injections become feasible. Furthermore, the\npenetration dynamics is studied through experiments performed on gelatin\nmixtures (human soft tissue equivalent) and human skin, agreeing well with a\nviscous stress model which we develop. This model predicts the depth of the\npenetration into both human skin and soft tissue.

The effect of self-gravity of the gas in\nthe 2D disk can be important in confronting observations and numerical\nsimulations in detail. For use in such applications, a new method for the\ncalculation of the gravitational force of a 2D disk is presented. Instead of\nsolving the complete potential function problem, we calculate the force in\ninfinite planes in Cartesian and polar coordinates by a reproducing kernel\nmethod. Under the limitation of a 2D disk, we specifically represent the force\nas a double summation of a convolution of the surface density and a fundamental\nkernel and employ a fast Fourier transform technique. In this method, the\nentire computational complexity can be reduced from $O(N^2\\times N^2)$ to\n$O((N\\times \\log_2(N)^2)$, where $N$ is the number of zones in one dimension.\nThis approach does not require softening. The proposed method is similar to a\nspectral method, but without the necessity of imposing a periodic boundary\ncondition. We further show this approach is of near second order accuracy for a\nsmooth surface density in a Cartesian coordinate system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2012 04:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-09"}

Consistency between experimental observations, density\nfunctional theory and molecular dynamics calculations confirmed that the\nresultant force of the compression, the repulsion, and the recovery of\nelectron-pair dislocations differentiates ice from other materials in response\nto pressure. The compression shortens and strengthens the longer-and-softer\nintermolecular O:H lone-pair virtual-bond; the repulsion pushes the bonding\nelectron pair away from the H+/p and hence lengthens and weakens the\nintramolecular H-O real-bond. The virtual-bond compression and the real-bond\nelongation symmetrize the O:H-O as observed at ~60 GPa and result in the\nabnormally low compressibility of ice. The virtual-bond stretching phonons (<\n400 cm-1) are thus stiffened and the real-bond stretching phonons (> 3000 cm-1)\nsoftened upon compression. The cohesive energy of the real-bond dominates and\nits loss lowers the critical temperature for the VIII-VII phase transition. The\npolarization of the lone electron pairs and the entrapment of the bonding\nelectron pairs by compression expand the band gap consequently. Findings should\nform striking impact to understanding the physical anomalies of H2O.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2012 05:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-08"}

Among many parameters that impact the degree of\npolarization (DOP) of a QD system, the shape asymmetry is a critical factor. We\nperform multi-million-atom simulations to study the impact of the elliptical\nshapes on the electronic and polarization properties of single and vertically\nstacked InAs QDs. The comparison between a low aspect ratio (AR) and a high AR\nQD reveals that the electronic and the polarization properties strongly depend\non the AR of the QD; the elongation of a tall QD allows tuning of the DOP over\na much wider range. We then extend our analysis to an experimentally reported\nvertical stack of nine QDs (9-VSQDs) that has shown significant potential to\nachieve isotropic polarization properties. We analyse the contribution from the\nshape asymmetry in the large, experimentally measured, in-plane polarization\nanisotropy. Our analysis shows that the orientation of the base elongation\ncontrols the sign of the DOP; however the magnitude of the base elongation has\nonly a very little impact on the magnitude of the DOP. We further predict that\nthe elliptical shape of the 9-VSQDs can only tune either DOP[110] or DOP[-110]\nfor an isotropic response. Our model results, in agreement with the TEM\nfindings, suggest that the experimentally grown 9-VSQDs has either a\ncircular-base or a slightly [-110] elongated base.

In this contribution we aim to determine the\nabsolute dimensions of the long-period sdB+MS binary system PG1104+243.\nHigh-resolution spectroscopy time-series were obtained with HERMES at the\nMercator telescope at La Palma, and analyzed to obtain radial velocities of\nboth components.

The gravitational redshift provided an independent confirmation of\nthe surface gravity of the sdB component. An orbital period of 753 +- 3 d and a\nmass ratio of q = 0.637 +- 0.015 were found from the RV-curves. The sdB\ncomponent has an effective temperature of Teff = 33500 +- 1200 K and a surface\ngravity of logg = 5.84 +- 0.08 dex, while the cool companion is found to be a\nG-type star with Teff = 5930 +- 160 K and logg = 4.29 +- 0.05 dex.

The result accounts for nonequilibrium phonon\ndistributions induced by the source-drain bias voltage, and concomitantly\nsatisfies the fluctuation theorem. Extending the counting field to the complex\nplane, we investigate the locations of possible singularities of the cumulant\ngenerating function, and exploit them to identify regimes in which the electron\ntransfer is affected differently by the coupling to the phonons. Within a\nlarge-deviation analysis, we find a kink in the probability distribution,\nanalogous to a first-order phase transition in thermodynamics, which would be a\nunique hallmark of the electron-phonon correlations. This kink reflects the\nfact that although inelastic scattering by the phonons once the voltage exceeds\ntheir frequency can scatter electrons opposite to the bias, this will never\ngenerate current flowing against the bias at zero temperature, in accordance\nwith the fluctuation theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2012 15:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 19:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}
