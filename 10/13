The focus of our\nresearch is placed on the elucidation of correlated dynamics of a large\nensemble of particles in the course of the nanoscale liquid-solid phase\ntransition through the computation and analysis of the results of molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations with the corresponding theoretical model. This\nproblem is of significant interest and importance, because the controlled\ndynamics of systems on the nanoscale is one of the central topics in the\ndevelopment of modern nanotechnologies.\n  MD simulations in large molecular systems are rather computer power\ndemanding. Therefore, in order to advance with MD simulations we have used\nmodern computational methods based on the graphics processing units (GPU). The\nadvantages of the use of GPUs for MD simulations in comparison with the CPUs\nare demonstrated and benchmarked. The reported speedup reaches factors greater\nthan 400.

We monitored a number of erupting episodes in the past\nfew years, and increased the density of our observations during eruptive\nepisodes. In this paper we present the full historical data set from 2009-2012\nwith multi-wavelength dense coverage of the two high luminosity events between\nAugust - September 2012. We construct bolometric light curves and measure the\ntotal luminosities of these eruptive or explosive events.

The\nlatter event reached an absolute R-band magnitude of about -18, comparable to\nthat of a core-collapse supernova (SN). Our historical monitoring has detected\nhigh-velocity spectral features (~13000 km/s) in September 2011, one year\nbefore the current SN-like event. This implies that the detection of such high\nvelocity outflows cannot, conclusively, point to a core-collapse SN origin. We\nsuggest that the initial peak in the 2012a event was unlikely to be due to a\nfaint core-collapse SN. We propose that the high intrinsic luminosity of the\nlatest peak, the variability history of SN 2009ip, and the detection of broad\nspectral lines indicative of high-velocity ejecta are consistent with a\npulsational pair-instability event, and that the star may have survived the\nlast outburst.

We perform cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations, including star formation, chemical enrichment, and four cases of\nSNe-driven outflows: no wind (NW), an energy-driven constant velocity wind\n(CW), a radially varying wind (RVWa) where the outflow velocity has a positive\ncorrelation with galactocentric distance (r), and a RVW with additional\ndependence on halo mass (RVWb). Overall, we find that the outflows expel\nmetal-enriched gas away from galaxies, significantly quench star formation, and\nenrich the CGM. At z = 2, the radial profiles of gas properties around galaxy\ncenters are most sensitive to the choice of the wind model for halo masses\n(10^9 - 10^11) M_sun. We infer that the RVWb model is similar to the NW case,\nexcept that it substantially enriches the CGM: the carbon metallicity (Z_C) is\n10 times higher in RVWb than in NW at r > R_200; and the warm gas of 10^4 -\n10^5 K and delta < 100 is enriched to 50 times higher than in NW. We also find\nthat the impact of models CW and RVWa are similar, with the following\ndifferences. RVWa causes a greater suppression of star formation rate at z < 5,\nand has a higher fraction of low-density (delta < 10), warm-hot (10^4 - 10^6 K)\ngas than in CW. Outflows in CW produce a higher and earlier enrichment of some\nIGM phases than RVWa. By visual inspection, we note that the RVWa model shows\nmore pronounced bipolar outflows and galactic disks.

In this model, LABs are the\nmost massive halos with the strongest clustering (proto-clusters) undergoing\nextreme starbursts in the high-z universe. Aided by calculations of detailed\nradiative transfer of Lya photons through ultra-high resolution (159pc)\nlarge-scale (>30Mpc) adaptive mesh-refinement cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations with galaxy formation, this model is shown to be able to, for the\nfirst time, reproduce simultaneously the global Lya luminosity function and\nluminosity-size relation of the observed LABs. Physically, a combination of\ndust attenuation of Lya photons within galaxies, clustering of galaxies, and\ncomplex propagation of Lya photons through circumgalactic and intergalactic\nmedium gives rise to the large sizes and frequently irregular isophotal shapes\nof LABs that are observed. A generic and unique prediction of this model is\nthat there should be strong far-infrared (FIR) sources within each LAB, with\nthe most luminous FIR source likely representing the gravitational center of\nthe proto-cluster, not necessarily the apparent center of the Lya emission of\nthe LAB or the most luminous optical source.

Two problems are considered and are\nrelated to each other: how to report the findings for observed experimental\ndata, and how to evaluate the ability of a future experiment to determine the\nneutrino mass hierarchy, namely, sensitivity of the experiment. For the first\nproblem where experimental data have already been observed, the classical\nstatistical analysis involves constructing confidence intervals for the\nparameter {\\Delta}m^2_{32}. These intervals are deduced from the parent\ndistribution of the estimation of {\\Delta}m^2_{32} based on experimental data.\nDue to existing experimental constraints on |{\\Delta}m^2_{32}|, the estimation\nof {\\Delta}m^2_{32} is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution (a\nBinomial distribution with 1 trial) rather than a Gaussian distribution.\nTherefore, the Feldman-Cousins approach needs to be used instead of the\nGaussian approximation in constructing confidence intervals. Furthermore, as a\nresult of the definition of confidence intervals, even if it is correctly\nconstructed, its confidence level does not directly reflect how much one\nhypothesis of the MH is supported by the data rather than the other hypothesis.\nWe thus describe a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence provided by\nthe observed experimental data through the (posterior) probability that either\none hypothesis of MH is true. This Bayesian presentation of observed\nexperimental results is then used to develop several metrics to assess the\nsensitivity of future experiments.

In practical lithium-ion batteries, capacity fade occurs\nover thousands of cycles, limited by slow electrochemical processes, such as\nthe formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the negative\nelectrode, which compete with reversible lithium intercalation. Focusing on SEI\ngrowth as the canonical degradation mechanism, we show that a simple\nsingle-particle model can accurately explain experimentally observed capacity\nfade in commercial cells with graphite anodes, and predict future fade based on\nlimited accelerated aging data for short times and elevated temperatures. The\ntheory is extended to porous electrodes, predicting that SEI growth is\nessentially homogeneous throughout the electrode, even at high rates. The\nlifetime distribution for a sample of batteries is found to be consistent with\nGaussian statistics, as predicted by the single-particle model. We also extend\nthe theory to rapidly degrading anodes, such as nanostructured silicon, which\nexhibit large expansion on ion intercalation. In such cases, large area changes\nduring cycling promote SEI loss and faster SEI growth. Our simple models are\nable to accurately fit a variety of published experimental data for graphite\nand silicon anodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 03:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 06:20:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 17:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

This suggests the presence of downward\npointing cusps at those points.\n  At stagnation points on the axis of symmetry, the unique blow-up profile\nconsistent with the invariant scaling of the equation is Garabedian's pointed\nbubble solution with water above air. Thus at stagnation points on the axis of\nsymmetry with no water above the stagnation point, the invariant scaling of the\nequation cannot be the right scaling.

Our analysis combines\nChandra and XMM-Newton data using an energy-dependent cross-calibration. After\nconsidering a number of scaling relations, we find that gas mass is the most\nrobust estimator of weak lensing mass, yielding 15 +/- 6% intrinsic scatter at\nr500 (the pseudo-pressure YX has a consistent scatter of 22%+/-5%). The scatter\ndoes not change when measured within a fixed physical radius of 1 Mpc. Clusters\nwith small BCG to X-ray peak offsets constitute a very regular population whose\nmembers have the same gas mass fractions and whose even smaller <10% deviations\nfrom regularity can be ascribed to line of sight geometrical effects alone.\nCool-core clusters, while a somewhat different population, also show the same\n(<10%) scatter in the gas mass-lensing mass relation. There is a good\ncorrelation and a hint of bimodality in the plane defined by BCG offset and\ncentral entropy (or central cooling time). The pseudo-pressure YX does not\ndiscriminate between the more relaxed and less relaxed populations, making it\nperhaps the more even-handed mass proxy for surveys. Overall, hydrostatic\nmasses underestimate weak lensing masses by 10% on the average at r500; but\ncool-core clusters are consistent with no bias, while non-cool-core clusters\nhave a large and constant 15-20% bias between r2500 and r500, in agreement with\nN-body simulations incorporating unthermalized gas.

The interest of the present\nwork is associated with a microsphere composite material, which is modelled as\na matrix-inclusion composite. The matrix phase is a homogeneous isotropic\nnonlinear rubber-like material and the inclusion phase is more complex,\nconsisting of a distribution of sizes of stiff thin spherical shells filled\nwith gas. Experimentally, such materials have been shown to undergo complex\ndeformation under cyclic loading. Here, we consider microspheres embedded in an\nunbounded host material and assume that a hydrostatic pressure is applied in\nthe \"far-field\".

Across all samples, 97% of the\nmicrobial community is made up of two dominant OTUs identified as the\n{\\alpha}-proteobacterium Wolbachia and an unnamed {\\gamma}-proteobacterium from\nthe Enterobacteriaceae. Microbial communities varied among host populations for\nmeasures of community diversity and exhibited significant population structure.\nWe also uncovered a strong negative correlation in the abundance of the two\ndominant OTUs, suggesting they may fulfill similar roles as nutritional\nmutualists. This broad survey represents the most comprehensive assessment, to\ndate, of the microbes that associate with bed bugs, and uncovers evidence for\npotential antagonism between the two dominant members of the bed bug\nmicrobiome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 13:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

For this new estimator, we establish a\nnon-asymptotic recovery error bound. More importantly, we quantify the\nreduction of the recovery error bound for this rank-corrected procedure.\nCompared with the one obtained for the nuclear norm penalized least squares\nestimator, this reduction can be substantial (around 50%). We also provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for rank consistency in the sense of Bach\n(2008). Very interestingly, these conditions are highly related to the concept\nof constraint nondegeneracy in matrix optimization. As a byproduct, our results\nprovide a theoretical foundation for the majorized penalty method of Gao and\nSun (2010) and Gao (2010) for structured low-rank matrix optimization problems.\nExtensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed rank-corrected\nprocedure can simultaneously achieve a high recovery accuracy and capture the\nlow-rank structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 14:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 21:44:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 17:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}
