For axial motion we\nconsider a simple rod model, and for flexural motion we employ the\nEuler-Bernoulli kinematic hypothesis and consider both a conventional\ntransverse motion model and an inextensional planar motion model. The\nunderlying formulation uses the Cauchy stress and the Green-Lagrange strain.\nFor all models, we consider linear constitutive relations in order to isolate\nthe effect of finite motion. The proposed methodology, however, is applicable\nto problems that also exhibit material nonlinearity. For the rod model, we\nobtain the exact analytical explicit solution of the derived finite-deformation\ndispersion relation, and compare it with data obtained via numerical simulation\nof nonlinear wave motion in a finite rod. For the beam model, we obtain a\nsolution by numerical root finding. The results allow us to quantify the\ndeviation in the dispersion curves when exact large deformation is considered\ncompared to following the assumption of infinitesimal deformation. We show that\nincorporation of finite deformation following the chosen definitions of stress\nand strain raises the frequency branches for both axial and flexural waves\nabove the nominal values associated with linear motion.

We use a simplified dynamical model and a robust\nchemical network, as opposed to previous studies which have used a three\ndimensional circulation model coupled to a simple chemical kinetics scheme. The\ntemperature structure and distribution of the main atmospheric constituents are\ncalculated in the limit of an atmosphere that rotates as a solid body with an\nequatorial rotation rate of 1 km/s. Such motion mimics a uniform zonal wind\nwhich resembles the equatorial superrotation structure found by three\ndimensional circulation models. The uneven heating of this tidally locked\nplanet causes, even in the presence of such a strong zonal wind, large\ntemperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside, of up to 800 K. This\nwould result in important longitudinal variations of some molecular abundances\nif the atmosphere were at chemical equilibrium. The zonal wind, however, acts\nas a powerful disequilibrium process. We identify the existence of a pressure\nlevel of transition between two regimes, which may be located between 100 and\n0.1 mbar depending on the molecule. Below this transition layer, chemical\nequilibrium holds, while above it, the zonal wind tends to homogenize the\nchemical composition of the atmosphere, bringing molecular abundances in the\nlimb and nightside regions close to chemical equilibrium values characteristic\nof the dayside, i.e. producing an horizontal quenching effect in the\nabundances. Reasoning based on timescales arguments indicates that horizontal\nand vertical mixing are likely to compete in HD 209458b's atmosphere, producing\na complex distribution where molecular abundances are quenched horizontally to\ndayside values and vertically to chemical equilibrium values characteristic of\ndeep layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 18:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Failure\nto reach the collective target thus has dire consequences for all group\nmembers, independently of their strategies. Wanting to move away from\nunfavorable locations is therefore all but surprising. Inspired by these\nobservations, we here propose and study a collective-risk social dilemma where\nplayers are allowed to move if the collective failure becomes too probable.\nMore precisely, this so-called risk-driven migration is launched depending on\nthe difference between the actual contributions and the declared target.\nMobility therefore becomes an inherent property that is utilized in an entirely\nself-organizing manner. We show that under these assumptions cooperation is\npromoted much more effectively than under the action of manually determined\nmigration rates. For the latter, we in fact identify parameter regions where\nthe evolution of cooperation is incredibly inhibited. Moreover, we find\nunexpected spatial patterns where cooperators that do not form compact clusters\noutperform those that do, and where defectors are able to utilize strikingly\ndifferent ways of invasion. The presented results support the recently revealed\nimportance of percolation for the successful evolution of public cooperation,\nwhile at the same time revealing surprisingly simple ways of self-organization\ntowards socially desirable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 19:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-25"}

Some conditions of conduction\nfailure have been studied for anisotropy or simple curved surfaces, but the\ngeneral conditions on anisotropic curved surfaces (anisotropic and curved\nsurface) remain unknown. To predict and analyze conduction failure on\nanisotropic curved surfaces, a new analytic approach is proposed, called the\nrelative acceleration approach borrowed from spacetime physics.

The detection confirms that the optical\nemission of MAXI J1659-152 during quiescence is relatively bright comparing to\nother black hole X-ray transients. This implies that the distance to MAXI\nJ1659-152 is 4.6-7.5 kpc for a M2 dwarf companion star, or 2.3-3.8 kpc for a M5\ndwarf companion star. By comparing with other measurements, a M2 dwarf\ncompanion is more likely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We have considered\nbeta_0=10^2, 10^3 and 10^4 and in the first two cases the most unstable linear\nMRI modes are well resolved in the simulations. We find that the behavior of\nthe MRI turbulence strongly depends on beta_0: The radial transport of angular\nmomentum increases with net vertical flux, achieving alpha=0.08 for beta_0=10^4\nand alpha>1.0 for beta_0=100, where alpha is the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter.

The magnetic dynamo that leads to cyclic flips of\nlarge-scale fields still exists, but becomes more sporadic as net flux\nincreases. For beta_0<10^3, the entire disk becomes magnetic dominated.

For that purpose, we\nuse a set of numerical simulations performed with the MHD code RAMSES in the\nframework of the shearing box model. We concentrate on the case of a rather\nweak vertical magnetic field such that the initial ratio beta0 of the thermal\nand magnetic pressures in the disk midplane equals 10^4. As reported recently,\nwe find that MHD turbulence drives an efficient outflow out of the\ncomputational box. We demonstrate a strong sensitivity of that result to the\nbox size: enlargements in the radial and vertical directions lead to a\nreduction of up to an order of magnitude in the mass-loss rate. Such a\ndependence prevents any realistic estimates of disk mass-loss rates being\nderived using shearing-box simulations. We find however that the flow\nmorphology is robust and independent of the numerical details of the\nsimulations. Its properties display some features and approximate invariants\nthat are reminiscent of the Blandford & Payne launching mechanism, but\ndifferences exist. For the magnetic field strength considered in this paper, we\nalso find that angular momentum transport is most likely dominated by MHD\nturbulence, the saturation of which scales with the magnetic Prandtl number,\nthe ratio of viscosity and resistivity, in a way that is in good agreement with\nexpectations based on unstratified simulations.

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with\nsimpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection\nis started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D. Whether it\nis the primary instability after bounce will ultimately depend on the physical\nseed perturbations present in the cores of massive stars. The gravitational\nwave signal, which we extract and analyze for the first time from 3D\ngeneral-relativistic models, will serve as an observational probe of the\npostbounce dynamics and, in combination with neutrinos, may allow us to\ndetermine the primary hydrodynamic instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 20:29:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 06:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-23"}

We provide a\ncomplete analysis of these NME for the decay of the ground state (g.s.) of\n$^{48}$Ca to the g.s. $0^+_1$ and first excited $0^+_2$ state of $^{48}$Ti.\nMethod: For the analysis we used the nuclear shell model with effective\ntwo-body interactions that were fine-tuned to describe the low-energy\nspectroscopy of $pf$-shell nuclei. We checked our model by calculating the\ntwo-neutrino transition probability to the g.s. of $^{48}$Ti.

The filament eruption was associated\nwith a relatively slow coronal mass ejection (CME). The filament consisted of a\nlarge and a small part, both parts erupted nearly simultaneously. Here we focus\non the eruption associated with the larger part of the filament. The STEREO\nsatellites were separated by about 117 degree during this event, so we\nadditionally used SoHO/EIT and CORONAS/TESIS observations as a third eye (Earth\nview) to aid our measurements. We measure the plane-of-sky trajectory of the\nfilament as seen from STEREO-A and TESIS view-points. Using a simple\ntrigonometric relation, we then use these measurements to estimate the true\ndirection of propagation of the filament which allows us to derive the true\nR=R_sun v/s time profile of the filament apex. Furthermore, we develop a new\ntomographic method that can potentially provide a more robust three-dimensional\nreconstruction by exploiting multiple simultaneous views. We apply this method\nalso to investigate the 3D evolution of the top part of filament. We expect\nthis method to be useful when SDO and STEREO observations are combined. We then\nanalyze the kinematics of the eruptive filament during its rapid acceleration\nphase by fitting different functional forms to the height-time data derived\nfrom the two methods. We find that, for both methods, an exponential function\nfits the rise profile of the filament slightly better than parabolic or cubic\nfunctions. Finally, we confront these results with the predictions of\ntheoretical eruption models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 21:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The method uses the\nmedian of gas properties, such as density and pressure, which we show to be\nvery robust to the presence of gas inhomogeneities. In particular, we show that\nthe radial profiles of median gas properties are smooth and do not exhibit\nfluctuations at locations of massive clumps in contrast to mean and mode\nproperties. It is shown that distribution of gas properties in a given radial\nshell can be well described by a log-normal PDF and a tail. The former\ncorresponds to a nearly hydrostatic bulk component, accounting for ~99% of the\nvolume, while the tail corresponds to high density inhomogeneities. We show\nthat this results in a simple and robust separation of the diffuse and clumpy\ncomponents of the ICM. The FWHM of the density distribution grows with radius\nand varies from ~0.15 dex in cluster centre to ~0.5 dex at 2r_500 in relaxed\nclusters. The small scatter in the width between relaxed clusters suggests that\nthe degree of inhomogeneity is a robust characteristic of the ICM. It broadly\nagrees with the amplitude of density perturbations in the Coma cluster. We\ndiscuss the origin of ICM density variations in spherical shells and show that\nless than 20% of the width can be attributed to the triaxiality of the cluster\ngravitational potential. As a link to X-ray observations of real clusters we\nevaluated the ICM clumping factor with and without high density\ninhomogeneities. We argue that these two cases represent upper and lower limits\non the departure of the observed X-ray emissivity from the median value. We\nfind that the typical value of the clumping factor in the bulk component of\nrelaxed clusters varies from ~1.1-1.2 at r_500 up to ~1.3-1.4 at r_200, in\nbroad agreement with recent observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 23:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

However, large\nN rescaling and the AMPS argument show that black hole complementarity is\ninconsistent. To salvage the basic philosophy of the black hole\ncomplementarity, AMPS introduced a firewall around the horizon. According to\nlarge N rescaling, the firewall should be located close to the apparent\nhorizon. We investigate the consistency of the firewall with the two critical\nconditions: the firewall should be near the time-like apparent horizon and it\nshould not affect the future infinity. Concerning this, we have introduced a\ngravitational collapse with a false vacuum lump which can generate a spacetime\nstructure with disconnected apparent horizons. This reveals a situation that\nthere is a firewall outside of the event horizon, while the apparent horizon is\nabsent.

This alleviates\nthe rigid, single-path formulation of the nCRP, allowing a document to more\neasily express thematic borrowings as a random effect. We derive a stochastic\nvariational inference algorithm for the model, in addition to a greedy subtree\nselection method for each document, which allows for efficient inference using\nmassive collections of text documents.

Y and Z are independent given X, and the link from Z to\nY is lossless with rate $R_0$. A new inequality is introduced to upper-bound\nthe capacity when the encoding rate is beyond the capacities of both individual\nlinks XY and XZ. It is based on generalization of the blowing-up lemma, linking\nconditional entropy to decoding error, and channel simulation, to the case with\nside information. The achieved upper-bound is strictly better than the\nwell-known cut-set bound in several cases when the latter is $C_{XY}+R_0$, with\n$C_{XY}$ being the channel capacity between X and Y. One particular case is\nwhen the channel is statistically degraded, i.e., either Y is a statistically\ndegraded version of Z with respect to X, or Z is a statistically degraded\nversion of Y with respect to X. Moreover in this case, the bound is shown to be\nexplicitly computable. The binary erasure channel is analyzed in detail and\nevaluated numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 05:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-26"}

One approach uses end\ninvariants, such as the number of ends or the fundamental group at infinity;\nanother approach seeks nice compactifications, then analyzes the boundaries. A\nthread connecting the two is shape theory.\n  In these notes we provide a careful development of several topics: homotopy\nand homology properties and invariants for ends of spaces, proper maps and\nhomotopy equivalences, tameness conditions, shapes of ends, and various types\nof Z-compactifications and Z-boundaries.

The $q$-entropic measures fulfill many similar\nproperties to the standard Shannon entropy. In general, both the locality and\nnoncontextuality notions are usually treated with use of the so-called marginal\nscenarios. These hypotheses lead to the existence of a joint probability\ndistribution, which marginalizes to all particular ones. Assuming the existence\nof such a joint probability distribution, we derive the family of inequalities\nof Bell's type in terms of conditional $q$-entropies for all $q\\geq1$. Quantum\nviolations of the new inequalities are exemplified within the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and Klyachko-Can-Binicio\\v{g}lu-Shumovsky\n(KCBS) scenarios. An extension to the case of $n$-cycle scenario is briefly\nmentioned. The new inequalities with conditional $q$-entropies allow to expand\na class of probability distributions, for which the nonlocality or\ncontextuality can be detected within entropic formulation. The $q$-entropic\ninequalities can also be useful in analyzing cases with detection\ninefficiencies.

Due to the popularity of\nmap-based applications among the users, the service provider often requires to\nanswer a large number of simultaneous queries. Thus, processing queries\nefficiently on spatial networks (i.e., road networks) have become an important\nresearch area in recent years. In this paper, we focus on path queries that\nfind the shortest path between a source and a destination of the user. In\nparticular, we address the problem of finding the shortest paths for a large\nnumber of simultaneous path queries in road networks. Traditional systems that\nconsider one query at a time are not suitable for many applications due to high\ncomputational and service costs. These systems cannot guarantee required\nresponse time in high load conditions. We propose an efficient group based\napproach that provides a practical solution with reduced cost. The key concept\nfor our approach is to group queries that share a common travel path and then\ncompute the shortest path for the group. Experimental results show that our\napproach is on an average ten times faster than the traditional approach in\nreturn of sacrificing the accuracy by 0.5% in the worst case, which is\nacceptable for most of the users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 06:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

PVLAS is now\nclose to data-taking and if it reaches the required sensitivity, it could\nprovide important information on QED vacuum. PVLAS and other similar\nexperiments face great challenges as they try to measure an extremely minute\neffect. However, raising the photon energy greatly increases the photon-photon\ncross-section, and gamma rays could help extract much more information from the\nobserved light-light scattering.

In this work, some generic features of the entanglement\nentropy and the two point functions in the ground state of one dimensional\ngapped systems are considered through a tensor network state.

We propose a scheme for\ncharacterizing the room acoustic from the unknown competing speech sources\nrelying on localization of the early images of the speakers by sparse\napproximation of the spatial spectra of the virtual sources in a free-space\nmodel. The images are then clustered exploiting the low-rank structure of the\nspectro-temporal components belonging to each source.

The experiments conducted on real data\nrecordings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for\nmulti-party speech recovery and recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 09:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-26"}

This is a\none-dimensional, discrete analogy of the hydrogen negative ion H$^-$ problem.\nThere are several different types of bound states in this system, each of which\nappears in a specific region. For given $V$, there exists a (positive) critical\nvalue $U_{c1}$ of $U$, below which the ground state is a bound state.\nInterestingly, close to the critical value ($U\\lesssim U_{c1}$), the ground\nstate can be described by the Chandrasekhar-type variational wave function,\nwhich was initially proposed for H$^-$. For $U>U_{c1}$, the ground state is no\nlonger a bound state. However, there exists a second (larger) critical value\n$U_{c2}$ of $U$, above which a molecule-type bound state is established and\nstabilized by the repulsion. We have also tried to solve for the eigenstates of\nthe model using the Bethe ansatz. The model possesses a global $\\Zz_2$-symmetry\n(parity) which allows classification of all eigenstates into even and odd ones.\nIt is found that all states with odd-parity have the Bethe form, but none of\nthe states in the even-parity sector. This allows us to identify analytically\ntwo odd-parity bound states, which appear in the parameter regions $-2V<U<-V$\nand $-V<U<0$, respectively. Remarkably, the latter one can be \\textit{embedded}\nin the continuum spectrum with appropriate parameters. Moreover, in part of\nthese regions, there exists an even-parity bound state accompanying the\ncorresponding odd-parity bound state with almost the same energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 09:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

Several aspects of the physics of this X-ray emission\nremain mysterious, e.g., whether and how much accretion affects coronal\nemission.\n  We studied the X-ray variability of ~1 Myr old low-mass PMS stars as a\nfunction of timescale, stellar rotation, and stellar characteristics, in order\nto gain insights on the working of PMS coronae, their X-ray emission, and the\ncircumstellar environment in which they are immersed.\n  We have exploited the ~850 ksec long Chandra observation of the Orion Nebula\nCluster obtained by the COUP collaboration in Jan. 2003, and statistically\nanalyzed the X-ray lightcurves of low-mass stars in several subsamples. In\nparticular, we characterized the different X-ray behavior of stars with and\nwithout circumstellar accretion disks.\n  Accreting stars (Classical T Tauri Stars, CTTSs) are found to be more\nvariable than non accreting ones (Weak-lined T Tauri Stars, WTTSs) at all\ntimescales and in all the X-ray energy bands considered. Variability is seen to\nincrease with time-scale up to ~10 days, i.e. the longest probed. Signatures of\nrotational modulation are observed for both CTTSs and WTTSs, and most clearly\nfor CTTSs in the soft X-ray band. Lower mass stars are more variable than\nhigher mass ones.\n  We propose that the difference in variability between CTTSs and WTTSs may be\nexplained assuming that the X-ray emission of CTTS is affected by time-variable\nabsorption due circumstellar structures, such as warps in the inner disk and/or\naccretion streams. This suggestion is appealing because, in the hypothesis that\nthe coronae of CTTSs and WTTSs are similar, it may also explain why CTTSs have\nlower and more scattered X-ray emission levels with respect to WTTSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 09:37:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 12:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Here we report on the first direct electronic wavefunction\nprobing in a room-temperature semiconductor. Employing an ultrafast\ncharacterization scheme we have demonstrated Rabi oscillations and self-induced\ntransparency in an electrically driven, room-temperature semiconductor laser\namplifier, revealing the most intimate details of the light-matter interactions\nseen to date. The ability to employ quantum effects in solid-state media, which\noperate at elevated temperatures, will finally bring true quantum mechanical\nconcepts into the realm of practical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 11:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

We have obtained high sensitivity and high\nspectral resolution observations with the IRAM 30m antenna, which allowed us to\nperform detailed analysis of the kinematics within one IRDC, G035.39-00.33. We\nfocus on the 1-0 and 3-2 transitions of N2H+, C18O (1-0), and make comparison\nwith SiO (2-1) observations and extinction mapping. Three interacting filaments\nof gas are found. We report large-scale velocity coherence throughout the\ncloud, evidenced through small velocity gradients and relatively narrow line\nwidths. This suggests that the merging of these filaments is somewhat \"gentle\",\npossibly regulated by magnetic fields. This merging of filaments may be\nresponsible for the weak parsec-scale SiO emission detected by Jimenez-Serra et\nal. 2010, via grain mantle vaporization. A systematic velocity shift between\nthe N2H+ (1-0) and C18O (1-0) gas throughout the cloud of 0.18 +/- 0.04\nkms^{-1} is also found, consistent with a scenario of collisions between\nfilaments which is still ongoing. The N2H+ (1-0) is extended throughout the\nIRDC and it does not only trace dense cores, as found in nearby low-mass\nstar-forming regions. The average H2 number density across the IRDC is ~ 5 x\n10^4 cm^{-3}, at least one order of magnitude larger than in nearby molecular\nclouds where low-mass stars are forming. A temperature gradient perpendicular\nto the filament is found. From our study, we conclude that G035.39-00.33\n(clearly seen in the extinction map and in N2H+) has been formed via the\ncollision between two relatively quiescent filaments with average densities of\n~ 5 x 10^3 cm^{-3}, moving with relative velocities of ~ 5 kms^{-1}.

While BL Lac objects can be\nrather successfully modelled within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)\nscenario, the SED of low peaked Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQ) is more\ndifficult to reproduce. Their high-energy component needs the abundance of\nstrong external photon sources, giving rise to stronger cooling via the inverse\nCompton channel, and thusly to a powerful component in the SED. Recently, we\nwere able to show that such a powerful inverse Compton component can also be\nachieved within the SSC framework. This, however, is only possible if the\nelectrons cool by SSC, which results in a non-linear process, since the cooling\ndepends on an energy integral over the electrons. In this paper we aim to\ncompare the non-linear SSC framework with the external Compton (EC) output by\ncalculating analytically the external Compton component with the underlying\nelectron distribution being either linearly or non-linearly cooled. Due to the\nadditional linear cooling of the electrons with the external photons, higher\nnumber densities of electrons are required to achieve non-linear cooling,\nresulting in more powerful inverse Compton components. If the electrons\ninitially cool non-linearly, the resulting SED can exhibit a dominating SSC\nover the EC component. However, this dominance depends strongly on the input\nparameters. We conclude that with the correct time-dependent treatment the SSC\ncomponent should be taken into account to model blazar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 13:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

First, we examined how users in Wikipedia choose to display (or not\nto display) their political affiliation. Next, we more closely examined the\npatterns of cross-party interaction and community participation among those\nusers proclaiming a political affiliation. In contrast to previous analyses of\nother social media, we did not find strong trends indicating a preference to\ninteract with members of the same political party within the Wikipedia\ncommunity. Our results indicate that users who proclaim their political\naffiliation within the community tend to proclaim their identity as a\n\"Wikipedian\" even more loudly. It seems that the shared identity of \"being\nWikipedian\" may be strong enough to triumph over other potentially divisive\nfacets of personal identity, such as political affiliation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 15:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 18:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 17:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-05"}

The photochemistry\nmodel is designed from the ground up to have the capacity to treat all types of\nterrestrial planet atmospheres, ranging from oxidizing through reducing, which\nmakes the code suitable for applications for the wide range of anticipated\nterrestrial exoplanet compositions. The one-dimensional chemical transport\nmodel treats up to 800 chemical reactions, photochemical processes, dry and wet\ndeposition, surface emission and thermal escape of O, H, C, N and S bearing\nspecies, as well as formation and deposition of elemental sulfur and sulfuric\nacid aerosols. We validate the model by computing the atmospheric composition\nof current Earth and Mars and find agreement with observations of major trace\ngases in Earth's and Mars' atmospheres. We simulate several plausible\natmospheric scenarios of terrestrial exoplanets, and choose three benchmark\ncases for atmospheres from reducing to oxidizing. The most interesting finding\nis that atomic hydrogen is always a more abundant reactive radical than the\nhydroxyl radical in anoxic atmospheres. Whether atomic hydrogen is the most\nimportant removal path for a molecule of interest also depends on the relevant\nreaction rates. We also find that volcanic carbon compounds (i.e., CH4 and CO2)\nare chemically long-lived and tend to be well mixed in both reducing and\noxidizing atmospheres, and their dry deposition velocities to the surface\ncontrol the atmospheric oxidation states. Furthermore, we revisit whether\nphotochemically produced oxygen can cause false positives for detecting\noxygenic photosynthesis, and find that in 1-bar CO2-rich atmospheres oxygen and\nozone may build up to levels that have been previously considered unique\nsignatures of life, if there is no surface emission of reducing gases...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 15:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
