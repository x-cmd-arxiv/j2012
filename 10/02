We also\ncorrelated the GPs at 1.2 GHz with GPs from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank\nTelescope (GBT), which were obtained simultaneously at a higher frequency (8.9\nGHz) over a span of 26 hours.

If ultrarelativistic charged particles channel through\nsuch a crystal, they emit hard radiation of undulator type. A crystalline\nundulator with a bending amplitude smaller than the distance between the bent\nplanes and a bending period shorter than the period of channeling oscillations\nis proposed. Heretofore, it was believed that such a range of bending\nparameters was unsuitable for a crystalline undulator. This point of view is\nrefuted. In fact, the undulator with a small amplitude and a short period is\nfar superior to what was proposed previously. It requires much lower beam\nenergy for production of photons of the same frequency. Such an undulator\nallows for a larger effective number of undulator periods. It is predicted to\nemit intense undulator radiation in the forward direction with a narrow\nspectral distribution and a lower and softer background. The undulator effect\nis seen for both positron and electron beams. Using positrons is, however,\npreferable because they enable one to obtain higher intensity of the undulator\nradiation with lower background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 16:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 07:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 13:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

These AGN have highly variable X-ray light curves that contain\nfrequent, high peaks of emission. The averaged light curve of the peaks is\ndirectly measured from the time series, and it is shown that (i) peaks occur at\nthe same time, within the measurement uncertainties, at all X-ray energies, and\n(ii) there exists a substantial tail of excess emission at hard X-ray energies,\nwhich is delayed with respect to the time of the main peak, and is particularly\nprominent in Ark 564. Observation (i) rules out that the observed lags are\ncaused by Comptonization time delays and disfavors a simple model of\npropagating fluctuations on the accretion disk. Observation (ii) is consistent\nwith time lags caused by Compton-scattering reverberation from material a few\nthousand light-seconds from the primary X-ray source. The power spectral\ndensity and the frequency-dependent phase lags of the peak light curves are\nconsistent with those of the full time series. There is evidence for\nnon-stationarity in the Ark 564 time series in both the Fourier and peaks\nanalyses. A sharp `negative' lag (variations at hard photon energies lead soft\nphoton energies) observed in Ark 564 appears to be generated by the shape of\nthe hard-band transfer function and does not arise from soft-band reflection of\nX-rays. These results reinforce the evidence for the existence of X-ray\nreverberation in type I AGN, which requires that these AGN are significantly\naffected by scattering from circumnuclear material a few tens or hundreds of\ngravitational radii in extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 16:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For the MARC, Wang and Giannakis proposed a\nComplex Field Network Coding (CFNC) scheme. As an alternative, we propose a\nscheme based on Physical layer Network Coding (PNC), which has so far been\nstudied widely only in the context of two-way relaying. For the proposed PNC\nscheme, transmission takes place in two phases: (i) Phase 1 during which $A$\nand $B$ simultaneously transmit and, $R$ and $D$ receive, (ii) Phase 2 during\nwhich $A$, $B$ and $R$ simultaneously transmit to $D$. At the end of Phase 1,\n$R$ decodes the messages $x_A$ of $A$ and $x_B$ of $B,$ and during Phase 2\ntransmits $f(x_A,x_B),$ where $f$ is many-to-one. Communication protocols in\nwhich the relay node decodes are prone to loss of diversity order, due to error\npropagation from the relay node. To counter this, we propose a novel decoder\nwhich takes into account the possibility of an error event at $R$, without\nhaving any knowledge about the links from $A$ to $R$ and $B$ to $R$. It is\nshown that if certain parameters are chosen properly and if the map $f$\nsatisfies a condition called exclusive law, the proposed decoder offers the\nmaximum diversity order of two. Also, it is shown that for a proper choice of\nthe parameters, the proposed decoder admits fast decoding, with the same\ndecoding complexity order as that of the CFNC scheme.

In this paper we address this problem considering a scalar\nfield theory with a general analytic potential having $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry\nand interacting with a quantum gravitational field. The dynamics of the latter\nis governed by the cosmological constant and the Einstein-Hilbert term both\nbeing the lowest and next-to-the lowest terms of the effective theory of\nquantum gravity. Using the Vilkovisky-DeWitt method we calculate the one loop\ncorrection to the scalar field effective action. We also derive the unique one\nloop beta functions for all the scalar field couplings in the MS scheme. We\nfind that the leading gravitational corrections act in the direction of\nasymptotic freedom. Moreover, assuming for both constants the Newton and the\ncosmological to have non-zero fixed point values we find asymptotically free\nHalpern-Huang potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 18:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

In turbulent cloud cores, a\nfilamentary structure appears before the protostar formation and the protostar\nforms in the filament. If the turbulence is initially sufficiently strong, the\nremaining filament twists around the protostar and directly becomes a\nrotation-supported disk. Upon formation, the disk orientation is generally\nmisaligned with the angular momentum of its host cloud core and it dynamically\nvaries during the main accretion phase, even though the turbulence is weak.\nThis is because the angular momentum of the entire cloud core is mainly\ndetermined by the large scale velocity field whose wavelength is comparable to\nthe cloud scale, whereas the angular momentum of the disk is determined by the\nlocal velocity field where the protostar forms and these two velocity fields do\nnot correlate with each other. In the case of disk evolution in a binary or\nmultiple stars, the disks are misaligned with each other at least during the\nmain accretion phase, because there is no correlation between the velocity\nfields around the position where each protostar forms. In addition, each disk\nis also misaligned with the binary orbital plane. Such misalignment can explain\nthe recent observations of misaligned disks and misaligned protostellar\noutflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 19:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

This system raises important\nquestions on the evolution of atmospheres for close-in exoplanets, and the\ndependence with planetary mass and irradiation. These questions can be\naddressed by Lyman-alpha transit observations of the extended hydrogen\nplanetary atmospheres, complemented by contemporaneous measurements of the\nstellar X-ray flux. In fact, planet `e' has been detected in transit,\nsuggesting the system is seen nearly edge-on. Yet, planet `b' has not been\nobserved in transit so far. Here, we report on Hubble Space Telescope STIS\nLyman-alpha and Chandra ACIS-S X-ray observations of 55 Cnc. These simultaneous\nobservations cover two transits of 55 Cnc e and two inferior conjunctions of 55\nCnc b. They reveal the star as a bright Lyman-alpha target and a variable X-ray\nsource. While no significant signal is detected during the transits of 55 Cnc\ne, we detect a surprising Lyman-alpha absorption of 7.5 +/- 1.8% (4.2 sigma) at\ninferior conjunctions of 55 Cnc b. The absorption is only detected over the\nrange of Doppler velocities where the stellar radiation repels hydrogen atoms\ntowards the observer. We calculate a false-alarm probability of 4.4%, which\ntakes into account the a-priori unknown transit parameters. This result\nsuggests the possibility that 55 Cnc b has an extended upper H I atmosphere,\nwhich undergoes partial transits when the planet grazes the stellar disc. If\nconfirmed, it would show that planets cooler than hot Jupiters can also have\nextended atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

These findings imply that the standard approximation\nof exponentially declining SFHs widely used to interpret observed galaxy\nspectral energy distributions may not be appropriate to constrain the physical\nparameters of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 20:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 21:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

While disc\nproperties can be inferred from unresolved photometry alone under various\nassumptions for the physical properties of dust grains, there is a degeneracy\nbetween disc radius and dust temperature that depends on the grain size\ndistribution and optical properties. By resolving the disc we can measure the\nactual location of the dust. The launch of Herschel, with an angular resolution\nsuperior to previous far-infrared telescopes, allows us to spatially resolve\nmore discs and locate the dust directly. Here we present the nine resolved\ndiscs around A stars between 20 and 40 pc observed by the DEBRIS survey. We use\nthese data to investigate the disc radii by fitting narrow ring models to\nimages at 70, 100 and 160 {\\mu}m and by fitting blackbodies to full spectral\nenergy distributions. We do this with the aim of finding an improved way of\nestimating disc radii for unresolved systems. The ratio between the resolved\nand blackbody radii varies between 1 and 2.5. This ratio is inversely\ncorrelated with luminosity and any remaining discrepancies are most likely\nexplained by differences to the minimum size of grain in the size distribution\nor differences in composition. We find that three of the systems are well fit\nby a narrow ring, two systems are borderline cases and the other four likely\nrequire wider or multiple rings to fully explain the observations, reflecting\nthe diversity of planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 20:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}

Multi-lepton signals of 2HDMs can arise from a variety of\nsources, including Standard Model-like production of the CP-even scalars, $h$\nand $H$, through gluon-fusion with $h,H \\to ZZ^{(*)}$, or associated production\nwith vector bosons or top quarks, with $h,H \\to WW^{(*)}, ZZ^{(*)},\\tau\\tau$.\nAdditional sources include gluon-fusion production of the heavy CP-even scalar\nwith decays through the light CP-even scalar, the CP-odd scalar, $A$, or the\ncharged scalar, $H^\\pm$, such as $H \\to hh$, $H \\to AA$, $H \\to H^+ H^-$, $H\n\\to ZA$, with $A \\to Zh, \\tau\\tau$, $H^\\pm \\to Wh$, and $h \\to WW^*,\nZZ^*,\\tau\\tau$. Altogether, the combined multi-lepton signal may greatly exceed\nthat of the Standard Model Higgs boson and provides a sensitive probe of\nextended Higgs sectors. As a proof of principle, we use a factorized mapping\nprocedure between model parameters and signatures to determine multi-lepton\nsensitivities in four different flavor conserving 2HDM parameter spaces by\nsimulating the acceptance times efficiency in 20 exclusive multi-lepton\nchannels for 222 independent production and decay topologies that arise for\nfour benchmark 2HDM spectra within each parameter space. A comparison of these\nsensitivities with the results of a multi-lepton search conducted by the CMS\ncollaboration using 5 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected from 7 TeV $pp$ collisions\nyields new limits in regions of 2HDM parameter space that have not previously\nbeen covered by other types of direct experimental searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 20:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We focus on\nthe ionisation state of the gas, size and luminosity of extended narrow line\nregions (ENLRs), which corresponds to those parts of the EELR dominated by\nionisation from the QSO, as well as the kinematics of the ionised gas. We\ndetect EELRs around 19 of our 31 QSOs (61%) after deblending the unresolved QSO\nemission and the extended host galaxy light in the integral field data. We\nidentify 13 EELRs to be entirely ionised by the QSO radiation, 3 EELRs are\ncomposed of HII regions and 3 EELRs display signatures of both ionisation\nmechanisms at different locations. The typical size of the ENLR is 10kpc at a\nmedian nuclear [OIII] luminosity of log(L([OIII])/[erg/s])=42.7+-0.15.

Furthermore, we show for the first time that the\nENLR size is much better correlated with the QSO continuum luminosity than with\nthe total/nuclear [OIII] luminosity. We show that ENLR luminosity and radio\nluminosity are correlated, and argue that radio jets even in radio-quiet QSOs\nare important for shaping the properties of the ENLR. Strikingly, the\nkinematics of the ionised gas is quiescent and likely gravitationally driven in\nthe majority of cases and we find only 3 objects with radial gas velocities\nexceeding 400km/s in specific regions of the EELR that can be associate with\nradio jets.

If a reduced basis (RB) or any other\nprojection-based model reduction technique is applied, the dimensionality of\nintegrands is reduced dramatically; however, the cost of approximating the\nintegrands by projection still scales as the size of the original problem. In\ncontrast, using discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) points as ROQ nodes\nleads to a computational cost which depends linearly on the dimension of the\nreduced space. Generation of a reduced basis via a greedy procedure requires a\ntraining set, which for products of functions can be very large. Since this\ndirect approach can be impractical in many applications, we propose instead a\ntwo-step greedy targeted towards approximation of such products. We present\nnumerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and the efficiency of the\ntwo-step approach. The presented ROQ are expected to display very fast\nconvergence whenever there is regularity with respect to parameter variation.\nWe find that for the particular application here considered, one driven by\ngravitational wave physics, the two-step approach speeds up the offline\ncomputations to build the ROQ by more than two orders of magnitude.\nFurthermore, the resulting ROQ rule is found to converge exponentially with the\nnumber of nodes, and a factor of ~50 savings, without loss of accuracy, is\nobserved in evaluations of inner products when ROQ are used as a downsampling\nstrategy for equidistant samples using the trapezoidal rule. While the primary\nfocus of this paper is on quadrature rules for inner products of parameterized\nfunctions, our method can be easily adapted to integrations of single\nparameterized functions, and some examples of this type are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 21:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 May 2013 07:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-22"}

Therefore, the quantum entanglement properties\ninvolving an infinite chain structure is quite important, not only because the\nmathematical calculation is cumbersome but also because real materials are well\nrepresented by an infinite chain. Thus, in this paper we consider an entangled\ndiamond chain with Ising and anisotropic Heisenberg (Ising-XXZ) coupling. Two\ninterstitial particles are coupled through Heisenberg coupling or simply\ntwo-qubit Heisenberg, which could be responsible for the emergence of\nentanglement. These two-qubit Heisenberg operators are interacted with two\nnodal Ising spins. An infinite diamond chain is organized by\ninterstitial-interstitial and nodal-interstitial (dimer-monomer) site\ncouplings. We are able to get the thermal average of the two-qubit operator,\ncalled the reduced two-qubit density operator. Since these density operators\nare spatially separated, we could obtain the concurrence (entanglement)\ndirectly in the thermodynamic limit. The thermal entanglement (concurrence) is\nconstructed for different values of the anisotropic Heisenberg parameter,\nmagnetic field and temperature. We also observed the threshold temperature via\nthe parameter of anisotropy, Heisenberg and Ising interaction, external\nmagnetic field, and temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 22:24:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 17:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-30"}

As a consequence of\nthis fact the tachyonic field $T$ turns out to be complex in contradiction with\nthe real nature of the starting action for the tachyonic braneworld. Conversely\nif one requires to have a real tachyon field, 4d gravity will not be localized\nand the effective gravitational coupling will be infinite. We present several\ntypical examples where this problem occurs: we have analysed this situation for\nthin as well as thick tachyonic braneworlds with 4d Poincare symmetry, for the\ncase when a bulk cosmological constant is present, and even for a brane with an\ninduced spatially flat 4d cosmological background, and shown that in all cases\nthe tachyon field T comes out to be inconsistently complex when imposing\nlocalization of 4d gravity. On the other hand, when dealing with a further\nreduction of the hierarchy problem one should carefully consider the sign of\nthe constants c_1 and c_2 to avoid inconsistencies in the tachyonic braneworld\nmodel.

Even\nthough various models have been proposed to determine the onset of solar\neruptions, the types of magnetic structures capable of triggering these\neruptions are still unclear. In this study, we solved this problem by\nsystematically surveying the nonlinear dynamics caused by a wide variety of\nmagnetic structures in terms of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations. As a result, we determined that two different types of small\nmagnetic structures favor the onset of solar eruptions.

Here we employ ray-tracing N-body simulations in which we manually\nsteepen the density profile of each dark matter halo, mimicking the cooling and\nconcentration of baryons into dark matter potential wells. We find, in\nagreement with previous works, that this causes a significant increase in the\namplitude of the WL power spectrum on small scales (spherical harmonic index\nl>1,000). We then study the impact of the halo concentration increase on the\npeak counts, and find the following. (i) Low peaks (with convergence 0.02 <\nkappa_peak < 0.08), remain nearly unaffected. These peaks are created by a\nconstellation of several halos with low masses (10^12-10^13 M_sun) and large\nangular offsets from the peak center (> 0.5 R_vir); as a result, they are\ninsensitive to the central halo density profiles. These peaks contain most of\nthe cosmological information, and thus provide an unusually sensitive and\nunbiased probe. (ii) The number of high peaks (with convergence kappa_peak >\n0.08) is increased. However, when the baryon effects are neglected in\ncosmological parameter estimation, then the high peaks lead to a modest bias,\ncomparable to that from the power spectrum on relatively large-scales (l<2000),\nand much smaller than the bias from the power spectrum on smaller scales\n(l>2,000). (iii) In the 3D parameter space (sigma_8, Omega_m, w), the biases\nfrom the high peaks and the power spectra are in different directions.

Quantum\nentanglement plays a fundamental role in many applications of quantum\ninformation theory, such as quantum teleportation. Stochastic local quantum\noperations and classical communication (SLOCC) cannot essentially change\nquantum entanglement without destroying it. Therefore, entanglement can be\nclassified by dividing quantum states into equivalence classes, where two\nstates are equivalent if each can be converted into the other by SLOCC.\nProperties of this classification, especially in the case of non\ntwo-dimensional quantum systems, have not been well studied. Graphical\nrepresentation is sometimes used to clarify the nature and structural features\nof entangled states. SLOCC equivalence of quantum bits (qubits) has been\ndescribed graphically via a connection between tripartite entangled qubit\nstates and commutative Frobenius algebras (CFAs) in monoidal categories. In\nthis paper, we extend this method to qutrits, i.e., systems that have three\nbasis states. We examine the correspondence between CFAs and tripartite\nentangled qutrits. Using the symmetry property, which is required by the\ndefinition of a CFA, we find that there are only three equivalence classes that\ncorrespond to CFAs. We represent qutrits graphically, using the connection to\nCFAs. We derive equations that characterize the three equivalence classes.\nMoreover, we show that any qutrit can be represented as a composite of three\ngraphs that correspond to the three classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 00:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

The\ncorresponding initial-value problems are solved by finding the eigenvalues of a\ntime-dependent $N\\times N$ matrix $U(t)$ explicitly defined in terms of the\ninitial positions and velocities of the $N$ particles. Some of these models are\nasymptotically isochronous, i.e. in the remote future they become completely\nperiodic with a period $T$ independent of the initial data (up to exponentially\nvanishing corrections). Alternative formulations of these models, obtained by\nchanging the dependent variables from the $N$ zeros of a monic polynomial of\ndegree $N$ to its $N$ coefficients, are also exhibited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 05:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

Security concerns that arise when outsourcing data and computation\nto the cloud include data confidentiality and privacy. Given that a tremendous\namount of data is being generated everyday from plethora of devices equipped\nwith sensing capabilities, we focus on the problem of access controls over live\nstreams of data based on triggers or sliding windows, which is a distinct and\nmore challenging problem than access control over archival data. Specifically,\nwe investigate secure mechanisms for outsourcing access control enforcement for\nstream data to the cloud. We devise a system that allows data owners to specify\nfine-grained policies associated with their data streams, then to encrypt the\nstreams and relay them to the cloud for live processing and storage for future\nuse. The access control policies are enforced by the cloud, without the latter\nlearning about the data, while ensuring that unauthorized access is not\nfeasible. To realize these ends, we employ a novel cryptographic primitive,\nnamely proxy-based attribute-based encryption, which not only provides security\nbut also allows the cloud to perform expensive computations on behalf of the\nusers. Our approach is holistic, in that these controls are integrated with an\nXML based framework (XACML) for high-level management of policies. Experiments\nwith our prototype demonstrate the feasibility of such mechanisms, and early\nevaluations suggest graceful scalability with increasing numbers of policies,\ndata streams and users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 06:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

We studied ER\nUMa-type dwarf novae and found that V1159 Ori showed positive superhumps\nsimilar to ER UMa in the 1990s. The recently recognized ER UMa-type object BK\nLyn dominantly showed negative superhumps, and its behavior was very similar to\nthe present-day state of ER UMa. The pattern of period variations in AM\nCVn-type objects were very similar to short-period hydrogen-rich SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae, making them helium analogue of hydrogen-rich SU UMa-type dwarf\nnovae. SBS 1108+574, a peculiar hydrogen-rich dwarf nova below the period\nminimum, showed a very similar pattern of period variations to those of\nshort-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae.

Ambipolar diffusion (AD) is considered\none of the most important heating mechanisms in weakly ionized molecular\nclouds. In this work, we study the AD heating rate using 2-fluid turbulence\nsimulations and compare it with the overall heating rate due to turbulent\ndissipation. We find that for observed molecular clouds, which typically have\nAlfven Mach numbers of ~1 (Crutcher 1999) and AD Reynolds numbers of ~20 (McKee\net al. 2010), about 70% of the total turbulent dissipation is in the form of AD\nheating. AD has an important effect on the length scale where energy is\ndissipated: when AD heating is strong, most of the energy in the cascade is\nremoved by ion-neutral drift, with a comparatively small amount of energy\nmaking it down to small scales. We derive a relation for the AD heating rate\nthat describes the results of our simulations to within a factor of two.\nTurbulent dissipation, including AD heating, is generally less important that\ncosmic-ray heating in molecular clouds, although there is substantial scatter\nin both.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 08:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Delving into this\nframework, a thick braneworld with a cosmological background induced on the\nbrane is here investigated. The respective field equations --- derived from the\nmodel with a warped 5D geometry --- are highly non-linear equations, admitting\na non-trivial solution for the warp factor and the tachyon scalar field as\nwell, in a de Sitter 4D cosmological background. Moreover, the non-linear\ntachyonic scalar field, that generates the brane in complicity with warped\ngravity, has the form of a kink-like configuration. Notwithstanding, the\nnon-linear field equations restricting character does not allow one to easily\nfind thick brane solutions with a decaying warp factor which leads to the\nlocalization of 4D gravity and other matter fields. We derive such a thick\nbrane configuration altogether in this tachyon-gravity setup. When analyzing\nthe spectrum of gravity fluctuations in the transverse traceless sector, the 4D\ngravity is shown to be localized due to the presence of a {\\it single} zero\nmode bound state, separated by a continuum of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes\nby a mass gap. It contrasts with previous results, where there is a KK massive\nbound excitation providing no clear physical interpretation. The mass gap is\ndetermined by the scale of the metric parameter $H$. Finally, the corrections\nto Newton's law in this model are computed and shown to decay exponentially. It\nis in full compliance to corrections reported in previous results (up to a\nconstant factor) within similar braneworlds with induced 4D de Sitter metric,\ndespite the fact that the warp factor and the massive modes have a different\nform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 10:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2013 01:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-28"}

Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is a major cause of morbidity and\nmortality. [...] Biomedical literature mining can aid DDI research by\nextracting relevant DDI signals from either the published literature or large\nclinical databases. However, though drug interaction is an ideal area for\ntranslational research, the inclusion of literature mining methodologies in DDI\nworkflows is still very preliminary. One area that can benefit from literature\nmining is the automatic identification of a large number of potential DDIs,\nwhose pharmacological mechanisms and clinical significance can then be studied\nvia in vitro pharmacology and in populo pharmaco-epidemiology. Experiments. We\nimplemented a set of classifiers for identifying published articles relevant to\nexperimental pharmacokinetic DDI evidence. These documents are important for\nidentifying causal mechanisms behind putative drug-drug interactions, an\nimportant step in the extraction of large numbers of potential DDIs. We\nevaluate performance of several linear classifiers on PubMed abstracts, under\ndifferent feature transformation and dimensionality reduction methods.

For some classifiers, such as linear\ndiscriminant analysis (LDA), proper dimensionality reduction had a large impact\non performance.

A key reason is that the presence of a fixed\nminimum length would seem to contradict the ability of Lorentz transformations\nto contract lengths. In this paper, we implement a fully covariant Planck scale\ncutoff by cutting off the spectrum of the d'Alembertian. In this scenario,\nconsistent with Lorentz contractions, wavelengths that are arbitrarily smaller\nthan the Planck length continue to exist. However, the dynamics of modes of\nwavelengths that are significantly smaller than the Planck length possess a\nvery small bandwidth. This has the effect of freezing the dynamics of such\nmodes. While both, wavelengths and bandwidths, are frame dependent, Lorentz\ncontraction and time dilation conspire to make the freezing of modes of\ntransplanckian wavelengths covariant. In particular, we show that this\nultraviolet cutoff can be implemented covariantly also in curved spacetimes. We\nfocus on Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) spacetimes and their much-discussed\ntransplanckian question: The physical wavelength of each comoving mode was\nsmaller than the Planck scale at sufficiently early times. What was the mode's\ndynamics then? Here, we show that in the presence of the covariant UV cutoff,\nthe dynamical bandwidth of a comoving mode is essentially zero up until its\nphysical wavelength starts exceeding the Planck length. In particular, we show\nthat under general assumptions, the number of dynamical degrees of freedom of\neach comoving mode all the way up to some arbitrary finite time is actually\nfinite. Our results also open the way to calculating the impact of this natural\nUV cutoff on inflationary predictions for the CMB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 12:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

A\ntwo-component recursion generates the in-medium T-matrix at any order when\noff-shell terms spoil the factorization of multi-loop diagrams. The resummation\nto all orders is achieved in the form of a geometrical series for the\nparticle-particle ladders, and through an arctangent-function for the combined\nparticle-particle and hole-hole ladders. One finds that the effective range\ncorrection changes the results in the limit of large scattering length\nconsiderably, with the effect that the Bertsch parameter $\\xi_n$ nearly\ndoubles. Applications to the equation of state of neutron matter at low density\nare also discussed.

Methods: We\nused a modern ZDI code employing a physically realistic treatment of the\npolarized radiative transfer in all four Stokes parameters. We generated\nartificial observations of isolated magnetic spots and of magnetic features\ncoinciding with cool temperature spots and then reconstructed magnetic and\ntemperature distributions from these data. Results: Using Stokes I and V for\nsimultaneous magnetic and temperature mapping for the star with a homogeneous\ntemperature distribution yields magnetic field strengths underestimated by\ntypically 10-15% relative to their true values. When temperature is kept\nconstant and Stokes I is not used for magnetic mapping, the underestimation is\n30-60%. At the same time, the strength of magnetic field inside cool spots is\nunderestimated by as much as 80-95% and the spot geometry is also poorly\nreconstructed when temperature variations are ignored. On the other hand, the\ninversion quality is greatly improved when temperature variations are accounted\nfor in magnetic mapping. When using all four Stokes parameters the\nreconstructed field strength inside cool spots is underestimated by 30-40% but\nthe spot geometry can be recovered very accurately compared to the experiments\nwith circular polarization alone. Conclusions: Reliable magnetic field\nreconstruction for a star with high-contrast temperature spots is essentially\nimpossible if temperature inhomogeneities are ignored. A physically realistic\nline profile modeling method, which simultaneously accounts for both types of\ninhomogeneities, is required for meaningful ZDI of cool active stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 14:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

Some online social networks have become\nextremely popular in the last decade. They differ among themselves in the\ncharacter of the service they provide to online users. For instance, Facebook\ncan be seen mainly as a platform for keeping in touch with close friends and\nrelatives, Twitter is used to propagate and receive news, LinkedIn facilitates\nthe maintenance of professional contacts, Flickr gathers amateurs and\nprofessionals of photography, etc. Albeit different, all these online platforms\nshare an ingredient that pervades all their applications. There exists an\nunderlying social network that allows their users to keep in touch with each\nother and helps to engage them in common activities or interactions leading to\na better fulfillment of the service's purposes. This is the reason why these\nplatforms share a good number of functionalities, e.g., personal communication\nchannels, broadcasted status updates, easy one-step information sharing, news\nfeeds exposing broadcasted content, etc. As a result, online social networks\nare an interesting field to study an online social behavior that seems to be\ngeneric among the different online services. Since at the bottom of these\nservices lays a network of declared relations and the basic interactions in\nthese platforms tend to be pairwise, a natural methodology for studying these\nsystems is provided by network science. In this chapter we describe some of the\nresults of research studies on the structure, dynamics and social activity in\nonline social networks. We present them in the interdisciplinary context of\nnetwork science, sociological studies and computer science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 15:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

In this article, we present a\ncomprehensive review of Hall effect measurements in the heavy-fermion\nmaterials, and examine the success it has had in contributing to our current\nunderstanding of strongly correlated matter. Particular emphasis is placed on\nits utility in the investigation of quantum critical phenomena which are\nthought to drive many of the exotic electronic ground states in these systems.\nThis is achieved by the description of measurements of the Hall effect across\nthe putative zero-temperature instability in the archetypal heavy-fermion metal\nYbRh$_2$Si$_2$. Using the Ce$M$In$_5$ (with $M =$ Co, Ir) family of systems as\na paradigm, the influence of (antiferro-)magnetic fluctuations on the Hall\neffect is also illustrated. This is compared to prior Hall effect measurements\nin the cuprates and other strongly correlated systems to emphasize on the\ngenerality of the unusual magnetotransport in materials with non-Fermi liquid\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Oct 2012 15:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-18"}

From the\nmerger tree of ionized patches, one can track the individual evolution of the\nregions properties such as e.g. their size, or the intensity of the percolation\nprocess by looking at the formation rate, the frequency of mergers and the\nnumber of individual HII regions involved in the mergers. We apply the merger\ntree technique to simulations of reionization with three different kinds of\nionizing source models and two resolutions. Two of them use star particles as\nionizing sources. In this case we confront two emissivity evolutions for the\nsources in order to reach the reionization at z ~ 6. As an alternative we built\na semi-analytical model where the dark matter halos extracted from the density\nfields are assumed as ionizing sources. We then show how this methodology is a\ngood candidate to quantify the impact of the adopted star formation on the\nhistory of the observed reionization. The semi-analytical model shows a\nhomogeneous reionization history with 'local' hierarchical growth steps for\nindividual HII regions. On the other hand auto-consistent models for star\nformation tend to present fewer regions with a dominant region in size which\ngoverns the fusion process early in the reionization at the expense of the\n'local' reionizations.
