The first property is the approximate scaling\nrelation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by\ntheir relative fractions in the nucleus. The second property is the inverse\nproportionality of the strength of the high-momentum distribution of protons\nand neutrons to the same relative fractions. Based on these two properties the\nhigh-momentum distribution function for asymmetric nuclei has been modeled and\ndemonstrated that it describes reasonably well the high-momentum\ncharacteristics of light nuclei. However, the most surprising result is\nobtained for neutron rich nuclei with large A, for which a substantial relative\nabundance of high-momentum protons as compared to neutrons is predicted. For\nexample, the model predicts that in Au the relative fraction of protons with\nmomenta above $k_{F} \\sim 260$~MeV/c is 50% more than that of neutrons. Such a\nsituation may have many implications for different observations in nuclear\nphysics related to the properties of a proton in neutron rich nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 16:04:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 18:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 03:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

Under the hypothesis\nthat many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that\nthese SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become\ncommon to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To exploit the\nmechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved\nunderstanding of the genetic architecture and cell type specificity of eQTLs is\nrequired. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in four parts:\nfirst we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; next we\nquantified cell type specific eQTLs across the studies; then we integrated eQTL\ndata with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data sets from the ENCODE project;\nfinally we built a classifier to predict cell type specific eQTLs.

Matter\npower spectrum over these scales are effectively probed by cosmological\nobservables such as shear correlation and Ly-alpha clouds, In this paper we\ndiscuss the implications of primordial magnetic fields on the distribution of\nLy-alpha clouds. We simulate the line of sight density fluctuation including\nthe contribution coming from the primordial magnetic fields. We compute the\nevolution of Ly-alpha opacity for this case and compare our theoretical\nestimates of Ly-alpha opacity with the existing data to constrain the\nparameters of the primordial magnetic fields. We also discuss the case when the\ntwo density fields are correlated. Our analysis yields an upper bounds of\nroughly 0.3-0.6 nG on the magnetic field strength for a range of nearly scale\ninvariant models, corresponding to magnetic field power spectrum index n \\simeq\n-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 16:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Oct 2012 07:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We find that the poleward\nmeridional flow decreases in amplitude with time lag and reverses direction to\nbecome an equatorward return flow at time lags > 24 hours. These\ncross-correlation results are dominated by larger and deeper cells at longer\ntime lags. (The smaller cells have shorter lifetimes and do not contribute to\nthe correlated signal at longer time lags.) We determine the characteristic\ncell size associated with each time lag by comparing the equatorial zonal flows\nmeasured at different time lags with the zonal flows associated with different\ncell sizes from a Fourier analysis. This association gives a characteristic\ncell size of ~50 Mm at a 24 hour time lag. This indicates that the poleward\nmeridional flow returns equatorward at depths > 50 Mm -- just below the base of\nthe surface shear layer. A substantial and highly significant equatorward flow\n(4.6 +/- 0.4 m/s) is found at a time lag of 28 hours corresponding to a depth\nof ~70 Mm.

Magnetic reconnection in this current sheet\ninevitably dissipates a nontrivial fraction of the pulsar spin-down power\nwithin a few LC radii. We develop a basic physical picture of reconnection in\nthis environment and discuss its implications for the observed pulsed gamma-ray\nemission. We argue that reconnection proceeds in the plasmoid-dominated regime,\nvia an hierarchical chain of multiple secondary islands/flux ropes. The\ninter-plasmoid reconnection layers are subject to strong synchrotron cooling,\nleading to significant plasma compression. Using the conditions of pressure\nbalance across these current layers, the balance between the heating by\nmagnetic energy dissipation and synchrotron cooling, and Ampere's law, we\nobtain simple estimates for key parameters of the layers --- temperature,\ndensity, and layer thickness. In the comoving frame of the relativistic pulsar\nwind just outside of the equatorial current sheet, these basic parameters are\nuniquely determined by the strength of the reconnecting upstream magnetic\nfield. For the case of the Crab pulsar, we find them to be of order 10 GeV,\n$10^{13} cm^{-3}$, and 10 cm, respectively. After accounting for the bulk\nDoppler boosting due to the pulsar wind, the synchrotron and inverse-Compton\nemission from the reconnecting current sheet can explain the observed pulsed\nhigh-energy (GeV) and VHE (~100 GeV) radiation, respectively. Also, we suggest\nthat the rapid relative motions of the secondary plasmoids in the hierarchical\nchain may contribute to the production of the pulsar radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 19:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Joined with high\nnumerical resolution of 3.8 pc, the realistic description of stellar feedback\nhelps to self-regulate star formation. This new feedback scheme also enables us\nto study the escape of ionizing photons from star-forming clumps and from a\ngalaxy, and to examine the evolving environment of star-forming gas clumps. By\nsimulating a galactic disk in a halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find that the average\nescape fraction from all radiating sources on the spiral arms (excluding the\ncentral 2.5 kpc) fluctuates between 0.08% and 5.9% during a ~20 Myr period with\na mean value of 1.1%. The flux of escaped photons from these sources is not\nstrongly beamed, but manifests a large opening angle of more than 60 degree\nfrom the galactic pole. Further, we investigate the escape fraction per SFMC\nparticle, f_esc(i), and how it evolves as the particle ages. We discover that\nthe average escape fraction f_esc is dominated by a small number of SFMC\nparticles with high f_esc(i). On average, the escape fraction from a SFMC\nparticle rises from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particle\nlifetime, 6 Myrs. This is because SFMC particles drift away from the dense gas\nclumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-forming\nclumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback.

Combining\nRHESSI with simultaneous SDO/AIA observations, it is possible for the first\ntime to determine the density, temperature, and emission profile of the solar\natmosphere over a wide range of heights during a flare, using two independent\nmethods. Here we analyze a near limb event during the first of three hard X-ray\npeaks. The emission measure, temperature, and density of the coronal source is\nfound using soft X-ray RHESSI images while the chromospheric density is\ndetermined using RHESSI visibility analysis of the hard X-ray footpoints. A\nregularized inversion technique is applied to AIA images of the flare to find\nthe differential emission measure (DEM). Using DEM maps we determine the\nemission and temperature structure of the loop, as well as the density, and\ncompare it with RHESSI results. The soft X-ray and hard X-ray sources are\nspatially coincident with the top and bottom of the EUV loop, but the bulk of\nthe EUV emission originates from a region without co-spatial RHESSI emission.\nThe temperature analysis along the loop indicates that the hottest plasma is\nfound near the coronal loop top source. The EUV observations suggest that the\ndensity in the loop legs increases with increasing height while the temperature\nremains constant within uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 20:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

These methods\nestimate the winding rate by finding the values for a set of parameters that\ncorrespond to the minimum of the discrepancy between magnetic-field\nmeasurements and predictions from a twisted flux-tube model. For the flux-tube\nmodel used in the fitting, we assume that the magnetic field is static,\naxisymmetric, and does not vary in the vertical direction. Using error-free,\nsynthetic vector magnetic-field data constructed with models for twisted\nmagnetic-flux tubes, we test the efficacy of fitting methods at recovering the\ntrue winding rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how assumptions built into the\nflux-tube models used for the fitting influence the accuracy of the\nwinding-rate estimates. We identify the radial variation of the winding rate\nwithin the flux tube as one assumption that can have a significant impact on\nthe winding-rate estimates. We show that the errors caused by making a fixed,\nincorrect assumption about the radial variation of the winding rate can be\nlargely avoided by fitting directly for the radial variation of the winding\nrate. Other assumptions that we investigate include the lack of variation of\nthe field in the azimuthal and vertical directions in the flux tube model used\nfor the fitting, and the inclination, curvature, and location of the flux-tube\naxis. When the observed field deviates substantially from the flux-tube model\nused for the fitting, we find that the winding-rate estimates can be\nunreliable. We conclude that the magnetic-flux tube models used in this\ninvestigation are probably too simple to yield reliable estimates for the\nwinding rate of the field lines in solar magnetic structures in general, unless\nadditional information is available to justify the choice of flux-tube model\nused for the fitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2012 20:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-15"}

Our distillation circuit is based on a family of concatenated quantum\ncodes that possess a transversal Hadamard operation, enabling each of these\ncodes to distill the eigenstate of the Hadamard operator. A crucial result of\nthis design is that low-fidelity magic states can be consumed to purify other\nhigh-fidelity magic states to even higher fidelity, which we call \"multilevel\ndistillation.\" When distilling in the asymptotic regime of infidelity $\\epsilon\n\\rightarrow 0$ for each input magic state, the number of input magic states\nconsumed on average to yield an output state with infidelity\n$O(\\epsilon^{2^r})$ approaches $2^r+1$, which comes close to saturating the\nconjectured bound in [Phys.

This,\nhowever, is contingent on our ability to confidently perform chemical tagging\non such a large data-set. Chemical homogeneity has been observed across a range\nof elements within several Galactic open clusters, yet the level to which this\nis the case globally, and particularly in comparison to the scatter across\nclusters themselves, is not well understood. The patterns of elements in coeval\ncluster members, occupying a complex chemical abundance space, are rooted in\nthe evolution, ultimately the nature of the very late stages, of early\ngenerations of stars. The current astrophysical models of such stages are not\nyet sufficient to explain all observations, combining with our significant gaps\nin the understanding of star formation, makes this a difficult arena to tackle\ntheoretically. Here, we describe a robust pair-wise metric used to gauge the\nchemical difference between two stellar components. This metric is then applied\nto a database of high-resolution literature abundance sources to derive a\nfunction describing the probability that two stars are of common evolutionary\norigin. With this cluster probability function, it will be possible to report a\nconfidence, grounded in empirical observational evidence, with which clusters\nare detected, independent of the group finding methods. This formulation is\nalso used to probe the role of chemical dimensionality, and that of individual\nchemical species, on the ability of chemical tagging to differentiate coeval\ngroups of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2012 01:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Sensitivity values are\nimportant in the analysis, modeling and design of chemical networks. They help\nin understanding the robustness properties of the system and also in\nidentifying the key reactions for a given outcome. In a discrete setting, most\nof the methods that exist in the literature for the estimation of parameter\nsensitivities rely on Monte Carlo simulations along with finite difference\ncomputations. However these methods introduce a bias in the sensitivity\nestimate and in most cases the size or direction of the bias remains unknown,\npotentially damaging the accuracy of the analysis. In this paper, we use the\nrandom time change representation of Kurtz to derive an exact formula for\nparameter sensitivity. This formula allows us to construct an unbiased\nestimator for parameter sensitivity, which can be efficiently evaluated using a\nsuitably devised Monte Carlo scheme. The existing literature contains only one\nmethod to produce such an unbiased estimator. This method was proposed by\nPlyasunov and Arkin and it is based on the Girsanov measure transformation. By\ntaking a couple of examples we compare our method to this existing method. Our\nresults indicate that our method can be much faster than the existing method\nwhile computing sensitivity with respect to a reaction rate constant which is\nsmall in magnitude. This rate constant could correspond to a reaction which is\nslow in the reference time-scale of the system. Since many biological systems\nhave such slow reactions, our method can be a useful tool for sensitivity\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2012 10:57:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 13:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}

By applying PDR modeling we derive maps of the\nmain ISM physical parameters, including the [CII] optical depth, at\nunprecedented spatial resolution (~300 pc). We can clearly kinematically\nseparate the disk from the outflow in all lines. The [CII] and [OI]\ndistributions are consistent with PDR emission both in the disk and in the\noutflow. Surprisingly, in the outflow, the atomic and the ionized gas traced by\nthe [OIII] line both have a deprojected velocity of ~75 km/s, very similar to\nthe average velocity of the outflowing cold molecular gas (~ 100 km/s) and\nseveral times smaller than the outflowing material detected in Halpha (~ 600\nkm/s). This suggests that the cold molecular and neutral atomic gas and the\nionized gas traced by the [OIII] 88 micron line are dynamically coupled to each\nother but decoupled from the Halpha emitting gas.

In\naddition, for the downlink, we find the condition to determine whether\nsuperposition coding with excess data over the better link and network coded\ndata for both users is energy efficient and the corresponding optimization is\nformulated and solved. To tackle the queue evolution in this network, we\npresent a detailed analysis of the queues at each node using a random\nscheduling method that closely approximates the theoretical design, through a\ntwo-dimensional Markov chain model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2012 13:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Oct 2012 03:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-29"}

We consider a two-component\naccretion flow in which the Keplerian disk is immersed into an accreting\nlow-angular momentum flow (halo) around a black hole.

We show that as a result of Comptonization of the Compton cloud, the\ncloud becomes cooler with the increase in the Keplerian disk rate. As the\nresultant thermal pressure is reduced, the post-shock region collapses and the\noutflow rate is also reduced. Since the hard radiation is produced from the\npost-shock region, and the spectral slope increases with the reduction of the\nelectron temperature, the cooling produces softer spectrum.

We also discuss very low energy conformational\nfluctuations akin to those seen previously in amorphous silicon, and reflect on\nthe nature of the amorphous \"ground state\" within a network of fixed topology.\nFor completeness, high energy modes were also computed, and are found to be\nassociated with strained parts of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2012 15:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
