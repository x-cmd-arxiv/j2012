In\nconventional calorimeters the energy resolution is dominated by the stochastic\nvariable $\\fem$, whose broad, skewed pdf has an energy-dependent mean. The slow\nincrease of the mean with $E$ is responsible for response nonlinearity and the\nskewness results in a non-Gaussian response. If the cascade is observed in two\nchannels with different values of $h/e$ (typically scintillator($S$) and\nCherenkov ($C$)), $\\fem$ can be eliminated.

The\nCherenkov $h/e$ will be 0.20--0.25. In sampling calorimeters, $h/e$ can be\nincreased to about 0.7 by arranging for preferential absorption of the\nelectromagnetic (EM) shower energy in the absorber (decreasing $e$) and using a\nhydrogenous detector (organic scintillator) to enhance $h$ through the\ncontribution of recoil protons in $n$--$p$ scattering.

Unlike the usual formulation (in which the\npost-measurement state is a unit vector in Hilbert space), our version actually\nopens the possibility of admitting a purely technical solution within the\nconfines of conventional quantum theory (as opposed to solutions that either\nmodify this theory, or introduce unusual and controversial interpretative rules\nand/or ontologies). To that effect, we recall a remarkable phenomenon in the\ntheory of Schroedinger operators (discovered in 1981 by Jona-Lasinio et al),\naccording to which the ground state of a symmetric double-well Hamiltonian\nbecomes exponentially sensitive to tiny perturbations of the potential as h ->\n0. We show that this instability emerges also from the textbook WKB\napproximation, extend it to time-dependent perturbations, and study the\ndynamical transition from the ground state of the double well to the perturbed\nground state (in which the cat is typically either dead or alive, depending on\nthe details of the perturbation). Numerical simulations show that adiabatically\narising perturbations may (quite literally) cause the collapse of the\nwave-function in the classical limit. Thus, at least in the context of a simple\nmathematical model, we combine the technical and conceptual virtues of\ndecoherence (which fails to solve the measurement problem but launches the key\nidea that perturbations may come from the environment) with those of dynamical\ncollapse models a la GRW (which do solve the measurement problem but are ad\nhoc), without sharing their drawbacks: single measurement outcomes are obtained\n(instead of merely diagonal reduced density matrices), and no modification of\nquantum mechanics is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 17:33:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 13:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

Between z=0 and z=1, this decline of interaction-induced\nstar-formation enhancement occurs in parallel with the dramatic increase (by a\nfactor of ~10) of the sSFR of single SFGs, both can be explained by the higher\ngas fraction in higher z disks. SFGs in mixed pairs (S+E pairs) do not show any\nsignificant star-formation enhancement at any redshift. The difference between\nSFGs in S+S pairs and in S+E pairs suggests a modulation of the sSFR by the\ninter-galactic medium IGM in the dark matter halos (DMH) hosting these pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 17:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

All moments are considered as degrees of freedom, with the\nstrong moments thermally fluctuating only in angle and the weak moments\nthermally fluctuating in angle and magnitude. We argue that a quadratic\ndependence of the energy on the weak local moments magnitude, which is a good\napproximation in many cases, allows for an elimination of the weak-moment\ndegrees of freedom from the thermodynamic expressions in favor of a\nrenormalization of the Heisenberg interactions among the strong moments.

For such applications, overwhelming empirical\nevidence suggests that superior image reconstruction can be obtained through\nvariable density sampling strategies that concentrate on lower frequencies. The\nwavelet and Fourier transform domains are not incoherent because low-order\nwavelets and low-order frequencies are correlated, so compressive sensing\ntheory does not immediately imply sampling strategies and reconstruction\nguarantees. In this paper we turn to a more refined notion of coherence -- the\nso-called local coherence -- measuring for each sensing vector separately how\ncorrelated it is to the sparsity basis. For Fourier measurements and Haar\nwavelet sparsity, the local coherence can be controlled and bounded explicitly,\nso for matrices comprised of frequencies sampled from a suitable inverse square\npower-law density, we can prove the restricted isometry property with\nnear-optimal embedding dimensions. Consequently, the variable-density sampling\nstrategy we provide allows for image reconstructions that are stable to\nsparsity defects and robust to measurement noise.

In this work we use a wide\nrange of non-cosmological N-body simulations to examine halo shapes and\ndirection-dependence of velocity anisotropy profiles. For each of our simulated\nhaloes we define 48 cones pointing in different directions, and from the\nparticles inside each cone we compute velocity anisotropy profiles.

We\nencourage future studies of velocity anisotropies in haloes from cosmological\nsimulations to calculate beta-profiles in cones, since it reveals information,\nwhich is hidden from a spherically averaged profile.

On\nthe other hand the gaugino masses are 1-loop smaller than the gravitino and\nHiggsino masses, arising from both anomaly mediation and a Higgsino loop. Wino\ndark matter arises from three sources: gravitino production by scattering at\nhigh temperatures, gravitino production from squark decays, and thermal\nfreeze-out. For reheating temperatures larger than the squark mass, these\nconspire to require that the squarks are lighter than about 10^4 TeV, while\ncollider limits on gaugino masses require squarks to be heavier than about 100\nTeV.

Sources with\npeaked PACO spectra show a decrease of the peak frequency with time at a mean\nrate of -3 +- 2 GHz/yr on an average timescale of \\tau = 2.1 +- 0.5 yr. The\n5-20 GHz spectral indices show a systematic decrease from AT20G to PACO\nobservations. At higher frequencies spectral indices steepen: the median \\alpha\n30-40 GHz is steeper than the median \\alpha 5-20 GHz by \\delta\\alpha = 0.6.\nTaking further into account the WISE data we find that the SEDs, \\nu S(\\nu), of\nmost of our blazars peak at \\nu_p <10^5 GHz; the median peak wavelength is\n\\lambda_p ~93 \\mu m. Only 6 have \\nu_p>10^5 GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 20:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Field [5] refers to an unpublished work by J. Ize for a result that loss\nof stability through an absolutely irreducible representation of a compact Lie\ngroup leads to bifurcation of steady states. The main ingredient of the proof\nis the hypotheses, that for an absolutely irreducible representation of a\ncompact Lie group there exists a closed subgroup whose fixed point space is odd\ndimensional. Then, using Brouwer degree, one gets the result. We refer to the\nhypotheses that for an absolutely irreducible representation of a compact Lie\ngroup there exists at least one subgroup with an odd dimensional fixed point\nspace as the algebraic Ize conjecture (AIC). Lauterbach and Matthews [10] have\nshown that the (AIC) is in general not true.

Moreover in [10] it is shown that in spite of\nthis failure of the (AIC) the original conjecture is true at least for groups\nin two of these three families. In this paper we show a similar bifurcation\nresult for the third family defined in [10].

The ideas\nfrom mathematics are resurgence theory, the trans-series framework, and\nBorel-Ecalle resummation. The ideas from QFT use continuity on R^1 x S^1_L,\ni.e, the absence of any phase transition as N \\to infinity, or rapid-crossovers\nfor finite-N, and the small-L weak coupling limit to render the semi-classical\nsector well-defined and calculable. We classify semi-classical configurations\nwith actions 1/N (kink-instantons), 2/N (bions and bi-kinks), in units where\nthe 2d instanton action is normalized to one. Perturbation theory possesses the\nIR-renormalon ambiguity that arises due to non-Borel summability of the\nlarge-orders perturbation series (of Gevrey-1 type), for which a microscopic\ncancellation mechanism was unknown. This divergence must be present because the\ncorresponding expansion is on a singular Stokes ray in the complexified\ncoupling constant plane, and the sum exhibits the Stokes phenomenon crossing\nthe ray. We show that there is also a non-perturbative ambiguity inherent to\ncertain neutral topological molecules (neutral bions and bion-anti-bions) in\nthe semiclassical expansion. We find a set of \"confluence equations\" that\nencode the exact cancellation of the two different type of ambiguities. We show\nthat a new notion of \"graded resurgence triangle\" is necessary to capture the\npath integral approach to resurgence, and that graded resurgence underlies a\npotentially rigorous definition of general QFTs. The mass gap and the Theta\nangle dependence of vacuum energy are calculated from first principles, and are\nin accord with large-N and lattice results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Oct 2012 21:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-06"}

Astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them as\nparameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival (TOAs).

However, timing-based\nastrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise, which can\nbe compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitational\nwave background. We investigate how noise of different spectral types is\nabsorbed by timing models, leading to significant estimation errors in the\nastrometric parameters. We find that commonly used techniques for fitting\ntiming models in the presence of red noise (Cholesky whitening) prevent the\nabsorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baseline\nof observations exceeds several years, but are inadequate for dealing with\nshorter pulsar data sets.

We mainly present the numerical results of two\ncomparative models so that the A-SN feedback effects on galaxies can be more\nclearly seen. SNe originating from stars with masses larger than 30M_sun are\nA-SNe in the \"ASN\" model whereas all SNe are spherical ones (S-SNe) in the\n\"SSN\" model. Each S-SN and A-SN are assumed to release feedback energy of\n10^{51} erg and 10^{52} erg, respectively, and chemical yields and feedback\nenergy of A-SN ejecta depend on angles between the axis of symmetry and the\nejection directions. We find that star formation can become at least by a\nfactor of ~3 lower in the ASN model in comparison with the SSN one owing to the\nmore energetic feedback of A-SNe. As a result of this, chemical evolution can\nproceed very slowly in the ASN model. A-SN feedback effects can play a\nsignificant role in the formation of giant gaseous holes and energetic gaseous\noutflow and unique chemical abundances (e.g., high [Mg/Ca]).

CSTSK may be\ncombined with a classic signaling set (eg. QAM, PSK) in order to strike a\nflexible tradeoff between the achievable diversity and multiplexing gain. One\nof the key benefits of the CSTSK scheme is its Inter-Channel Interference (ICI)\nfree system that makes single-stream Maximum Likelihood detection possible at\nlow-complexity. In the existing CSTSK scheme, DMs are chosen by maximizing the\nmutual information over a large set of complex valued, Gaussian random matrices\nthrough numerical simulations. We refer to them as Capacity-Optimized (CO) DMs.\nIn this contribution we establish a connection between the STSK scheme as well\nas the Space-Time Block Codes (STBC) and show that a class of STBCs termed as\nDecomposable Dispersion Codes (DDC) enjoy all the benefits that are specific to\nthe STSK scheme. Two STBCs belonging to this class are proposed, a rate-one\ncode from Field Extensions and a full-rate code from Cyclic Division Algebras,\nthat offer structured DMs with desirable properties such as full-diversity, and\na high coding gain. We show that the DMs derived from these codes are capable\nof achieving a performance than CO-DMs, and emphasize the importance of DMs\nhaving a higher coding gain than CO-DMs in scenarios having realistic,\nimperfect channel state information at the receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 06:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-10"}

Then the relative or absolute protein abundance is estimated\nwith quantification methods, such as spectral counting. Until now, researchers\nhave been dealing with these two processes separately. In fact, they are two\nsides of same coin in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteins\nwith non-zero abundances. Then, one interesting question is if we regard the\nprotein inference problem as a special protein quantification problem, is it\npossible to achieve better protein inference performance?\n  Contribution: In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using protein\nquantification methods to solve the protein inference problem. Protein\ninference is to determine whether each candidate protein is present in the\nsample or not. Protein quantification is to calculate the abundance of each\nprotein. Naturally, the absent proteins should have zero abundances. Thus, we\nargue that the protein inference problem can be viewed as a special case of\nprotein quantification problem: present proteins are those proteins with\nnon-zero abundances. Based on this idea, our paper tries to use three very\nsimple protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem\neffectively.\n  Results: The experimental results on six datasets show that these three\nmethods are competitive with previous protein inference algorithms. This\ndemonstrates that it is plausible to take the protein inference problem as a\nspecial case of protein quantification, which opens the door of devising more\neffective protein inference algorithms from a quantification perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 07:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-10"}

Theoretically, there exist\nnumerous inflationary scenarios which predict large and characteristic\nnon-Gaussianities in the primordial perturbations. These model-dependent\nnon-Gaussianities act as sources of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nbispectrum; therefore, the analysis of the CMB bispectrum is very important and\nattractive in order to clarify the nature of the early Universe. Currently, the\nimpacts of the primordial non-Gaussianities in the scalar perturbations, where\nthe rotational and parity invariances are kept, on the CMB bispectrum have been\nwell-studied. However, for a complex treatment, the CMB bispectra generated\nfrom the non-Gaussianities, which originate from the vector- and tensor-mode\nperturbations and include the violation of the rotational or parity invariance,\nhave never been considered in spite of the importance of this information. On\nthe basis of our current studies, this thesis provides the general formalism\nfor the CMB bispectrum sourced by the non-Gaussianities not only in the\nscalar-mode perturbations but also in the vector- and tensor-mode\nperturbations. Applying this formalism, we calculate the CMB bispectrum from\ntwo scalars and a graviton correlation and that from primordial magnetic\nfields, and we then outline new constraints on these amplitudes. Furthermore,\nthis formalism can be easily extended to the cases where the rotational or\nparity invariance is broken. We also compute the CMB bispectra from the\nnon-Gaussianities of the curvature perturbations with a preferred direction and\nthe graviton non-Gaussianities induced by the parity-violating Weyl cubic\nterms. We also present some unique impacts to the violation of these\ninvariances on the CMB bispectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 07:59:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2013 16:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-21"}

Spectroscopic data were coupled with UV\nphotometry obtained during the spectroscopic run. We found a considerable\nstar-to-star variation in both A(C) and A(N) at all luminosities for our sample\nof 35 targets. These abundances appear to be anticorrelated, with a hint of\nbimodality in the C content for stars with luminosities below the RBG bump\n(V~15.7), while the range of variations in N abundances is very large and spans\nalmost ~ 2 dex. We find additional C depletion as the stars evolve off the RGB\nbump, in fairly good agreement with theoretical predictions for metal-poor\nstars in the course of normal stellar evolution. We isolated two groups with\nN-rich and N-poor stars and found that N abundance variations correlate with\nthe (U-V) color in the DOLORES color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The V, (U-V) CMD\nfor this cluster shows an additional RGB sequence, located at the red of the\nmain RGB and amounting to a small fraction of the total giant population.

In this paper we revisit the problem to\nestimate the order of magnitude of the dephasing caused by the second order\nself-forces on a small body in a quasi-circular orbit around a Kerr black hole,\nbased on the knowledge of the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation and invoking\nthe energy balance argument.

To avoid the possibility\nthat the energy flux of GWs becomes negative, we propose a new simple\nresummation called exponential resummation, which assures the positivity of the\nenergy flux. In order to estimate the magnitude of the yet unknown second order\nself-forces, here we point out the scaling property in the absolute value of\nthe PN coefficients of the energy flux. Using these new tools, we evaluate the\nexpected magnitude of dephasing. Our analysis indicates that the dephasing due\nto the second order self-forces for quasi-circular E(I)MRIs may be well\ncaptured by the 3PN energy flux, once we obtain all the spin dependent terms,\nexcept for the case with an extremely large spin of the central Kerr black.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 11:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 20:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-09"}

Adaptive MCMC algorithms such as adaptive Metropolis (AM),\nwhich self-calibrates its proposal distribution using an online estimate of the\ncovariance matrix of the target, are no exception. To address the\nlabel-switching issue, relabeling algorithms associate a permutation to each\nMCMC sample, trying to obtain reasonable marginals. In the case of adaptive\nMetropolis (Bernoulli 7 (2001) 223-242), an online relabeling strategy is\nrequired. This paper is devoted to the AMOR algorithm, a provably consistent\nvariant of AM that can cope with the label-switching problem. The idea is to\nnest relabeling steps within the MCMC algorithm based on the estimation of a\nsingle covariance matrix that is used both for adapting the covariance of the\nproposal distribution in the Metropolis algorithm step and for online\nrelabeling. We compare the behavior of AMOR to similar relabeling methods. In\nthe case of compactly supported target distributions, we prove a strong law of\nlarge numbers for AMOR and its ergodicity. These are the first results on the\nconsistency of an online relabeling algorithm to our knowledge. The proof\nunderlines latent relations between relabeling and vector quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 14:05:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2013 15:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 11:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

This work investigates the variations of 74 microwave ZP\nstructures observed by Chinese Solar Broadband Radio Spectrometer\n(SBRS/Huairou) at 2.6-3.8 GHz in 9 solar flares, and found that the ratio\nbetween the plasma density scale height LN and the magnetic field scale height\nLB in emission source displays a tendency of decrease during the flaring\nprocesses. The ratio LN/LB is about 3-5 before the maximum of flares. It\ndecreases to about 2 after the maximum. The detailed analysis of three typical\nX-class flares implied that the variation of LN/LB during the flaring process\nis most likely due to the topological changes of the magnetic field in the\nflaring source region, and the step-wise decrease of LN/LB possibly reflects\nthe magnetic field relaxation relative to the plasma density when the flaring\nenergy released. This result may also constrain the solar flare modeling to\nsome extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 14:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This paper tries to answer questions like: How many terms of a\ngiven size are there? What is a \"typical\" structure of a simply typable term?\nDespite their ostensible simplicity, these questions still remain unanswered,\nwhereas solutions to such problems are essential for testing compilers and\noptimizing programs whose expected efficiency depends on the size of terms.

This paper\npresents two complementary approaches: one, theoretical, uses complex analysis\nand generating functions, the other, experimental, is based on a generator of\nlambda-terms. Thanks to de Bruijn indices, we provide three families of\nformulas for the number of closed lambda terms of a given size and we give four\nrelations between these numbers which have interesting combinatorial\ninterpretations.

Quantum dots in group IV materials have\nthe advantage of avoiding decoherence from the hyperfine interaction by\npurifying them with only zero-spin nuclei. Complications of group IV materials\narise from the valley degeneracies in the electronic bandstructure. These lead\nto complicated multiplet states even for two-electron quantum dots thereby\nsignificantly weakening the selection rules for Pauli blockade. Only recently\nhave spin qubits been realized in silicon devices where the valley degeneracy\nis lifted by strain and spatial confinement. In carbon nanotubes Pauli blockade\ncan be observed by lifting valley degeneracy through disorder. In clean\nnanotubes, quantum dots have to be made ultra-small to obtain a large energy\ndifference between the relevant multiplet states. Here we report on\nlow-disorder nanotubes and demonstrate Pauli blockade based on both valley and\nspin selection rules. We exploit the bandgap of the nanotube to obtain a large\nlevel spacing and thereby a robust blockade.

The introduced methodology\nsimultaneously deals with two problems: a) the arbitrariness in data-points\norientation and b) the determination of one proper form for a prototype curve\nthat optimally fits the corresponding contour data. Arbitrariness in\norientation has been dealt with a novel curvature based error, while the proper\nforms of curve prototypes have been exhaustively determined by embedding\ncurvature deformations of the prototypes into 4-manifolds. Application of this\nmethodology to celebrated wall-paintings excavated at Tyrins, Greece and the\nGreek island of Thera, manifests it is highly probable that these\nwall-paintings had been drawn by means of geometric guides that correspond to\nlinear spirals and hyperbolae.

However, many applications provide only a partial mapping\nbetween the views, creating a challenge for current methods. To address this\nproblem, we propose a multi-view algorithm based on constrained clustering that\ncan operate with an incomplete mapping. Given a set of pairwise constraints in\neach view, our approach propagates these constraints using a local similarity\nmeasure to those instances that can be mapped to the other views, allowing the\npropagated constraints to be transferred across views via the partial mapping.\nIt uses co-EM to iteratively estimate the propagation within each view based on\nthe current clustering model, transfer the constraints across views, and then\nupdate the clustering model. By alternating the learning process between views,\nthis approach produces a unified clustering model that is consistent with all\nviews. We show that this approach significantly improves clustering performance\nover several other methods for transferring constraints and allows multi-view\nclustering to be reliably applied when given a limited mapping between the\nviews. Our evaluation reveals that the propagated constraints have high\nprecision with respect to the true clusters in the data, explaining their\nbenefit to clustering performance in both single- and multi-view learning\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 15:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

Determination of such\ncharacteristics allows for developing methods offering an image of the\nundeformed body. General assumptions about the mechano-elastic properties of\nthe bodies are stated, which lead to two different approaches for obtaining\nbodies' deformation invariants. One was developed to spot deformed body's\nneutral line and its cross sections, while the other solves deformation PDEs by\nperforming a set of equivalent image operations on the deformed body images.\nBoth these processes may furnish a body undeformed version from its deformed\nimage. This was confirmed by obtaining the undeformed shape of deformed\nparasites, cells (protozoa), fibers and human lips. In addition, the method has\nbeen applied to the important problem of parasite automatic classification from\ntheir microscopic images. To achieve this, we first apply the previous method\nto straighten the highly deformed parasites and then we apply a dedicated curve\nclassification method to the straightened parasite contours. It is demonstrated\nthat essentially different deformations of the same parasite give rise to\npractically the same undeformed shape, thus confirming the consistency of the\nintroduced methodology. Finally, the developed pattern recognition method\nclassifies the unwrapped parasites into 6 families, with an accuracy rate of\n97.6 %.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 15:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-10"}
