The Fe K beta emission line is also\nclearly detected and its intensity is marginally higher than the theoretical\nvalue for low ionisation Fe. A comparison with previous observations performed\nwith XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX reveals that the X-ray spectral curvature changes\non a timescale of a few months. We analysed all these historical observations,\nwith standard models as well as with a most recent model for a toroidal\nreprocessor and found that the main driver of the observed 2-10 keV spectral\nvariability is a change of the line-of-sight obscuration, varying from\n\\sim4x10^23 cm^-2 to \\sim9 x 10^23 cm^-2. The primary continuum is also\nvariable, although its photon index does not appear to vary, while the Fe K\nalpha line and reflection component are consistent with being constant across\nthe observations. This suggests the presence of a rather constant reprocessor\nand that the observed line of sight NH variability is either due to a certain\ndegree of clumpiness of the putative torus or due to the presence of a second\nclumpy absorber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 16:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

There are, of course, many possible criteria. Model simplicity is\none of the most common criteria in theory evaluation. The Minimum Message\nLength (MML) is a solid approach to evaluate theories relative to a given\nevidence or data. Theories can be expressed in specific or general\n(Turing-complete) languages. First-order logic, and logic programming in\nparticular, is a Turing-complete language. Evaluating the simplicity of a\ntheory or program described in a Turing-complete language is much more\ndifficult than just counting the number of lines or bits. It is, in fact, the\nproblem of calculating its Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable. Few\nworks in the literature have been able to present accurate and effective\napproximations for a Turing-complete language. In this work, we present the\nfirst general MML coding scheme for logic programs. With this scheme, we can\nquantify the bits of information required to code (or send) a theory, a set of\ndata or the same data given the theory.

We calculate the typical Jeans mass using\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative model\nfor the ISM, which yields a parameterisation of the IMF characteristic mass as\na function of galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We then calculate the star\nformation histories of galaxies utilising an equilibrium galaxy growth model\ncoupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundance\nmatching models. We find that at early times, energetic coupling between dust\nand gas drive warm conditions in the ISM, yielding bottom-light/top- heavy IMFs\nassociated with large ISM Jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies.

In the first, Tycho B\nis a blue straggler, formed from the merger of a close K- or G-type binary\nsystem, which was previously in a quadruple system with the binary that\nproduced SN 1572. Both binaries were likely brought to tidal contact by\nKozai-Lidov oscillations acting in concert with tidal friction. Analogous\nprogenitor systems may include CzeV343, VW LMi, and KIC 4247791. In the second,\nTycho B is the surviving tertiary component of a triple system, which was also\nlikely affected by Kozai-Lidov oscillations.

In\nthis work we introduce the model of a projection graph that is the result of\ndecentralizing a social graph onto a peer-to-peer network. We focus on three\nsocial network metrics: degree, node betweenness and edge betweenness\ncentrality and analytically formulate the relation between metrics in the\nsocial graph and in the projection graph. Through experimental evaluation on\nreal networks, we demonstrate that when mapping user communities of sizes up to\n50-150 users on each peer, the association between the properties of the social\ngraph and the projection graph is high, and thus the properties of the\n(dynamic) projection graph can be inferred from the properties of the (slower\nchanging) social graph. Furthermore, we demonstrate with two application\nscenarios on large-scale social networks the usability of the projection graph\nin designing social search applications and unstructured P2P overlays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 20:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-24"}

Recent hydrodynamic simulations of\naccretion of solar material onto white dwarfs without mixing always produce a\nthermonuclear runaway and steady burning does not occur. For a broad range in\nWD mass (0.4 Solar masses to 1.35 Solar Masses), the maximum ejected material\noccurs for the 1.25 Solar Mass sequences and then decreases as the white dwarf\nmass decreases. Therefore, the white dwarfs are growing in mass as a\nconsequence of the accretion of solar material and as long as there is no\nmixing of accreted material with core material. In contrast, a thermonuclear\nrunaway in the accreted hydrogen-rich layers on the low luminosity WDs in close\nbinary systems where mixing of core matter with accreted material has occurred\nis the outburst mechanism for Classical, Recurrent, and Symbiotic novae. The\ndifferences in characteristics of these systems is likely the WD mass and mass\naccretion rate. The high levels of enrichment of CN ejecta in elements ranging\nfrom carbon to sulfur confirm that there is dredge-up of matter from the core\nof the WD and enable them to contribute to the chemical enrichment of the\ninterstellar medium. Therefore, studies of CNe can lead to an improved\nunderstanding of Galactic nucleosynthesis, some sources of pre-solar grains,\nand the Extragalactic distance scale.

Comparing our result to astrophysical data, we show that for a range\nof sufficiently large saturation amplitudes r-modes provide a viable spindown\nscenario and that all observed young pulsars are very likely already outside\nthe r-mode instability region. Therefore the most promising sources for\ngravitational wave detection are unobserved neutron stars associated with\nrecent supernovae, and we find that advanced LIGO should be able to see several\nof them. We find the remarkable result that the gravitational wave strain\namplitude is completely independent of both the r-mode saturation amplitude and\nthe microphysics, and depends on the saturation mechanism only within some tens\nof per cent. However, the gravitational wave frequency depends on the amplitude\nand we provide the required expected timing parameter ranges to look for\npromising sources in future searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 00:21:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2013 20:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-25"}

Two models have been proposed\nto explain this result. In the adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS), it is\nthought to be due to the loss of gas in outflows. In the convection-dominated\naccretion flow (CDAF) model, it is explained as because that the gas is locked\nin convective eddies. In this paper we use hydrodynamical (HD) and\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to investigate which one is physical.\nWe calculate and compare various properties of inflow (gas with an inward\nvelocity) and outflow (gas with an outward velocity). Systematic and\nsignificant differences are found. For example, for HD flows, the temperature\nof outflow is higher than inflow; while for MHD flows, the specific angular\nmomentum of outflow is much higher than inflow. We have also analyzed the\nconvective stability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are stable.\nThese results suggest that systematic inward and outward motion must exist,\ni.e., the ADIOS model is favored. The different properties of inflow and\noutflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing outflow in HD and MHD\nflows are buoyancy associated with the convection and the centrifugal force\nassociated with the angular momentum transport mediated by the magnetic field,\nrespectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the Blandford & Payne\nmechanism but no large-scale open magnetic field is required here. Possible\nobservational applications are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 00:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Accurately evaluating the gains of coordination, however, is\ncontingent upon using a network topology that models realistic cellular\ndeployments. In this paper, we model the base stations locations as a Poisson\npoint process to provide a better analytical assessment of the performance of\ncoordination. Since interference coordination is only feasible within clusters\nof limited size, we consider a random clustering process where cluster stations\nare located according to a random point process and groups of base stations\nassociated with the same cluster coordinate. We assume channel knowledge is\nexchanged among coordinating base stations, and we analyze the performance of\ninterference coordination when channel knowledge at the transmitters is either\nperfect or acquired through limited feedback. We apply intercell interference\nnulling (ICIN) to coordinate interference inside the clusters. The feasibility\nof ICIN depends on the number of antennas at the base stations. Using tools\nfrom stochastic geometry, we derive the probability of coverage and the average\nrate for a typical mobile user. We show that the average cluster size can be\noptimized as a function of the number of antennas to maximize the gains of\nICIN. To minimize the mean loss in rate due to limited feedback, we propose an\nadaptive feedback allocation strategy at the mobile users. We show that\nadapting the bit allocation as a function of the signals' strength increases\nthe achievable rate with limited feedback, compared to equal bit partitioning.\nFinally, we illustrate how this analysis can help solve network design problems\nsuch as identifying regions where coordination provides gains based on average\ncluster size, number of antennas, and number of feedback bits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 00:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A number of reversing-based VCSs (or VCSs with reversing) (RVCS)\nhave been proposed for binary secret images, allowing participants to perform a\nreversing operation on shares (or shadows). This reversing operation can be\neasily implemented by current copy machines. Some existing traditional VCS\nschemes without reversing (nRVCS) can be extended to RVCS with the same pixel\nexpansion for binary image, and the RVCS can achieve ideal contrast,\nsignificantly higher than that of the corresponding nRVCS.

Young, massive stars have been found at projected distances R < 0.5 pc\nfrom supermassive black hole, Sgr A* at the center of our Galay. In recent\nyears, increasing evidence has been found for the presence of young, massive\nstars also at R > 0.5 pc. Our goal in this work is a systematic search for\nyoung, massive star candidates throughout the entire region within R ~ 2.5 pc\nof the black hole. Methods. The main criterion for the photometric\nidentification of young, massive early-type stars is the lack of CO-absorption\nin the spectra. We used narrow-band imaging with VLT/ISAAC to search for young,\nmassive stars within ~2.5 pc of Sgr A*. Results. We have found 63 early-type\nstar candidates at R < 2.5 pc, with an estimated erroneous identification rate\nof only about 20%. Considering their K-band magnitudes and interstellar\nextinction, they are candidates for Wolf-Rayet stars, supergiants, or early\nO-type stars. Of these, 31 stars are so far unknown young, massive star\ncandidates, all of which lie at R>0.5pc. The surface number density profile of\nthe young, massive star candidates can be well fit by a single power-law, with\nGamma = 1.6 +- 0.17 at R < 2.5 pc, which is significantly steeper than that of\nthe late-type giants that make up the bulk of the observable stars in the NSC.\nIntriguingly, this power-law is consistent with the power-law that describes\nthe surface density of young, massive stars in the same brightness range at R <\n0.5 pc. Conclusions. The finding of a significant number of newly identified\nearly-type star candidates at the Galactic center suggests that young, massive\nstars can be found throughout the entire cluster which may require us to modify\nexisting theories for star formation at the Galactic center.

The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) is an\nimplementation of the PTA concept based on observations with the Parkes 64-m\nradio telescope. A sample of 20 millisecond pulsars is being observed at three\nradio-frequency bands, 50cm (~700 MHz), 20cm (~1400 MHz) and 10cm (~3100 MHz),\nwith observations at intervals of 2 - 3 weeks.

The strategy\nbehind the choice of pulsars, observing parameters and analysis methods is\ndiscussed. Results are presented for PPTA data in the three bands taken between\n2005 March and 2011 March.

The global\ntrade network is a typical overlay network, which compounds multiple standalone\ntrade networks representing the transmission of a single product and connecting\nthe same set of countries and territories through their own set of trade\ninteractions. Although the epidemic dynamic implications of overlay networks\nhave been debated in recent studies, some general answers for the overlay of\nmultiple and diverse standalone networks remain elusive, especially the\nrelationship between the heterogeneity and diversity of a set of standalone\nnetworks and the behavior of the overlay network. In this paper, we establish a\ngeneral analysis framework for multiple overlay networks based on diversity\ntheory. The framework could reveal the critical epidemic mechanisms beyond\noverlay processes. Applying the framework to global trade networks, we found\nthat, although the distribution of connectivity of standalone trade networks\nwas highly heterogeneous, epidemic behavior on overlay networks is more\ndependent on cooperation among standalone trade networks rather than on a few\nhigh-connectivity networks as the general property of complex systems with\nheterogeneous distribution. Moreover, the analysis of overlay trade networks\nrelated to 7 real pathogens also suggested that epidemic behavior is not\ncontrolled by high-connectivity goods but that the actual compound mode of\noverlay trade networks plays a critical role in spreading pathogens. Finally,\nwe study the influence of cooperation mechanisms on the stability of overlay\nnetworks and on the control of global epidemics. The framework provides a\ngeneral tool to study different problems on overlay networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 06:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-24"}

This distinction is based on the different behavior of the\nFNVI for the two cases: the indicator after a very short transient period of\nfluctuation displays a nearly constant value for regular orbits, while it\ncontinues to fluctuate significantly for chaotic orbits. In order to quantify\nthe results obtained by the FNVI method, we establish the dFNVI, which is the\nquantified numerical version of the FNVI. A thorough study of the method's\nability to achieve an early and clear detection of an orbit's behavior is\npresented both in two and three degrees of freedom (2D and 3D) Hamiltonians.\nExploiting the advantages of the dFNVI method, we demonstrate how one can\nrapidly identify even tiny regions of order or chaos in the phase space of\nHamiltonian systems.

As a first test of the code's\nviability, stellar evolution models are computed for the components of a\nsolar-type, detached eclipsing binary (DEB) system, EF Aquarii, shown to\nexhibit large disagreements with stellar models. The addition of the magnetic\nperturbation corrects the radius and effective temperature discrepancies\nobserved in EF Aquarii. Furthermore, the required magnetic field strength at\nthe model photosphere is within a factor of two of the magnetic field strengths\nestimated from the stellar X-ray luminosities measured by ROSAT and those\npredicted from Ca II K line core emission. These models provide firm evidence\nthat the suppression of thermal convection arising from the presence of a\nmagnetic field is sufficient to significantly alter the structure of solar-type\nstars, producing noticeably inflated radii and cooler effective temperatures.\nThe inclusion of magnetic effects within a stellar evolution model has a wide\nrange of applications, from DEBs and exoplanet host stars to the donor stars of\ncataclysmic variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 09:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 10:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-28"}

The main advantage of these\nextensions is that it not only provides the new locations where to perform\nsimulations but also which versions of code have to be simulated (between the\ncomplex one or one of its fast approximations).

Moreover, the\nradio properties of a source, such as the spectrum or morphology, could provide\nfurther insight into its nature. Flat-spectrum radio sources at high Galactic\nlatitudes are likely to be AGN, possibly associated to a blazar or to the\ncompact core of a radio galaxy.

We consider games\nwith arbitrary monitoring structures. One of the purposes of this paper is to\nknow to what extent an encoder, who perfectly observes the played actions and\nsends a complementary public signal to the players, can establish perfect\nmonitoring for all the players. To reach this goal, the main technical problem\nto be solved at the encoder is to design a source encoder which compresses the\naction profile in the most concise manner possible. A special feature of this\nencoder is that the multi-dimensional signal (namely, the action profiles) to\nbe encoded is assumed to comprise a component whose probability distribution is\nnot known to the encoder and the decoder has a side information (the private\nsignals received by the players when the encoder is off). This new framework\nappears to be both of game-theoretical and information-theoretical interest. In\nparticular, it is useful for designing certain types of encoders that are\nresilient to single deviations and provide an equilibrium utility region in the\nproposed setting; it provides a new type of constraints to compress an\ninformation source (i.e., a random variable). Regarding the first aspect, we\napply the derived result to the repeated prisoner's dilemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 14:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-24"}

We have studied the response of the photoionised gas to the changes in\nthe ionising flux produced by the central regions. We were able to put tight\nconstraints on the variability of the absorbers from day to year time scales.\nThis allowed us to develop a model for the time-dependent photoionisation in\nthis source.\n  We find that the more highly ionised gas producing most X-ray line opacity is\nat least 5 pc away from the core; upper limits to the distance of various\nabsorbing components range between 20 pc up to a few kpc.

It turns out that the formalism is not complete and should be\naugmented by an additional equation to imply the full equations of motion. We\nidentify this additional equation as a constraint by using an effective action\nmethod. By computing the renormalized boundary stress tensor, we obtain the\nmass and angular momentum of the black hole solutions of these first order\nequations and confirm that they saturate the BPS bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 15:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 06:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-03"}

At\nfrequencies below the well known emission peak at the Josephson frequency\n(2eV/h), extra radiation is triggered by quantum fluctuations in the\nelectromagnetic environment. For weak tunneling couplings and typical ohmic\ntransmission lines, the corresponding photon flux spectrum is symmetric around\nhalf the Josephson frequency, indicating that the photons are predominately\ncreated in pairs. By establishing an input-output formalism for the microwave\nfield in the transmission line, we give further evidence for this nonclassical\nphoton pair production, demonstrating that it violates the classical\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality for two-mode flux cross correlations. In connection\nto recent experiments, we also consider a stepped transmission line, where\nresonances increase the signal-to-noise ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 15:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2013 10:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}
