The human\ncapital dynamics of each agent is described by a stochastic multiplicative\nprocess which, in the long run, leads to the destruction of individual human\ncapital and the extinction of the individualistic society. When agents are\nlinked by fully-redistributive taxation the situation might turn to individual\ngrowth in the long run. We consider that a government collects a proportion of\nincome and reduces it by a fraction as costs for administration (efficiency\nlosses). The remaining public good is equally redistributed to all agents. We\nderive conditions under which the destruction of human capital can be turned\ninto sustainable growth, despite the losses from the random growth process and\ndespite the administrative costs. Sustainable growth is induced by\nredistribution. This effect could be explained by a simple portfolio-effect\nwhich re-balances individual stochastic processes.\n  The findings are verified for three different tax schemes: proportional tax,\ntaking proportional more from the rich, and proportionally more from the poor.\nWe discuss which of these tax schemes is optimal with respect to maximize\ngrowth under a fixed rate of administrative costs, or with respect to maximize\nthe governmental income. This leads us to some general conclusions about\ngovernmental decisions, the relation to public good games, and the use of\ntaxation in a risk taking society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 16:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Prior to our work, it was not known whether knowledge\nassumptions could be used for achieving security in the concurrent setting, due\nto a number of significant limitations that we discuss here. Nevertheless, we\nobtain the following results:\n  1. We obtain the first constant round concurrent zero-knowledge argument for\n\\textbf{NP} in the plain model based on a new variant of knowledge of exponent\nassumption. Furthermore, our construction avoids the inefficiency inherent in\nprevious non-black-box techniques such that those of Barak (FOCS 2001); we\nobtain our result through an efficient protocol compiler.\n  2.

We analyze an algorithm that we call\n\\textsc{Max-LPA}, both in terms of its convergence time and in terms of the\n\"quality\" of the communities detected. \\textsc{Max-LPA} is an instance of a\nclass of community detection algorithms called \\textit{label propagation}\nalgorithms. As far as we know, most analysis of label propagation algorithms\nthus far has been empirical in nature and in this paper we seek a theoretical\nunderstanding of label propagation algorithms. In our main result, we define a\nclustered version of \\er random graphs with clusters $V_1, V_2,..., V_k$ where\nthe probability $p$, of an edge connecting nodes within a cluster $V_i$ is\nhigher than $p'$, the probability of an edge connecting nodes in distinct\nclusters. We show that even with fairly general restrictions on $p$ and $p'$\n($p = \\Omega(\\frac{1}{n^{1/4-\\epsilon}})$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$, $p' =\nO(p^2)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes), \\textsc{Max-LPA} detects the\nclusters $V_1, V_2,..., V_n$ in just two rounds. Based on this and on empirical\nresults, we conjecture that \\textsc{Max-LPA} can correctly and quickly identify\ncommunities on clustered \\er graphs even when the clusters are much sparser,\ni.e., with $p = \\frac{c\\log n}{n}$ for some $c > 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 19:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

Each has certain drawbacks. The PIC algorithm\ndoes not conserve total energy, which may lead to spurious numerical heating\n(grid heating). Its overall accuracy is at most second due to the nature of the\nforce interpolation between grid and particle position. Energy-conserving\nalgorithms do not exhibit grid heating, but because their formulation uses\npotentials, computationally undesirable matrix inversions may be necessary. In\naddition, compared to PIC algorithms for the same accuracy, these algorithms\nhave higher numerical noise due to the restricted choice of particle shapes.\nHere we formulate time-explicit, finite-size particle algorithms using\nparticular reductions of the particle distribution function. These reductions\nare used in two variational principles, a Lagrangian-based and a\nHamiltonian-based in conjunction with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The\nLagrangian formulations here generalize previous such formulations. The\nHamiltonian formulation is presented here for the first time. Many drawbacks of\nthe two classes of particle methods are mitigated. For example, restrictions on\nparticle shapes are relaxed in energy conserving algorithms, which allows to\ndecrease the numerical noise in these methods. The Hamiltonian formulation of\nparticle algorithms is done in terms of fields instead of potentials, thus\navoiding solving Poisson's equation. An algorithm that conserves both energy\nand momentum is presented. Other features of the algorithms include a natural\nway to perform coordinate transformations, the use of various time integrating\nmethods, and the ability to increase the overall accuracy beyond second order,\nincluding all generalizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Oct 2012 22:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 16:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Upon closer inspection, it is obvious\nthat the acceleration caused by hitting the top of the bottle is followed by\nthe formation of bubbles near the bottom. The nearly instantaneous acceleration\ncreates an area of low pressure on the bottom of the bottle where cavitation\nbubbles form. Moments later, the cavitation bubbles collapse at roughly 10\ntimes the speed of formation, causing the bottle to break. The accelerometer\ndata shows that the bottle is broken after the bubbles collapse and that the\nmagnitude of the bubble collapse is greater than the initial impact. This fluid\ndynamics video highlights that this trick will not work if the bottle is empty\nnor if it is filled with a carbonated fluid because the vapor bubbles fill with\nthe CO2 dissolved in the liquid, preventing the bubbles from collapsing. A\nmodified cavitation number, including the acceleration of the fluid (a), vapor\npressure (Pv), and depth of the fluid column (h), is derived to determine when\ncavity inception occurs. Through experimentation, visible cavitation bubbles\nform when the cavitation number is less than 0.5. The experiments, based on the\nmodified cavitation number, reveal that the easiest way to break a glass bottle\nwith your bare hands is to fill it with a non-carbonated, high vapor pressure\nfluid, and strike it hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2012 06:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 19:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

The present text offers commentaries on the articles from the most\nprominent proponents of the theory. In the early 1960s, the gauge idea was\nsuccessfully applied to the Poincar\\'e group of spacetime symmetries and to the\nrelated conserved energy-momentum and angular momentum currents. The resulting\ntheory, the Poincar\\'e gauge theory, encompasses Einstein's general relativity\nas well as the teleparallel theory of gravity as subcases. The spacetime\nstructure is enriched by Cartan's torsion, and the new theory can accommodate\nfermionic matter and its spin in a perfectly natural way. This guided tour\nstarts from special relativity and leads, in its first part, to general\nrelativity and its gauge type extensions \\`a la Weyl and Cartan. Subsequent\nstopping points are the theories of Yang-Mills and Utiyama and, as a particular\nvantage point, the theory of Sciama and Kibble. Later, the Poincar\\'e gauge\ntheory and its generalizations are explored and special topics, such as its\nHamiltonian formulation and exact solutions, are studied.

We investigate the dynamics\nthat allow for a rigid body to pass through a hemispherical soap film without\nrupturing it. In this fluid dynamics video spheres were dropped from rest above\na hemispherical soap film. At impact, the soap film stretches into a cavity\naround the sphere. As the sphere continues to descend, the film cavity pinches\noff and the film returns to its initial hemispherical shape. Upon closer\nobservation of the film-sphere-air interface, the stability of the soap film\nappears to arise through a balance between the forces of the sphere inertia and\nthe film tension. Therefore the relevant experimental parameter is the Weber\nnumber: We=rho*2*g*h*R*sigma, where R is the sphere radius and h is the height\nthat the sphere is dropped from. We vary the sphere radius and velocity to\nprovide a range of Weber numbers in order to investigate the dependence of film\nstability. Three subtly distinct regimes arise across the observed experimental\nrange of Weber numbers. The first regime is demonstrated (We<3200) by a cavity\nshape that resembles a catenoid which pinches off both near the sphere and the\nhemispherical surface. The second regime is demonstrated (3200<We<6100) by a\nuniformly narrowing cavity resembling an inverted cone that pinches off near\nthe sphere. The third regime initially appears similar to the second but the\ngreater sphere inertia (6100<We) elongates the cavity shape and causes\npinch-off and cavity collapse to be non-uniform in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2012 14:32:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2013 19:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-15"}

Rev. D82 (2010) 044006. One of the\nelements of the solution is the chameleonic behaviour of the Einstein frame\ndilaton: the mass of the dilaton is an increasing function of the matter\ndensity. In that model, a proper structure of the string-frame form factors in\nthe strong coupling region of string theory is assumed. In particular, a\nstabilizing potential of the string frame dilaton is present and it is supposed\nto be the result of a quantum calculation. Our main purpose in this article is\nto point out that the lagrangian of the chameleonic model for the dilaton can\nbe embedded, to a large extent, in heterotic-M-theory. We illustrate some\ntheoretical grounds that support the ansatz about the form factors. In this\npaper, we break bulk supersymmetry with a massive sterile spinor field (i.e. a\nbulk neutrino field) and, under certain assumptions about the full M-theory\naction, we point out the Casimir origin of the stabilizing potential for the\nstring frame dilaton (particular attention is dedicated to the role of the\nconformal transformations involved). Moreover, we point out the similarity\nbetween the string frame dark matter lagrangian and a Ginzburg-Landau\nlagrangian with sterile neutrino pairs playing the role of dark matter\nparticles. However, more research efforts are necessary to connect the bulk\nspinor (neutrino) lagrangian with the Ginzburg-Landau lagrangian through direct\ncalculations. A phenomenological test of these ideas is definitely required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2012 07:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-18"}
