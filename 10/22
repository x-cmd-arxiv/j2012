In this paper we explore situations beyond\nself-organization, in particular how to externally control such dynamical\nsystems in order to eventually enforce pattern formation also in those\nsituations where this wished phenomenon does not result from spontaneous\nconvergence. Our focus is on dynamical systems of Cucker-Smale type, modeling\nconsensus emergence, and we question the existence of stabilization and optimal\ncontrol strategies which require the minimal amount of external intervention\nfor nevertheless inducing consensus in a group of interacting agents. We\nprovide a variational criterion to explicitly design feedback controls that are\ncomponentwise sparse, i.e. with at most one nonzero component at every instant\nof time. Controls sharing this sparsity feature are very realistic and\nconvenient for practical issues. Moreover, the maximally sparse ones are\ninstantaneously optimal in terms of the decay rate of a suitably designed\nLyapunov functional, measuring the distance from consensus. As a consequence we\nprovide a mathematical justification to the general principle according to\nwhich \"sparse is better\" in the sense that a policy maker, who is not allowed\nto predict future developments, should always consider more favorable to\nintervene with stronger action on the fewest possible instantaneous optimal\nleaders rather than trying to control more agents with minor strength in order\nto achieve group consensus. We then establish local and global sparse\ncontrollability properties to consensus and, finally, we analyze the sparsity\nof solutions of the finite time optimal control problem where the minimization\ncriterion is a combination of the distance from consensus and of the l1-norm of\nthe control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2012 17:22:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 18:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 15:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-24"}

The fundamental problem in the\nconsidered network is the design of transmission strategies at the secondary\nnode. It involves three basic elements: first, how to split the power for\nrelaying the primary signals and for transmitting the secondary signals;\nsecond, what two-way relay strategy should be used to assist the bidirectional\ncommunication between the two PUs; third, how to jointly design the primary and\nsecondary transmit precoders. This work aims to address this problem by\nproposing a transmission framework of maximizing the achievable rate of the SU\nwhile maintaining the rate requirements of the two PUs. Three well-known and\npractical two-way relay strategies are considered: amplify-and-forward (AF),\nbit level XOR based decode-and-forward (DF-XOR) and symbol level superposition\ncoding based DF (DF-SUP). For each relay strategy, although the design problem\nis non-convex, we find the optimal solution by using certain transformation\ntechniques and optimization tools such as semidefinite programming (SDP) and\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP). Closed-form solutions are also obtained\nunder certain conditions. Simulation results show that when the rate\nrequirements of the two PUs are symmetric, by using the DF-XOR strategy and\napplying the proposed optimal precoding, the SU requires the least power for\nrelaying and thus reserves the most power to transmit its own signal. In the\nasymmetric scenario, on the other hand, the DF-SUP strategy with the\ncorresponding optimal precoding is the best.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2012 19:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We investigate two\ncoordinated beamforming designs: the quality-of-service (QoS) beamforming and\nthe max-min SINR (signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio) beamforming. The\ngoal of the QoS beamforming is to minimize the total power consumption while\nguaranteeing that received SINR at each user is above a predetermined\nthreshold. We present a necessary condition for the optimization problem to be\nfeasible. Then, based on the decomposition theory, we propose a novel\ndecentralized algorithm to implement the coordinated beamforming with limited\ninformation sharing among different base stations. The algorithm is guaranteed\nto converge and in most cases it converges to the optimal solution. The max-min\nSINR (MMS) beamforming is to maximize the minimum received SINR among all users\nunder per-base station power constraints. We show that the MMS problem and a\nweighted peak-power minimization (WPPM) problem are inverse problems. Based on\nthis inversion relationship, we then propose an efficient algorithm to solve\nthe MMS problem in an approximate manner.

For the differential\nproblem, we prove that the sesquilinear form associated with the Maxwell\nproblem satisfies a generalized weak stability (i.e., inf-sup condition) for\nstar-shaped domains.Such a generalized weak stability readily infers\nwave-number explicit a priori estimates for the solution of the Maxwell\nproblem, which plays an important role in the error analysis for the IPDG\nmethod.

Among the general class of models we consider we\ninclude a supersymmetric example, 6D gauged chiral supergravity. Although much\nof our discussion is more general, we treat in some detail a class of\ncompactifications, where the extra dimensions parametrize a rugby ball shaped\nspace with size stabilized by a bulk magnetic flux. The rugby ball geometry\nrequires two branes, which can host the Standard Model fields and carry both\ntension and magnetic flux (of the bulk gauge field), the leading terms in a\nderivative expansion. The brane properties have an impact on the KK spectrum\nand therefore on the Casimir energy as well as on the renormalization of the\nbrane operators. A very interesting feature is that when the two branes carry\nexactly the same amount of flux, one half of the bulk supersymmetries survives\nafter the compactification, even if the brane tensions are large. We also\ndiscuss the implications of these calculations for the natural value of the\ncosmological constant when the bulk has two large extra dimensions and the bulk\nsupersymmetry is partially preserved (or completely broken).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 09:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 10:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-02"}

We also\nshow how to derive qualitative scaling laws for the reaction time in a\nsystematic way that takes into account the different behaviors of monomer\nmotion at all time and length scales. Finally, we also give an analytical\ndescription of the average elongated shape of the polymer at the instant of the\nreaction and we show that its spectrum behaves a a slow power-law for large\nwave numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 11:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

To\ntry to break this relation alternative new technologies have been proposed,\nsuch as the use of the Integrated Photonic Spectrograph (IPS). Due to their\ndiffraction-limited nature the IPS is claimed to defeat the harsh scaling law\napplying to conventional instruments. In contrast to photonic applications,\ndevices for astronomy are not usually used at the diffraction limit. Therefore\nto retain throughput and spatial information, the IPS requires a photonic\nlantern (PL) to decompose the input multimode light into single modes. This is\nthen fed into either numerous Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) or a\nconventional spectrograph. We investigate the potential advantage of using an\nIPS instead of conventional monolithic optics for a variety of capabilities\nrepresented by existing instruments and others planned for Extremely Large\nTelescopes. We show that a full IPS instrument is equivalent to an\nimage-slicer. However, the requirement to decompose the input light into\nindividual modes imposes a redundancy in terms of the numbers of components and\ndetector pixels in many cases which acts to cancel out the advantage of the\nsmall size of the photonic components. However, there are specific applications\nwhere an IPS gives a potential advantage which we describe. Furthermore, the\nIPS approach has the potential advantage of minimising or eliminating bulk\noptics. We show that AWGs fed with multiple single-mode inputs from a PL\nrequire relatively bulky auxiliary optics and a 2-D detector array. A more\nattractive option is to combine the outputs of many AWGs so that a 1-D detector\ncan be used to greatly reduce the number of detector pixels required and\nprovide efficient adaptation to the curved output focal surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 13:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 09:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

It required radiometers in\nspace to detect the small variations in solar irradiance on timescales of the\nsolar rotation and the solar cycle. A part of the difficulty is that there are\nno other constant natural daytime sources to which the Sun's brightness can be\ncompared. The discovery of solar irradiance variability rekindled a\nlong-running discussion on how strongly the Sun affects our climate. A\nnon-negligible influence is suggested by correlation studies between solar\nvariability and climate indicators. The mechanism for solar irradiance\nvariations that fits the observations best is that magnetic features at the\nsolar surface, i.e. sunspots, faculae and the magnetic network, are responsible\nfor almost all variations (although on short timescales convection and p-mode\noscillations also contribute). In spite of significant progress important\nquestions are still open. Thus there is a debate on how strongly irradiance\nvaries on timescales of centuries (i.e. how much darker the Sun was during the\nMaunder minimum than it is today). It is also not clear how the solar spectrum\nchanges over the solar cycle. Both these questions are of fundamental\nimportance for working out just how strongly the Sun influences our climate.\nAnother interesting question is how solar irradiance variability compares with\nthat of other cool dwarfs, particularly now that observations from space are\navailable also for stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 14:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

As for the X-ray analysis, we confirm\nthat the intracluster medium is mildly elongated, but we also detect three\nX-ray peaks. Two X-ray peaks are offset with respect to the two galaxy peaks\nand lie between them, thus suggesting a bimodal merger caught in a phase of\npost core-core passage. The third X-ray peak lies between the NE galaxy peak\nand a third, minor galaxy peak suggesting a more complex merger.

At the end of Phase 1, the relay\nnode decodes the messages of the source nodes and during Phase 2 transmits a\nmany-to-one function of the decoded messages. Wireless networks in which the\nrelay node decodes, suffer from loss of diversity order if the decoder at the\ndestination is not chosen properly. A novel decoder is proposed for the PNC\nscheme, which offers the maximum possible diversity order of $2,$ for a proper\nchoice of certain parameters and the network coding map. Specifically, the\nnetwork coding map used at the relay is chosen to be a $K$-dimensional Latin\nHypercube, in order to ensure the maximum diversity order of $2.$ Also, it is\nshown that the proposed decoder can be implemented by a fast decoding\nalgorithm.
