We use the classic\nSAR setup with a single antenna emitting signals and receiving the echoes from\nthe scene. The known motion estimation methods for such setups work only in\nsimple cases, with one or a few targets in the same motion. We propose to\nextend the applicability of these methods to complex scenes, by complementing\nthem with a data pre-processing step intended to separate the echoes from the\nstationary targets and the moving ones. We present two approaches. The first is\nan iteration designed to subtract the echoes from the stationary targets one by\none. It estimates the location of each stationary target from a preliminary\nimage, and then uses it to define a filter that removes its echo from the data.\nThe second approach is based on the robust principle component analysis (PCA)\nmethod. The key observation is that with appropriate pre-processing and\nwindowing, the discrete samples of the stationary target echoes form a low rank\nmatrix, whereas the samples of a few moving target echoes form a high rank\nsparse matrix. The robust PCA method is designed to separate the low rank from\nthe sparse part, and thus can be used for the SAR data separation. We present a\nbrief analysis of the two methods and explain how they can be combined to\nimprove the data separation for extended and complex imaging scenes. We also\nassess the performance of the methods with extensive numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 16:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In the hard x-ray regime, achieving large dispersion rates is a\nchallenge.

We analyze this dilemma in the\ncontext of programs operating on collections. Performance-critical code using\ncollections need often to be hand-optimized, leading to non-modular, brittle,\nand redundant code. In principle, this dilemma could be avoided by automatic\ncollection-specific optimizations, such as fusion of collection traversals,\nusage of indexing, or reordering of filters. Unfortunately, it is not obvious\nhow to encode such optimizations in terms of ordinary collection APIs, because\nthe program operating on the collections is not reified and hence cannot be\nanalyzed.\n  We propose SQuOpt, the Scala Query Optimizer--a deep embedding of the Scala\ncollections API that allows such analyses and optimizations to be defined and\nexecuted within Scala, without relying on external tools or compiler\nextensions. SQuOpt provides the same \"look and feel\" (syntax and static typing\nguarantees) as the standard collections API. We evaluate SQuOpt by\nre-implementing several code analyses of the Findbugs tool using SQuOpt, show\naverage speedups of 12x with a maximum of 12800x and hence demonstrate that\nSQuOpt can reconcile modularity and efficiency in real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 16:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-03"}

The\nobservations have been conducted as part of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory M33\nAll-disk survey of Giant Molecular Clouds project (NRO MAGiC). The spatial\nresolutions are 80 pc for 12CO (J=1-0) and 100 pc for 12CO (J=3-2). We detect\n12CO (J=3-2) emission of 65 GMCs successfully.

From these results, we\nspeculate that the R3-2/1-0 values of the GMCs with a low star-forming activity\nmainly depend on the dense gas fraction and not on the temperature, and\ntherefore, the dense gas fraction increases with the mass of GMCs, at least in\nthe GMCs with a low star-forming activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 16:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The jet\n(typical intensity 15 mJy/beam) consists of a $2.5\\arcsec$ straight section\ncontaining two knots, and two additional non-co-linear knots at the end.

A faint feature north-east of the core does not\nappear to be a true counter-jet, but rather an extended lobe of this FR-II\nradio source seen in projection. The absence of a counter-jet is sufficient to\nplace modest constraints on the speed of the jet on these scales, requiring\n$\\beta \\ga 0.5$.

In this paper, branching processes and various\nasymptotic methods for analyzing the stochastic dynamics are further developed\nand used to obtain information on fluctuations, time dependence, and the\ndistributions of sizes of subpopulations, jumps in the mean fitness, and other\nproperties. The focus is on the behavior of a broad class of models: those with\na distribution of selective advantages of available beneficial mutations that\nfalls off more rapidly than exponentially. For such distributions, many aspects\nof the dynamics are universal - quantitatively so for extremely large\npopulations. On the most important time scale that controls coalescent\nproperties and fluctuations of the speed, the dynamics is reduced to a simple\nstochastic model that couples the peak and the high-fitness \"nose\" of the\nfitness distribution.

Interplay between intra- and\ninterband transitions is analyzed for the high-frequency regime of response,\nnear the Pauli blocking threshold. The gate voltage and temperature\ndependencies of the absorption efficiency are calculated. It is demonstrated\nthat for typical parameters, the smearing of the interband absorption edge is\ndetermined by a unscreened part of long-range disorder while the intraband\nabsorption is determined by finite-range scattering. The latter yields the\nspectral dependencies which deviate from those following from the Drude\nformula. The obtained dependencies are in good agreement with recent\nexperimental results. The comparison of the results of our calculations with\nthe experimental data provides a possibility to extract the disorder\ncharacteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 17:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This highly obscured burst begins\nstar-formation-dominated with significant PAH emission, and ends with a ~10^9\nyr period of red near-IR colors. At coalescence, when the AGN is most luminous,\ndust obscures the near-infrared AGN signature, reduces the relative emission\nfrom polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and enhances the 9.7 micron\nabsorption by silicate grains. Although generally consistent with previous\ninterpretations, our results imply none of these indicators can unambiguously\nestimate the AGN luminosity fraction in all cases.

We find that the number of subhalos, when selected using\nthe peak maximum circular velocity in their histories (a property expected to\nbe closely related to the galaxy luminosity), is uncorrelated with the\nformation time of the main halo. This is in contrast to the previously reported\ncorrelation from studies where subhalos are selected by the current maximum\ncircular velocity; we show that this difference is a result of the tidal\nstripping of the subhalos. We also find that the dominance of the main halo and\nthe subhalo mass fraction are strongly correlated with halo concentration and\nformation history. These correlations are important to take into account when\ninterpreting results from cluster samples selected with different criteria.

We make the\nobservation that a scalar resonance coupling to $\\phi \\omega$ unavoidably\ncouples strongly to $K \\bar K$, but no trace of a peak is seen in the $K \\bar\nK$ spectrum of the $J/\\Psi \\to \\gamma K \\bar K$ at this energy. This serves us\nto rule out the interpretation of the observed peak as a signal of a new\nresonance. After this is done, a thorough study is performed on the production\nof a pair of vector mesons and how its interaction leads necessarily to a peak\nin the $J/\\Psi \\to \\gamma \\phi \\omega$ reaction close to the $\\phi \\omega$\nthreshold, due to the dynamical generation of the $f_0(1710)$ resonance by the\nvector-vector interaction. We then show that both the shape obtained for the\n$\\phi \\omega$ mass distribution, as well as the strength are naturally\nreproduced by this mechanism. The work also explains why the $\\phi\\omega$ peak\nis observed in the BES experiment and not in other reactions, like $B^\\pm\\to\nK^\\pm \\phi\\omega$ of Belle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 21:50:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2013 21:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The type 1 which reside\nwithin the AGN region in the BPT diagrams, are offset to lower [SII]/Ha and\n[NII]/Ha luminosity ratios, compared to type 2 AGN.

The\nbroad lines optical FeII is higher for a higher [NII]/Ha, at a fixed L_Bol and\nEddington ratio L/L_Edd.

The phenomenon is viewed as a new nonequilibrium correlation effect\nthat disappears when either interaction or finite bias is absent.

We consider the possibility that electroweak symmetry\nbreaking may be triggered by supersymmetry breaking with a large A_t, large\nenough to generate a composite field with the same quantum numbers as the Higgs\nboson and with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value. In the resulting\nvacuum, the usual relation between the gauge couplings and the Higgs\nself-coupling does not apply, and there is no reason to expect the same upper\nbound on the mass of the lightest Higgs boson.

However, the\norigin of these LABs is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate a\nmerger model for the formation of LABs by studying Lya emission from\ninteracting galaxies at high redshifts by means of a combination of\nhydrodynamics simulations with three dimensional radiative transfer\ncalculations. Our galaxy simulations focus on a set of binary major mergers of\ngalaxies with a mass range of 3-7 *10^12 Msun in the redshift range of z ~ 3\n-7, and we use the newly improved ART^2 code to perform the radiative transfer\ncalculations which couple multi-wavelength continuum, ionization of hydrogen,\nand Lya line emission. We find that intense star formation and enhanced cooling\ninduced by gravitational interaction produce strong Lya emission from these\nmerging galaxies. The Lya emission appears to be extended due to the extended\ndistribution of sources and gas. During the close encounter of galaxy\nprogenitors when the star formation rate peaks at ~ 10^3 Msun/yr, our model\nproduces Lya blobs with luminosity of L ~ 10^42-10^44 erg/s, and size of D ~\n10-20 kpc at z>6 and D ~ 20-50 kpc at z ~ 3, in broad agreement with\nobservations in the same redshift range.

These constraints have been\nsuggested to be the strongest during either early or mid-embryogenesis, which\ncorresponds to the early conservation model or the hourglass model,\nrespectively. Conflicting results have been reported, but in recent studies of\nanimal transcriptomes the hourglass model has been favored. Studies usually\nreport descriptive statistics calculated for all genes over all developmental\ntime points. This introduces dependencies between the sets of compared genes,\nand may lead to biased results. Here we overcome this problem using an\nalternative modular analysis. We used the Iterative Signature Algorithm to\nidentify distinct modules of genes co-expressed specifically in consecutive\nstages of zebrafish development. We then performed a detailed comparison of\nseveral gene properties between modules, allowing for a less biased and more\npowerful analysis. Notably, our analysis corroborated the hourglass pattern\nonly at the regulatory level, with sequences of regulatory regions being most\nconserved for genes expressed in mid-development, but not at the level of gene\nsequence, age or expression, in contrast to some previous studies. The early\nconservation model was supported with gene duplication and birth that were the\nmost rare for genes expressed in early development. Finally, for all gene\nproperties we observed the least conservation for genes expressed in late\ndevelopment or adult, consistent with both models. Overall, with the modular\napproach, we showed that different levels of molecular evolution follow\ndifferent patterns of developmental constraints.

It is therefore\nimportant for the understanding of cluster properties as well as for\ncosmological applications to detect and quantify substructure in X-ray images\nof galaxy clusters. Two promising methods to do so are power ratios and center\nshifts. Since these estimators can be heavily affected by Poisson noise and\nX-ray background, we performed an extensive analysis of their statistical\nproperties using a large sample of simulated X-ray observations of clusters\nfrom hydrodynamical simulations. We quantify the measurement bias and error in\ndetail and give ranges where morphological analysis is feasible. A new,\ncomputationally fast method to correct for the Poisson bias and the X-ray\nbackground contribution in power ratio and center shift measurements is\npresented and tested for typical XMM-Newton observational data sets. We studied\nthe morphology of 121 simulated cluster images and establish structure\nboundaries to divide samples into relaxed, mildly disturbed and disturbed\nclusters.

For this paper, two sunspots and one pore (with a light\nbridge) were chosen as representative examples of MHD waveguides in the lower\nsolar atmosphere. The sunspots and pore display a range of periods from 4 to 65\nminutes. The sunspots support longer periods than the pore - generally enabling\na doubling or quadrupling of the maximum pore oscillatory period.

Classical theory, being\nfully deterministic, completely excludes fundamental randomness. On the\ncontrary, quantum theory allows for randomness within its axiomatic structure.\nYet, the fact that a theory makes prediction only in probabilistic terms does\nnot imply the existence of any form of randomness in nature. The question then\nremains whether one can certify randomness independent of the physical\nframework used. While standard Bell tests approach this question from this\nperspective, they require prior perfect randomness, which renders the approach\ncircular. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to certify full\nrandomness using almost perfect random bits. Here, we prove that full\nrandomness can indeed be certified using quantum non-locality under the minimal\npossible assumptions: the existence of a source of arbitrarily weak (but\nnon-zero) randomness and the impossibility of instantaneous signalling. Thus we\nare left with a strict dichotomic choice: either our world is fully\ndeterministic or there exist in nature events that are fully random. Apart from\nthe foundational implications, our results represent a quantum protocol for\nfull randomness amplification, an information task known to be impossible\nclassically.

The homotopy relation between 2-crossed\nmodule maps will be defined in a similar way to Crans' 1-transfors between\nstrict Gray functors, however being pointed, thus this corresponds to Baues'\nhomotopy relation between quadratic module maps. Despite the fact that this\nhomotopy relation between 2-crossed module morphisms is not, in general, an\nequivalence relation, we prove that if $A$ and $A'$ are 2-crossed modules, with\nthe underlying group $F$ of $A$ being free (in short $A$ is free up to order\none), then homotopy between 2-crossed module maps $A \\to A'$ yields, in this\ncase, an equivalence relation. Furthermore, if a chosen basis $B$ is specified\nfor $F$, then we can define a 2-groupoid $HOM_B(A,A')$ of 2-crossed module maps\n$A \\to A'$, homotopies connecting them, and 2-fold homotopies between\nhomotopies, where the latter correspond to (pointed) Crans' 2-transfors between\n1-transfors.\n  We define a partial resolution $Q^1(A)$, for a 2-crossed module $A$, whose\nunderlying group is free, with a canonical chosen basis, together with a\nprojection map ${\\rm proj}\\colon Q^1(A) \\to A$, defining isomorphisms at the\nlevel of 2-crossed module homotopy groups.

Firstly, it is noted that the\nmodel employed constitutes a generalization of the Hubbard one for the same\nsystem. Thus, the former predictions of the insulator gap, antiferromagnetic\ncharacter and the existence of a paramagnetic-pseudogap state, become natural\nones to be expected from this more general picture. The effect of hole doping\non the antiferromagnetic-insulator state (AFI) and the paramagnetic-pseudogap\none, is investigated. The results predict a quantum phase transition (QPT) from\nthe AFI state at low doping to a paramagnetic-metallic state (PM) at higher\nhole densities. Therefore, a clear description of the hidden QPT laying beneath\nthe dome in high critical temperature superconducting materials is found. At\nlow doping, the system prefers the AFI state, and at the critical value of the\ndoping density 0.2, the energy of a metallic state becomes lower. The evolution\nwith small doping values of the band spectrum of the AFI state, shows that the\nholes tend to become localized at the middle of the sides of the reduced\nBrillouin zone (BZ). Then, around the critical value, the holes of the AFI\nstate move to become situated at the corners of the same reduced BZ, showing a\nstructural change at the phase transition point. Thus, the PM state appearing\nat the QPT acquires the same behavior with respect to the position of holes as\nthe pseudogap state. In the small doping limit a clear difference between the\ndegree of convergence of the iterative self-consistent solution is associated\nto an even or odd number of electrons. It suggests that the Kramers\ndegeneration in combination with the spin-spatial entangled nature of the hole\nstates, leads to a new kind of pair interaction between two holes. The binding\nenergy value is estimated as a function of the screening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 14:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 16:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-27"}

While they\nascribed the anomalous absorption profile to gehlenite (Ca_2Al_2SiO_7, a\ncalcium aluminum silicate species), we propose a physical dust model and argue\nthat, although the presence of gehlenite is not ruled out, the anomalous\nabsorption feature mainly arises from silicon carbide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 15:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Then there exists a constant c such that T L >= c,\nwith c only depending on X. It is known that c >= 6 in any Banach space and\nthat c = 2{\\pi} in any Hilbert space, but whereas the bound of c = 2 pi is\nsharp in any Hilbert space, there exists only one known example of a Banach\nspace such that c = 6 is optimal. In this paper, we show that the inequality is\nin fact strict in any strictly convex Banach space. Moreover, we improve the\nlower bound for l^p(R^n) and L^p(M, {\\mu}) for a range of p close to p = 2 by\nusing a form of Wirtinger's inequality for functions in W^{1,p}([0, T ], L^p(M,\n{\\mu})).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 15:53:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2013 13:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 18:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 16:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-24"}

On a large-scale and real-world database containing customer profiles\nand some transaction data from a telecom company, we first analyzed the data\nschema, developed feature computation strategies and then extracted a large set\nof relevant features that can be associated with the customer churning and\nreturning behaviors. Our features include both the original driver factors as\nwell as some derived features. We evaluated our features on the imbalance\ncorrected dataset, i.e. under-sampled dataset and compare a large number of\nexisting machine learning tools, especially decision tree-based classifiers,\nfor predicting the churners and win-backs. In general, we find RandomForest and\nSimpleCart learning algorithms generally perform well and tend to provide us\nwith highly competitive prediction performance. Among the top-15 driver factors\nthat signal the churn behavior, we find that the service utilization, e.g. last\ntwo months' download and upload volume, last three months' average upload and\ndownload, and the payment related factors are the most indicative features for\npredicting if churn will happen soon. Such features can collectively tell\ndiscrepancies between the service plans, payments and the dynamically changing\nutilization needs of the customers. Our proposed features and their\ncomputational strategy exhibit reasonable precision performance to predict\nchurn behavior in near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 05:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-26"}

The duration of the transient is > ~800 d in\nthe observer frame, and the maximum brightness during observation reached\napproximately 23 mag in the i' and z' bands. The faint host galaxy is clearly\nidentified in all 5 optical bands of the deep SDF images. The photometric\nredshift of the host yields z~0.6 and the corresponding absolute magnitude at\nmaximum is ~-20. This implies that this event shone with an absolute magnitude\nbrighter than -19 mag for approximately 300 d in the rest frame, which is\nsignificantly longer than a typical supernova and ultra-luminous supernova. The\ntotal radiated energy during our observation was 1x10^51 erg. The light curves\nand color evolution are marginally consistent with some of luminous IIn\nsupernova.
