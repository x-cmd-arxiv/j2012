Evolutionary game theory has shown that under certain conditions,\ncooperation nonetheless evolves stably, for example if players have the\nopportunity to punish cheaters that benefit from a public good yet refuse to\npay into the common pool. However, punishment has remained enigmatic because it\nis costly, and difficult to maintain. On the other hand, cooperation emerges\nnaturally in the Public Goods game if the synergy of the public good (the\nfactor multiplying the public good investment) is sufficiently high. In terms\nof this synergy parameter, the transition from defection to cooperation can be\nviewed as a phase transition with the synergy as the critical parameter. We\nshow here that punishment reduces the critical value at which cooperation\noccurs, but also creates the possibility of meta-stable phase transitions,\nwhere populations can \"tunnel\" into the cooperating phase below the critical\nvalue. At the same time, cooperating populations are unstable even above the\ncritical value, because a group of defectors that are large enough can\n\"nucleate\" such a transition. We study the mean-field theoretical predictions\nvia agent-based simulations of finite populations using an evolutionary\napproach where the decisions to cooperate or to punish are encoded genetically\nin terms of evolvable probabilities. We recover the theoretical predictions and\ndemonstrate that the population shows hysteresis, as expected in systems that\nexhibit super-heating and super-cooling. We conclude that punishment can\nstabilize populations of cooperators below the critical point, but it is a\ntwo-edged sword: it can also stabilize defectors above the critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 19:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2013 17:35:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 01:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 17:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

Unfortunately, much\nof this work has necessarily been performed assuming axisymmetry and it remains\nunclear whether or not this compromises those results. In this work, we present\nanalyses of simplified two- and three-dimensional CCSN models with the goal of\ncomparing the multidimensional hydrodynamics in setups that differ only in\ndimension. Not surprisingly, we find many differences between 2D and 3D models.\nWhile some differences are subtle and perhaps not crucial to understanding the\nexplosion mechanism, others are quite dramatic and make interpreting 2D CCSN\nmodels problematic. In particular, we find that imposing axisymmetry\nartificially produces excess power at the largest spatial scales, power that\nhas been deemed critical in the success of previous explosion models and has\nbeen attributed solely to the standing accretion shock instability.\nNevertheless, our 3D models, which have an order of magnitude less power on\nlarge scales compared to 2D models, explode earlier. Since we see explosions\nearlier in 3D than in 2D, the vigorous sloshing associated with the large scale\npower in 2D models is either not critical in any dimension or the explosion\nmechanism operates differently in 2D and 3D. Possibly related to the earlier\nexplosions in 3D, we find that about 25% of the accreted material spends more\ntime in the gain region in 3D than in 2D, being exposed to more integrated\nheating and reaching higher peak entropies, an effect we associate with the\ndiffering characters of turbulence in 2D and 3D.

Our\napproach is by: 1) inferring the mass of their progenitor stars through X-ray\nspectroscopic studies of the thermally emitting supernova ejecta, and 2)\ninvestigating the physical properties of their hosting SNRs and ambient\nconditions. We here highlight our detailed studies of two SNRs: G292.2-0.5\nassociated with the HBP J1119-6127 and Kes 73 associated with the AXP 1E\n1841-045, and summarize the current view of the other (handful)\nHBP/magnetar-SNR associations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 21:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This dense\nQCD matter responds to energy loss in a pattern consistent with that expected\nfrom a hydrodynamic fluid. Further, its elliptic flow measurements suggest that\nthe hadronization of bulk partonic matter exhibits collectivity with effective\npartonic degrees of freedom.

Compared to the algorithms in the\nexisting differential feedback literature, our proposed quantizer provides\nthree advantages: first, the controller parameters are flexible enough to adapt\nthemselves to different vehicle speeds; second, the model is backward adaptive\ni.e., the base station and receiver can agree upon the predictor and variance\nestimator coefficients without explicit exchange of the parameters; third, it\ncan accurately model the system even when the correlation between two\nsuccessive channel samples becomes as low as 0.05.

Our study uses data from the EGS/AEGIS field, where both data\nsets cover an 8'x45' region of the sky. Our measurement is the cross-power\nspectrum between the IR and X-ray data. The cross-power signal between the IRAC\nmaps at 3.6 um and 4.5 um and the Chandra [0.5-2] keV data has been detected,\nat angular scales 20'', with an overall significance of 3.8 sigma and 5.6\nsigma, respectively.

The logarithmic negativity\nE= log||rho_A^{T_2}|| is then the continuation to n->1 of the traces of the\neven powers. For pure states, this procedure reproduces the known results. We\nthen apply this method to conformally invariant field theories in several\ndifferent physical situations for infinite and finite systems and without or\nwith boundaries.

Specifically, the fact that electrons in graphene behave as\nmassless relativistic particles gives rise to unconventional phenomena such as\nKlein tunneling, the anomalous quantum Hall effect, and strain-induced\npseudo-magnetic fields. Graphene edge states play a crucial role in the\nunderstanding and use of these electronic properties. However, the coarse or\nimpure nature of the edges hampers the ability to directly probe the edge\nstates and their band structure. Perhaps the best example is the edge states on\nthe bearded edge (also called the Klein edge) that have thus far never been\nobserved - because such an edge is unstable in graphene. Here, we use the\noptical equivalent of graphene - a photonic honeycomb lattice - to\nexperimentally and theoretically study edge states and their properties. We\ndirectly image the edge states on both the zig-zag and bearded edges of this\nphotonic graphene, measure their dispersion properties, and most importantly,\nfind a new type of edge state: one residing on the bearded edge which was\nunknown and cannot be explained through conventional tight-binding theory. Such\na new edge state lies near the van-Hove singularity in the edge band structure\nand can be classified as a Tamm state lacking any surface defect. Our photonic\nsystem offers the opportunity to probe new graphene-related phenomena that are\ndifficult or impossible to access in conventional carbon-based graphene. Edge\nstates in graphene-type structures play the central role in achieving photonic\ntopological insulation, in which light can propagate along the edges of\nphotonic structures without any parasitic scattering whatsoever.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 09:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

A laser pulse is employed to drive spins from a ferromagnetic\nFe thin film into a nonmagnetic cap layer that has either low (Ru) or high (Au)\nelectron mobility.

This is\na clear sign that the breaking of supersymmetry due to lattice artifacts is\nreduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 12:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

Similar to earlier work we employ a simple mathematical model of\nindependent and identically distributed random variables with a linearly\ngrowing expectation value. This model proved to be useful in predicting the\nincrease (decrease) in upper (lower) temperature records in a warming climate.\nUsing both station and re-analysis data from Europe and the United States we\nfurther investigate the statistics of temperature records and the validity of\nthis model. The most important new contribution in this article is an analysis\nof the statistics of record values for our simple model and European reanalysis\ndata. We estimate how much the mean values and the distributions of record\ntemperatures are affected by the large scale warming trend. In this context we\nconsider both the values of records that occur at a certain time and the values\nof records that have a certain record number in the series of record events. We\ncompare the observational data both to simple analytical computations and\nnumerical simulations. We find that it is more difficult to describe the values\nof record breaking temperatures within the framework of our linear drift model.\nObservations from the summer months fit well into the model with Gaussian\nrandom variables under the observed linear warming, in the sense that record\nbreaking temperatures are more extreme in the summer. In winter however a\nsignificant asymmetry of the daily temperature distribution hides the effect of\nthe slow warming trends. Therefore very extreme cold records are still possible\nin winter.

In doing so, we find that if appropriate surface treatments\nare utilized, the elastic modulus and the piezoelectric properties for ZnO\nnanowires having a variety of axial and surface orientations are all reduced as\ncompared to the bulk value as a result of polarization-reduction in the polar\n[0001] direction. The reduction in effective piezoelectric constant is found to\nbe independent of the expansion or contraction of the polar (0001) surface in\nresponse to surface stresses. Instead, the surface polarization and thus\neffective piezoelectric constant is substantially reduced due to a reduction in\nthe bond length of the Zn-O dimer closest to the polar (0001) surface.\nFurthermore, depending on the nanowire axial orientation, we find in the\nabsence of surface treatment that the piezoelectric properties of ZnO are\neither effectively lost due to unphysical transformations from the wurtzite to\nnon-piezoelectric d-BCT phases, or also become smaller with decreasing nanowire\nsize.

The\nindirect controllability of S will depend on the `dynamical Lie algebra' L\ncharacterizing the dynamics of the total system S+A and on the initial state of\nthe auxiliary system A.

A usual way to achieve a high\nreliability, is to design redundant systems that contain several replicas of\nthe same subsystem or component. State space methods for dependability analysis\nmay suffer of the state space explosion problem in such a kind of situation.\nCombinatorial models, on the other hand, require the simplified assumption of\nstatistical independence; however, in case of redundant systems, this does not\nguarantee a reduced number of modeled elements. In order to provide a more\ncompact system representation, parametric system modeling has been investigated\nin the literature, in such a way that a set of replicas of a given subsystem is\nparameterized so that only one representative instance is explicitly included.\nWhile modeling aspects can be suitably addressed by these approaches,\nanalytical tools working on parametric characterizations are often more\ndifficult to be defined and the standard approach is to 'unfold' the parametric\nmodel, in order to exploit standard analysis algorithms working at the unfolded\n'ground' level. Moreover, parameterized combinatorial methods still require the\nstatistical independence assumption. In the present paper we consider the\nformalism of Parametric Fault Tree (PFT) and we show how it can be related to\nProbabilistic Horn Abduction (PHA). Since PHA is a framework where both\nmodeling and analysis can be performed in a restricted first-order language, we\naim at showing that converting a PFT into a PHA knowledge base will allow an\napproach to dependability analysis directly exploiting parametric\nrepresentation. We will show that classical qualitative and quantitative\ndependability measures can be characterized within PHA. Furthermore, additional\nmodeling aspects (such as noisy gates and local dependencies) as well as\nadditional reliability measures (such as posterior probability analysis) can be\nnaturally addressed by this conversion. A simple example of a multi-processor\nsystem with several replicated units is used to illustrate the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 15:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}

We first briefly introduce the\nGraphical model toolkit (GMTK) and its notion of dynamic graphical models, one\nthat slightly extends the standard notion of a DBN. We next introduce the\n'boundary algorithm', a method to find the best boundary between partitions in\na dynamic model. We find that using this algorithm, the notions of forward- and\nbackward-interface become moot - namely, the size and fill-in of the best\nforward- and backward- interface are identical. Moreover, we observe that\nfinding a good partition boundary allows for constrained elimination orders\n(and therefore graph triangulations) that are not possible using standard\nslice-by-slice constrained eliminations. More interestingly, with certain\nboundaries it is possible to obtain constrained elimination schemes that lie\noutside the space of possible triangulations using only unconstrained\nelimination. Lastly, we report triangulation results on invented graphs,\nstandard DBNs from the literature, novel DBNs used in speech recognition\nresearch systems, and also random graphs.

Specifically, given a co-occurrence matrix of\ntwo variables, one often seeks a compact representation of one variable which\npreserves information about the other variable. We have recently introduced\n``Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction' [GT-2003], a method that extracts\ncontinuous reduced dimensional features whose measurements (i.e., expectation\nvalues) capture maximal mutual information among the variables. However, such\nmeasurements often capture information that is irrelevant for a given task.\nWidely known examples are illumination conditions, which are irrelevant as\nfeatures for face recognition, writing style which is irrelevant as a feature\nfor content classification, and intonation which is irrelevant as a feature for\nspeech recognition. Such irrelevance cannot be deduced apriori, since it\ndepends on the details of the task, and is thus inherently ill defined in the\npurely unsupervised case. Separating relevant from irrelevant features can be\nachieved using additional side data that contains such irrelevant structures.\nThis approach was taken in [CT-2002], extending the information bottleneck\nmethod, which uses clustering to compress the data. Here we use this\nside-information framework to identify features whose measurements are\nmaximally informative for the original data set, but carry as little\ninformation as possible on a side data set. In statistical terms this can be\nunderstood as extracting statistics which are maximally sufficient for the\noriginal dataset, while simultaneously maximally ancillary for the side\ndataset. We formulate this tradeoff as a constrained optimization problem and\ncharacterize its solutions. We then derive a gradient descent algorithm for\nthis problem, which is based on the Generalized Iterative Scaling method for\nfinding maximum entropy distributions. The method is demonstrated on synthetic\ndata, as well as on real face recognition datasets, and is shown to outperform\nstandard methods such as oriented PCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 15:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}

Directed and\nundirected models offer complementary properties in model construction,\nexpressing conditional independencies, expressing arbitrary factorizations of\njoint distributions, and formulating message-passing inference algorithms. We\nshow that the strengths of these two representations can be combined in a\nsingle type of graphical model called a 'factor graph'. Every Bayesian network\nor MRF can be easily converted to a factor graph that expresses the same\nconditional independencies, expresses the same factorization of the joint\ndistribution, and can be used for probabilistic inference through application\nof a single, simple message-passing algorithm. In contrast to chain graphs,\nwhere message-passing is implemented on a hypergraph, message-passing can be\ndirectly implemented on the factor graph. We describe a modified 'Bayes-ball'\nalgorithm for establishing conditional independence in factor graphs, and we\nshow that factor graphs form a strict superset of Bayesian networks and MRFs.\nIn particular, we give an example of a commonly-used 'mixture of experts' model\nfragment, whose independencies cannot be represented in a Bayesian network or\nan MRF, but can be represented in a factor graph. We finish by giving examples\nof real-world problems that are not well suited to representation in Bayesian\nnetworks and MRFs, but are well-suited to representation in factor graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 15:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}

It is a very useful tool for both the modeling and the prediction of\nthose systems for which no previous structural knowledge is available. FIR\nreasoning is based on pattern rules synthesized from the available data. The\nsize of the pattern rule base can be very large making the prediction process\nquite difficult. In order to reduce the size of the pattern rule base, it is\npossible to automatically extract classical Sugeno fuzzy rules starting from\nthe set of pattern rules. The Sugeno rule base preserves pattern rules\nknowledge as much as possible. In this process some information is lost but\nrobustness is considerably increased. In the forecasting process either the\npattern rule base or the Sugeno fuzzy rule base can be used. The first option\nis desirable when the computational resources make it possible to deal with the\noverall pattern rule base or when the extracted fuzzy rules are not accurate\nenough due to uncertainty associated to the original data. In the second\noption, the prediction process is done by means of the classical Sugeno\ninference system.

In this paper a mixed pattern/fuzzy rules strategy is proposed to\ndeal with uncertainty in such a way that the best of both perspectives is used.\nAreas in the data space with a higher level of uncertainty are identified by\nmeans of the so-called error models.

We tested the performance of e-cutoff on three large real Bayesian\nnetworks: ANDES, CPCS, and PATHFINDER. We observed that on each of these\nnetworks the EPIS-BN algorithm gives us a considerable improvement over the\ncurrent state of the art algorithm, the AIS-BN algorithm.
