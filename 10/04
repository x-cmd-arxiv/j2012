Previous determinations of\ntheir 16O/18O ratios showed a rough agreement with FDU expectations; however,\nthe estimated 16O/17O and 12C/13C ratios were lower than in the canonical\npredictions. These anomalies are interpreted as signs of the occurrence of\nnon-convective mixing episodes. We re-investigated this issue in order to\nverify whether the observed data can be reproduced in this hypothesis and if\nthe well determined properties of the two stars can help us in fixing the\nuncertain parameters characterizing non-convective mixing and its physical\nnature. We used high-resolution infrared spectra to derive the 12C/13C and\n16O/17O/18O ratios from CO molecular lines near 5 mu. We also reconsidered the\ndetermination of the stellar parameters to build the proper atmospheric and\nevolutionary models. We found that both the C and the O isotopic ratios for the\ntwo stars considered actually disagree with pure FDU predictions. This\nreinforces the idea that non-convective transport episodes occurred in them. By\nreproducing the observed elemental and isotopic abundances with the help of\nparametric models of nucleosynthesis and mass circulation, we derived\nconstraints on the properties of non convective mixing. We find that very slow\nmixing is incapable of explaining the observed data, which require a fast\ntransport. Circulation mechanisms with speeds intermediate between those\ntypical of diffusive and of convective mixing should be at play. We however\nconclude with a word of caution on the conclusions possible at this stage, as\nthe parameters for the mass transport are rather sensitive to the stellar mass\nand initial composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 16:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Gossip algorithms\nallow nodes only to call one neighbor per round and have recently attracted\nattention as message efficient, simple and robust solutions to the rumor\nspreading problem.\n  Recently, non-uniform random gossip schemes were devised to allow efficient\nrumor spreading in networks with bottlenecks. In particular, [Censor-Hillel et\nal., STOC'12] gave an O(log^3 n) algorithm to solve the 1-local broadcast\nproblem in which each node wants to exchange rumors locally with its\n1-neighborhood. By repeatedly applying this protocol one can solve the global\nrumor spreading quickly for all networks with small diameter, independently of\nthe conductance.\n  This and all prior gossip algorithms for the rumor spreading problem have\nbeen inherently randomized in their design and analysis. This resulted in a\nparallel research direction trying to reduce and determine the amount of\nrandomness needed for efficient rumor spreading. This has been done via lower\nbounds for restricted models and by designing gossip algorithms with a reduced\nneed for randomness. The general intuition and consensus of these results has\nbeen that randomization plays a important role in effectively spreading rumors.\n  In this paper we improves over this state of the art in several ways by\npresenting a deterministic gossip algorithm that solves the the k-local\nbroadcast problem in 2(k+log n)log n rounds. Besides being the first efficient\ndeterministic solution to the rumor spreading problem this algorithm is\ninteresting in many aspects: It is simpler, more natural, more robust and\nfaster than its randomized pendant and guarantees success with certainty\ninstead of with high probability.

In this paper we find a highly significant\nassociation between brightest X-ray sources in the Antennae galaxies and\nstellar clusters.

We study clusters associated with the ULXs\nusing the ESO Very Large Telescope spectra and the Hubble Space Telescope data\ntogether with the theoretical evolutionary tracks and determine their ages to\nbe below 6 Myr.

Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that the method recovers\nthe underlying parameters of both the individuals and the population,\nespecially when compared to commonly employed ordinary least squares\ntechniques, such as the bisector fit. We apply the hierarchical method to\nestimate the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) parameters of a sample of spiral galaxies\ncompiled by Bigiel et al. (2008). We find significant variation in the KS\nparameters, indicating that no single relationship holds for all galaxies. This\nsuggests that the relationship between molecular gas and star formation differs\nbetween galaxies, possibly due to the influence of other properties within a\ngiven galaxy, such as metallicity, molecular gas fraction, or stellar mass. In\nfour galaxies the slope estimates are sub-linear (at the 95% level). We\nestimate the mean index of the KS relationship for the population to be 0.84,\nwith 95% range [0.63, 1.0]. For the galaxies with sub-linear KS relationships,\na possible interpretation is that CO emission is tracing some molecular gas\nthat is not directly associated with star formation. Equivalently, a sub-linear\nKS relationship may be indicative of an increasing gas depletion time at higher\nsurface densities, as traced by CO emission. The Bayesian method can account\nfor all sources of uncertainties, including variations in the conversion of\nobserved intensities to star formation rates and gas surface densities, and is\ntherefore well suited for a thorough statistical analysis of the KS law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 21:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This rotation period is\nlonger than the period we previously measured in 1999, which was itself longer\nthan the period measured in 1988. A nearly linear jet was observed which varied\nlittle during a rotation cycle in both R and CN images acquired during the 1999\nand 2010 apparitions. We measured the projected direction of this jet\nthroughout the two apparitions and, under the assumption that the source region\nof the jet was near the comet's pole, determined a rotational pole direction of\nRA/Dec = 151deg/+59deg from CN measurements and RA/Dec = 173deg/+57deg from\ndust measurements (we estimate a circular uncertainty of 3deg for CN and 4deg\nfor dust).

On cell division the\nmethylation state of the DNA is typically inherited from parent to daughter\ncells. While the chemical bond between the methyl group and the DNA is very\nstrong, changes to the methylation state do occur and are observed to occur\nrapidly in response to external stimulus. The loss of methylation can be active\nwhere enzyme physically breaks the bond, or passive where on cell division the\nnewly constructed strand of DNA is not properly inherited.\n  Here we present a mathematical model of single locus passive demethylation\nfor a dividing population of cells. The model describes the heterogenity in the\npopulation expected from passive mechanisms. We see that even when the site\nspecific probabilities of passive demethylation are independent, conservation\nof methylation on the inherited strand gives rise to site-site correlations of\nthe methylation state. We then extend the model to incorporate correlations\nbetween sites in the locus for demethylation rates. Biologically, correlations\nin demethylation rates might correspond to locus wide changes such as the\ninability of methyltransferase to access the locus. We also look at the effects\nof selection on the multicellular population.\n  The model of passive demethylation not only provides a tool for measurement\nof parameters in loci-specific cases where passive demethylation is the\ndominant mechanism, but also provides a baseline in the search for active\nmechanisms. The model tells us that there are states of methylation\ninaccessible by passive mechanisms. Observation of these states constitutes\nevidence of active mechanisms, either de novo methylation or enzymatic\ndemethylation. We also see that selection and passive demethylation combined\ncan give rise to a stable heterogeneous distribution of gene methylation states\nin a population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 20:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-05"}

For example, the\nintracellular macromolecular composition of fast-growing bacteria changes with\ngrowth rate.

We\nprovide first a swift overview on previous work by diverse authors about these\nannual metrics for the NAtl basin, where the natural variability of the\nphenomenon, the existence of trends, the drawbacks of the records, and the\ninfluence of global warming have been the subject of interesting debates.

It is argued that the individual-storm power dissipation index (PDI)\nconstitutes a natural way to describe each event, and further, that the PDI\nstatistics yields a robust law for the occurrence of tropical cyclones in terms\nof a power law. In this context, methods of fitting these distributions are\ndiscussed. As an important extension to this work we introduce a distribution\nfunction that models the whole range of the PDI density (excluding\nincompleteness effects at the smallest values), the gamma distribution,\nconsisting in a power-law with an exponential decay at the tail. The\ncharacteristic scale of this decay, represented by the cutoff parameter,\nprovides very valuable information on the finiteness size of the basin, via the\nlargest values of the PDIs that the basin can sustain.

The stars in\nthe western half are more reddened than in the southwest quadrant by 0.03-0.04\nmagnitudes.

There is mild evidence that two\nfamilies of extreme HB (EHB) stars (Teff>20000K) could exist, as observed in\nthe field, with ~15% of the objects being helium depleted by a factor of ten\nwith respect to the main population.

These short-distance interactions influence the intrinsic transverse\nmomentum distributions of partons and their correlations at a low normalization\npoint. We study this phenomenon in an effective description of low-energy\ndynamics based on chiral constituent quark degrees of freedom, which refers to\nthe large-N_c limit of QCD. The nucleon is obtained as a system of constituent\nquarks and antiquarks moving in a self-consistent classical chiral field\n(chiral quark-soliton model). The calculated distributions of constituent\nquarks/antiquarks are matched with QCD partons at the scale rho^{-2}. The p_T\ndistribution of valence quarks is localized at p_T^2 ~ R^{-2} and roughly of\nGaussian shape. The sea quark distribution exhibits a would-be power-like tail\n~1/p_T^2 extending up to the chiral symmetry-breaking scale. Such behavior is\nseen in the flavor-singlet unpolarized and nonsinglet polarized sea. The\nhigh-momentum tails are the result of short-range correlations between sea\nquarks in the nucleon's light-cone wave function, analogous to NN correlations\nin nuclei. The nucleon wave function contains correlated pairs of transverse\nsize rho << R with sigma- and pi-like quantum numbers, whose internal wave\nfunctions become identical at p_T^2 ~ rho^{-2} (restoration of chiral\nsymmetry). These features are model-independent and represent an effect of\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the nucleon's partonic structure. Our\nresults have numerous implications for the P_T distributions of particles\nproduced in hard scattering processes. The nonperturbative parton correlations\npredicted here could be observed in particle correlations between the current\nand target fragmentation regions of DIS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 00:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Some of these models have proven successful in generating a\nscenario for exotic spin liquid phases with deconfined spinons. Doping, i.e.\nthe introduction of mobile holes, has been considered within the QDM framework\nand partially studied. A fundamental issue is the possible existence of a\nsuperconducting phase in such systems and its properties. For this purpose, the\nquestion of the statistics of the mobile holes (or \"holons\") shall be addressed\nfirst. Such issues are studied in details in this paper for generic doped QDM\ndefined on the most common two-dimensional lattices (square, triangular,\nhoneycomb, kagome,...) and involving general resonant loops. We prove a general\n\"statistical transmutation\" symmetry of such doped QDM by using composite\noperators of dimers and holes. This exact transformation enables to define\nduality equivalence classes (or families) of doped QDM, and provides the\nanalytic framework to analyze dynamical statistical transmutations. We discuss\nvarious possible superconducting phases of the system. In particular, the\npossibility of an exotic superconducting phase originating from the\ncondensation of (bosonic) charge-e holons is examined. A numerical evidence of\nsuch a superconducting phase is presented in the case of the triangular\nlattice, by introducing a novel gauge-invariant holon Green's function.

In college, we learned that there are much more than\nfour states of matter. For example, there are ferromagnetic states as revealed\nby the phenomenon of magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the\nphenomenon of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are so\nrich that it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the\nsymmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this paper, we will review the progress\nin last 20 -- 30 years, during which we discovered that there are even more\ninteresting phases that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss\nnew \"topological\" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the\nexistence of those new phases - topologically ordered phases. Just like\nzero-viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new \"topological\" phenomena\ndefine the topological order at macroscopic level. As a new type of order,\ntopological order requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion\ncategory and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find that, at\nmicroscopical level, topological order is due to long-range quantum\nentanglements, just like fermion superfluid is due to fermion-pair\ncondensation. Long-range quantum entanglements lead to many amazing emergent\nphenomena, such as fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian\nstatistics, and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range quantum\nentanglements can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons (or more\ngenerally, gauge interactions and Fermi statistics): light waves (gauge fields)\nare fluctuations of long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are\ndefects of long-range entanglements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 02:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Oct 2012 00:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

The idea of a B-ideal is connected\nclosely with generalized-algebraicty originated from semantics for programme\nlanguages. 2.

Manifold learning is usually investigated for dimension\nreduction by preserving some expected local geometric structures from the\noriginal space to a low-dimensional one. The structures are generally\ndetermined by using pairwise distance, e.g., Euclidean distance. Alternatively,\nsparse representation denotes a data point as a linear combination of the\npoints from the same subspace. In practical applications, however, the nearby\npoints in terms of pairwise distance may not belong to the same subspace, and\nvice versa. Consequently, it is interesting and important to explore how to get\na better representation by integrating these two models together. To this end,\nthis paper proposes a novel coding algorithm, called Locality-Constrained\nCollaborative Representation (LCCR), which improves the robustness and\ndiscrimination of data representation by introducing a kind of local\nconsistency. The locality term derives from a biologic observation that the\nsimilar inputs have similar code. The objective function of LCCR has an\nanalytical solution, and it does not involve local minima.

First it does not learn meta-models that provide\nsupport only for the learning algorithm selection task but ones that support\nthe whole data-mining process. In addition it abandons the so called black-box\napproach to algorithm description followed in meta-learning. Now in addition to\nthe datasets, algorithms also have descriptors, workflows as well. For the\nlatter two these descriptions are semantic, describing properties of the\nalgorithms. With the availability of descriptors both for datasets and data\nmining workflows the traditional modelling techniques followed in\nmeta-learning, typically based on classification and regression algorithms, are\nno longer appropriate. Instead we are faced with a problem the nature of which\nis much more similar to the problems that appear in recommendation systems. The\nmost important meta-mining requirements are that suggestions should use only\ndatasets and workflows descriptors and the cold-start problem, e.g. providing\nworkflow suggestions for new datasets.\n  In this paper we take a different view on the meta-mining modelling problem\nand treat it as a recommender problem. In order to account for the meta-mining\nspecificities we derive a novel metric-based-learning recommender approach. Our\nmethod learns two homogeneous metrics, one in the dataset and one in the\nworkflow space, and a heterogeneous one in the dataset-workflow space. All\nlearned metrics reflect similarities established from the dataset-workflow\npreference matrix. We demonstrate our method on meta-mining over biological\n(microarray datasets) problems.

Based on this rule, the corresponding new state estimates are\nexplicitly derived in case of linear observations. Numerical experiments in the\n40-dimensional Lorenz 96 model show that introducing residual nudging to an\nEnKF may improve its accuracy and/or enhance its stability against filter\ndivergence, especially in the small ensemble scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 07:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-05"}

We expand the validity of this conclusion by considering the\nformation of antisite and vacancy point defects, predicting defect formation\nenergies similar in magnitude to Ni3Al. However, in contrast to the Ni3Al\nsystem, we find that substituting Co on Al sites is thermodynamically favorable\nat 0K, consistent with experimental observation of Co excess and Al deficiency\nin \\gamma' with respect to the Co3(Al0.5W0.5) composition. Lastly, we consider\nvibrational, electronic, and magnetic contributions to the free energy, finding\nthat they promote the stability of \\gamma', making the phase thermodynamically\ncompetitive with the convex hull at elevated temperature. Surprisingly, this is\ndue to the relatively small finite-temperature contributions of one of the\n\\gamma' decomposition products, B2 CoAl, effectively destabilizing the Co,\nCoAl, and Co3W three phase mixture, thus stabilizing the \\gamma' phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 10:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-13"}

The shock\ndistribution function contains information on the abundances and strength of\nthe different shocks, and it can be fitted by a double power law with a break\nin the slope around a Mach number of 20. We introduce a generalised scaling\nrelation that correlates the average Mach numbers within the virial radius of\nhaloes and their virial masses.

Many modeling attempts\nuse the well known linear relations for the cooling and emission processes in\nthe jet in a steady-state scenario, albeit the obvious strongly time-dependent\nnature of flares. Due to the feedback of self-produced radiation with\nadditional scattering by relativistic electrons, the synchrotron-self Compton\n(SSC) effect is inherently time-dependent. Although this feedback is usually\nimplemented in numerical treatments, only recently an analytical analysis of\nthe effects of this nonlinear behaviour has been performed. Here, we report our\nresults concerning the effect of the time-dependent SSC on the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of blazars. We calculated analytically the synchrotron and\nthe SSC component, giving remarkably different spectral features compared to\nthe standard linear approach. Adding an external photon field to the original\nsetting, we could implement quite easily the effect of an additional external\nCompton (EC) cooling, since such strong external photon fields are observed in\nflat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ), a subclass of blazars. Calculating the\nresulting flux due to the EC cooling, we were able to show that the resulting\ninverse Compton component strongly depends on the free parameters, and that SSC\ncould potentially have a strong effect in FSRQs, contrary to what is usually\nassumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 10:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

If g\ndenotes the parameter in the Hamiltonian with respect to which the fidelity is\ncomputed, we find that for one-dimensional models with large but finite size,\nthe fidelity susceptibility \\chi_F can detect a QCP provided that the\ncorrelation length exponent satisfies \\nu < 2. We then show that \\chi_F can be\nused to locate a QCP even if \\nu \\ge 2 if we introduce boundary conditions\nlabeled by a twist angle N\\theta, where N is the system size. If the QCP lies\nat g = 0, we find that if N is kept constant, \\chi_F has a scaling form given\nby \\chi_F \\sim \\theta^{-2/\\nu} f(g/\\theta^{1/\\nu}) if \\theta \\ll 2\\pi/N. We\nillustrate this both in a tight-binding model of fermions with a spatially\nvarying chemical potential with amplitude h and period 2q in which \\nu = q, and\nin a XY spin-1/2 chain in which \\nu = 2. Finally we show that when q is very\nlarge, the model has two additional QCPs at h = \\pm 2 which cannot be detected\nby studying the energy spectrum but are clearly detected by \\chi_F. The peak\nvalue and width of \\chi_F seem to scale as non-trivial powers of q at these\nQCPs. We argue that these QCPs mark a transition between extended and localized\nstates at the Fermi energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 10:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2012 09:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The\ntailoring of desired classical photon number distributions is illustrated by\ncreating two representative light sources - one thermal and the other a\nspecific classical, non-Gaussian state. Such generation of classical light\nsources, quite different from existing natural light sources, is likely to be a\nuseful resource in quantum information processing. As a particular application\nin this direction we outline how a non-Gaussian state generated in this manner\nmay be mixed with an appropriate non-classical Gaussian state at a\nbeamsplitter, to generate non-Gaussian entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 12:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2013 07:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

The\ndensity profile of them is steeper than the standard dark matter halos. If the\ndark matter can annihilate or decay into the standard particles, e.g., photons,\nthese objects would be the potential astrophysical sources. In order to be\nconsistent with the observations, such as $Fermi$, the abundance of\nultracompact minihalos must be constrained. On the other hand, the formation of\nthese objects has very tight relation with the primordial curvature\nperturbations on smaller scale, so the fraction of ultracompact minihalos is\nvery important for modern cosmology. In previous works, the studies are focused\non the dark matter annihilation for these objects. But if the dark matter is\nnot annihilated, the dark matter decay is another important possible case. On\nthe other hand, the abundance of ultracompact minihalos is related to many\nother parameters, such as the mass of dark matter, the decay channels and the\ndensity profile of dark matter halo. One of the important aspects of this work\nis that we investigate the $\\gamma$-ray signals from nearby ultracompact\nminihalos due to dark matter decay and another important aspect is to study in\ndetail how the different decay channels and density profiles affect the\nconstraints on the abundance of ultracompact minihalos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 12:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 04:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta may\neventually interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM) via highly energetic\nprocesses detectable in the radio, X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and, sometimes, in\nthe optical domains. In this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and near\ninfrared observations of five type II SNe, namely SNe 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,\n1995ad, and 1996W. Together with few other SNe they form a group of moderately\nluminous type II events. We collected photometry and spectroscopy with several\ntelescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectral\nevolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. Both photometry and\nspectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. The light\ncurves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95<M_{B}<-18.70$).

For SN2007pk we observe a spectral transition from a type IIn to a\nstandard type II SN.

A recent line of research, namely adaptive social recommendation,\nhas therefore emerged to optimize the information propagation in social\nnetworks and provide users with personalized recommendations. Validation of\nthese methods by agent-based simulations often assumes that the tastes of users\nand can be represented by binary vectors, with entries denoting users'\npreferences.

In this paper, we investigate the complexity of\ncomputing the multivariate resultant.\n  First, we study the complexity of testing the multivariate resultant for\nzero. Our main result is that this problem is NP-hard under deterministic\nreductions in any characteristic, for systems of low-degree polynomials with\ncoefficients in the ground field (rather than in an extension).

We show that this matrix belongs to a class\nof succinctly representable matrices, for which testing the determinant for\nzero is proved PSPACE-complete.

However,\nrecent observations have shown evidence of the saturation in greenhouse effect\nof non-CFC gases. A new evaluation has shown that halocarbons alone (mainly\nCFCs) could account for the rise of 0.5~0.6 deg C in global surface temperature\nsince 1950, leading to the striking conclusion that not CO2 but CFCs were the\nmajor culprit for global warming in the late half of the 20th century [Q.-B.\nLu, J.

In addition, the\nhadron-mass spectrum proposed in that theory is confronted with available data.\n  It turns out that all $p_T$-distributions and the mass spectrum obtained in\nthe theory are in good agreement with experiment with constant effective\ntemperature and constant entropic factor. The results confirm that the\nnon-extensive statistics plays an important role in the description of the\ntermodynamics of hadronic systems, and also that the self-consistent principle\nholds for energies as high as those achieved in the LHC.
