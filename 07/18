Careful reconstruction of the SZ signal indicates that most\nclusters are individually detected at least out to R500. By stacking the radial\nprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial SZ signal out to 3 x R500,\ni.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about the\nmean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.\nOur measurement is fully consistent with previous Planck results on integrated\nSZ fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between SZ and X-ray\nmeasurements inside R500. Correcting for the effects of the Planck beam, we\nhave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. This new constraint from\nSZ measurements is consistent with the X-ray constraints from XMM-Newton in the\nregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]R500), and is in fairly good\nagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. At\nlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than most\npredictions from numerical simulations. Combining the SZ and X-ray observed\nprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fit\nparameters [P0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].\nUsing a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirts\nwe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profile\nout to 3 x R500. Within the temperature driven uncertainties, our Planck\nconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gas\nfraction in halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 16:41:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Nov 2012 08:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We perform analyses of 8\ngalaxies out to ~10 R_e, finding that data at 2 R_e are sufficient to estimate\ntotal j_*. Our results contravene suggestions that ellipticals (Es) harbor\nlarge reservoirs of hidden j_* from AM transport in major mergers. We carry out\na j_*-M_* analysis of literature data for ~100 nearby bright galaxies of all\ntypes. The Es and spirals form parallel j_*-M_* tracks, which for spirals is\nlike the Tully-Fisher relation, but for Es derives from a mass-size-rotation\nconspiracy. The Es contain ~3-4 times less AM than equal-mass spirals. We\ndecompose the spirals into disks+bulges and find similar j_*-M_* trends to\nspirals and Es overall. The S0s are intermediate, and we propose that\nmorphological types reflect disk/bulge subcomponents following separate j_*-M_*\nscaling relations -- providing a physical motivation for characterizing\ngalaxies by mass and bulge/disk ratio. Next, we construct idealized\ncosmological models of AM content, using a priori estimates of dark matter halo\nspin and mass. We find that the scatter in halo spin cannot explain the\nspiral/E j_* differences, but the data are matched if the galaxies retained\ndifferent fractions of initial j (~60% and ~10%). We consider physical\nmechanisms for j_* and M_* evolution (outflows, stripping, collapse bias,\nmerging), emphasizing that the vector sum of such processes must produce the\nobserved j_*-M_* relations. A combination of early collapse and multiple\nmergers (major/minor) may account for the trend for Es. More generally, the\nobserved AM variations represent fundamental constraints for any galaxy\nformation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We derive\nanalytical formulae for their TTV signals. We separate planet eccentricity into\nfree and forced parts, where the forced part is purely due to the planets'\nproximity to resonance. This separation yields simple analytical formulae. The\nphase of the TTV depends sensitively on the presence of free eccentricity: if\nthe free eccentricity vanishes, the TTV will be in phase with the longitude of\nconjunctions. This effect is easily detectable in current TTV data. The\namplitude of the TTV depends on planet mass and free eccentricity, and it\ndetermines planet mass uniquely only when the free eccentricity is sufficiently\nsmall. We proceed to analyze the TTV signals of six short period Kepler pairs.\nWe find that three of these pairs (Kepler-18,24,25) have TTV phase consistent\nwith zero. The other three (Kepler-23,28,32) have small TTV phases, but ones\nthat are distinctly non-zero. We deduce that the free eccentricities of the\nplanets are small, < 0.01, but not always vanishing. Furthermore, as a\nconsequence of this, we deduce that the true masses of the planets are fairly\naccurately determined by the TTV amplitudes, within a factor < 2. The smallness\nof the free eccentricities suggests that the planets have experienced\nsubstantial dissipation. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the\nobserved pile-up of Kepler pairs near mean-motion resonances is caused by\nresonant repulsion. But the fact that some of the planets have non-vanishing\nfree eccentricity suggests that after resonant repulsion occurred there was a\nsubsequent phase in the planets' evolution when their eccentricities were\nmodestly excited, perhaps by interplanetary interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 21:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We argue that these results are consistent with\na scenario where LSBGs with blue colors and strong star formation activity at\nthe void walls are fueled by gas from the expanding void regions.

For nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple\nattractors, the quasi-stationary and stationary behavior of such a birth-death\nprocess can be underestood in terms of a separation of time scales by a\n$T^*\\sim e^{\\alpha V}$ $(\\alpha>0)$: a relatively fast, intra-basin diffusion\nfor $t\\ll T^*$ and a much slower inter-basin Markov jump process for $t\\gg\nT^*$.

Previous\ngeneralizations of these methods have been restricted to situations where the\nautomorphic forms in question contribute to a single degree of cohomology. In\npractice, this imposes several restrictions -- one must be in a Shimura variety\nsetting and the automorphic forms must be of regular weight at infinity. In\nthis paper, we essentially show how to remove these restrictions.\n  Our most general result is a modularity lifting theorem which, on the\nautomorphic side applies to automorphic forms on the group GL(n) over a general\nnumber field; it is contingent on a conjecture which, in particular, predicts\nthe existence of Galois representations associated to torsion classes in the\ncohomology of the associated locally symmetric space. We show that if this\nconjecture holds, then our main theorem implies the following: if E is an\nelliptic curve over an arbitrary number field, then E is potentially\nautomorphic and satisfies the Sato--Tate conjecture.\n  In addition, we also prove some unconditional results. For example, in the\nsetting of GL(2) over Q, we identify certain minimal global deformation rings\nwith the Hecke algebras acting on spaces of p-adic Katz modular forms of weight\none. Such algebras may well contain p-torsion. Moreover, we also completely\nsolved the problem (for p odd) of determining the multiplicity of an\nirreducible modular representation rhobar in the Jacobian J_1(N), where N is\nthe minimal level such that rhobar arises in weight two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 22:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jul 2017 01:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

The RT formulation can handle 3D geometrical\nsettings and structured objects with variations and gradients in the optical\ndepths across the objects and along the line-of-sight. The presence of mass\ncauses the intensity variation along the particle bundle ray to be reduced by\nan aberration factor.

The Cu valence is estimated to be ~2.5, well\nbeyond the ~2.3 value for which other High-Tc cuprates are considered to be\noverdoped Fermi liquids. The increase in valence is attributed to the\nadditional 0.5 oxygen ions added per chain upon oxidation.

Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measure the dimming of light as\nthe planets pass in front of their parent star to assess their sizes and\norbital parameters.

For slowly rotating black\nholes, the QNM real frequency is a linear combination of a the orbit's\nprecessional and orbital frequencies, but the correspondence is otherwise\nunchanged. In this paper, we find a relationship between the QNM frequencies of\nKerr black holes of arbitrary (astrophysical) spins and general spherical\nphoton orbits, which is analogous to the relationship for slowly rotating\nholes. To derive this result, we first use the WKB approximation to compute\naccurate algebraic expressions for large-l QNM frequencies. Comparing our WKB\ncalculation to the leading-order, geometric-optics approximation to scalar-wave\npropagation in the Kerr spacetime, we then draw a correspondence between the\nreal parts of the parameters of a QNM and the conserved quantities of spherical\nphoton orbits. At next-to-leading order in this comparison, we relate the\nimaginary parts of the QNM parameters to coefficients that modify the amplitude\nof the scalar wave. With this correspondence, we find a geometric\ninterpretation to two features of the QNM spectrum of Kerr black holes: First,\nfor Kerr holes rotating near the maximal rate, a large number of modes have\nnearly zero damping; we connect this characteristic to the fact that a large\nnumber of spherical photon orbits approach the horizon in this limit. Second,\nfor black holes of any spins, the frequencies of specific sets of modes are\ndegenerate; we find that this feature arises when the spherical photon orbits\ncorresponding to these modes form closed (as opposed to ergodically winding)\ncurves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 02:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-19"}

In such\nmulti-rate WLANs, distributed medium access and rate adaptation are two key\nelements to achieve efficient radio resource utilization, especially in\nnon-cooperative environments. In this paper, we present an analytical study on\nthe non-cooperative multi-rate WLANs composed of selfish users jointly\nadjusting their data rate and contention window size at the medium access level\nto maximize their own throughput, irrespective of the impact of their selfish\nbehaviors on overall system performance. Specifically, we develop an adapted\nTit-For-Tat (TFT) strategy to guide the system to an efficient equilibrium in\nnon-cooperative environments. We model the interactions among selfish users\nunder the adapted TFT framework as a non-cooperative joint medium access and\nrate adaptation game. A systematic analysis is conducted on the structural\nproperties of the game to provide insights on the interaction between rate\nadaptation and 802.11 medium access control in a competitive setting. We show\nthat the game has multiple equilibria, which, after the equilibrium refinement\nprocess that we develop, reduce to a unique efficient equilibrium. We further\ndevelop a distributed algorithm to achieve this equilibrium and demonstrate\nthat the equilibrium achieves the performance very close to the system optimum\nin a social perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 04:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}

The basic\nidea is to solve the original Poisson problem by a two-step procedure: the\nfirst one finds the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ and the second one\ninvolves the solution of potential $\\phi$. The first step exploits loop-tree\ndecomposition technique that has been applied widely in integral equations\nwithin the computational electromagnetics (CEM) community. We expand the\nelectric displacement field in terms of a tree basis. Then, coefficients of the\ntree basis can be found by the fast tree solver in O(N) operations. Such\nobtained solution, however, fails to expand the exact field because the tree\nbasis is not completely curl free. Despite of this, the accurate field could be\nretrieved by carrying out a procedure of divergence free field removal.\nSubsequently, potential distribution $\\phi$ can be found rapidly at the second\nstage with another fast approach of O(N) complexity. As a result, the method\ndramatically reduces solution time comparing with traditional FEM with\niterative method. Numerical examples including electrostatic simulations are\npresented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 04:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}

In this\npaper, we introduce Spot as an accurate and efficient system for multi-entity\nDF detection and tracking. Spot is based on a probabilistic energy minimization\nframework that combines a conditional random field with a Markov model to\ncapture the temporal and spatial relations between the entities' poses. A novel\ncross-calibration technique is introduced to reduce the calibration overhead of\nmultiple entities to linear, regardless of the number of humans being tracked.\nThis also helps in increasing the system accuracy.

Experimental\nevaluation in two typical testbeds, with a side-by-side comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art, shows that Spot can achieve a multi-entity tracking accuracy\nof less than 1.1m. This corresponds to at least 36% enhancement in median\ndistance error over the state-of-the-art DF localization systems, which can\nonly track a single entity. In addition, Spot can estimate the number of\nentities correctly to within one difference error.

If the\nmagneto-rotational instability (MRI) drives turbulence throughout the disc,\nthere is a unique snow line outside of which the disc is icy. The snow line\nmoves closer to the star as the infall accretion rate drops. Because the snow\nline moves inside the radius of the Earth's orbit, the formation of our\nwater-devoid planet is difficult with this model. However, protoplanetary discs\nare not likely to be sufficiently ionised to be fully turbulent. A dead zone at\nthe mid-plane slows the flow of material through the disc and a steady state\ncannot be achieved. We therefore model the evolution of the snow line also in a\ntime-dependent disc with a dead zone. As the mass is accumulating, the outer\nparts of the dead zone become self gravitating, heat the massive disc and thus\nthe outer snow line does not come inside the radius of the Earth's orbit,\ncontrary to the fully turbulent disc model. There is a second, inner icy\nregion, within the dead zone, that moves inwards of the Earth's orbit after a\ntime of about 10^6 yr. With this model there is sufficient time and mass in the\ndisc for the Earth to form from water-devoid planetesimals at a radius of 1 AU.\nFurthermore, the additional inner icy region predicted by this model may allow\nfor the formation of giant planets close to their host star without the need\nfor much migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 07:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The net\neffect of a sequence of instructions, a basic block, can then be calculated by\ncomposing the transfer functions of the constituent instructions. However,\nprecision can be improved by applying a single transfer function that captures\nthe semantics of the block as a whole. Since blocks are program-dependent, this\napproach necessitates automation. There has thus been growing interest in\ncomputing transfer functions automatically, most notably using techniques based\non quantifier elimination. Although conceptually elegant, quantifier\nelimination inevitably induces a computational bottleneck, which limits the\napplicability of these methods to small blocks. This paper contributes a method\nfor calculating transfer functions that finesses quantifier elimination\naltogether, and can thus be seen as a response to this problem.

There is a\ngrowing acceptance in the high-Tc community that the mediating bosons leading\nto Cooper pairing have largely electronic character. At the same time there is\nan increasing acknowledgement that at some level the lattice-charge\ninteractions might be important in cuprates. The experimentally observed\nsubstantially large IE over certain doping range always casts a shadow over any\nproposal where non-phononic mechanism is invoked. Besides, the various existing\ntheoretical schemes, based on electron-phonon interactions, cannot describe the\nanomalous features shown by the IE as a function of hole\nconcentration/disorder, either quantitatively or qualitatively. Based on a\nrecent experiment relating the possibility of Fermi-surface reconstruction to\nthe thermoelectric transport measurements (Nature Commun. 2:432 doi:\n10.1038/ncomms1440 (2011)), we propose here a simple scenario where isotope\nsubstitutions affect the charge/spin stripe state via the coupling to the\nunderlying lattice and thereby change the superconducting Tc. In this picture,\nsignificant part of the IE, over an extended p-range, actually originates from\nthe isotope induced stripe modulation and is not directly related to the\ncharacteristic energy scale of the pairing phonons as is the case in\nconventional BCS theory. Our proposal qualitatively explains all the disorder-\nand p-dependent features of the IE seen in hole doped high-Tc cuprates. We also\nprovide with an outline of some experiments that can verify the degree of\nvalidity of the proposed scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 08:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}

The Curie temperature $T_c$,\nwhich is determined from magnetization and anomalous Hall effect measurements\nby Arrott plots, is found to be proportional to $p^{1/3}$, where p is the hole\ndensity. This fact supports a scenario of RKKY interaction with mean-field\napproximation. This carrier density dependent nature enables tuning and\ncontrolling of the magnetic properties by applying a gate voltage in the future\nscience researches and spintronics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 12:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The approximation guarantee of these algorithms improves\nwith the number of {\\em rounds} $r$ in the hierarchy, though the complexity of\nsolving (or even writing down the solution for) the $r$'th level program grows\nas $n^{\\Omega(r)}$ where $n$ is the input size.\n  In this work, we observe that many of these algorithms are based on {\\em\nlocal} rounding procedures that only use a small part of the SDP solution (of\nsize $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(r)}$ instead of $n^{\\Omega(r)}$). We give an algorithm to\nfind the requisite portion in time polynomial in its size. The challenge in\nachieving this is that the required portion of the solution is not fixed a\npriori but depends on other parts of the solution, sometimes in a complicated\niterative manner.\n  Our solver leads to $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(r)}$ time algorithms to obtain the same\nguarantees in many cases as the earlier $n^{O(r)}$ time algorithms based on $r$\nrounds of the Lasserre hierarchy.

Unit nonresponse is usually dealt with by reweighting: each unit selected\nin the sample has associated a sampling weight and an unknown response\nprobability; the initial sampling weight is multiplied by the inverse of\nestimated response probability. Item nonresponse is usually dealt with by\nimputation. By noting that for a particular survey variable, we just have\nobserved and unobserved values, in this work we exploit the connection between\nunit and item nonresponse. In particular, we assume that the factors that drive\nunit response are the same as those that drive item response on selected\nvariables of interest. Response probabilities are then estimated by using a\nlogistic regression with a latent covariate that measures such will to respond\nand that can explain part of the unknown behavior of a unit to participate in\nthe survey. The latent covariate is estimated using latent trait models. Such\napproach is particularly relevant for sensitive items and, therefore, can\nhandle non-ignorable nonresponse. Auxiliary information known for both\nrespondents and nonrespondents can be included either in the latent variable\nmodel or in the logistic model. The approach can be also used when auxiliary\ninformation is not available, and we focus here on this case.

We find that in contrast to the\neffects of spin anisotropy in the Heisenberg model, spatial anisotropy in the\nAF phase does not suppress the zero temperature regular part of the spin\nconductivity in the zero frequency limit - rather it enhances it. We also\nexplore the finite temperature effects on the Drude weight in the AF phase for\nvarious spatial and spin anisotropy parameters. We find that the Drude weight\ngoes to zero as the temperature approaches zero. At finite temperatures (within\nthe collision less approximation) enhancing spatial anisotropy increases the\nDrude weight value and increasing spin anisotropy decreases the Drude weight\nvalue. In the CAF phase (within the non-interacting approximation) the zero\nfrequency spin conductivity has a finite value for non-zero values of the\nspatial anisotropy parameter. In the CAF phase increasing the spatial\nanisotropy parameter suppresses the regular part of the spin conductivity\nresponse at zero frequency. Furthermore, we find that the CAF phase displays a\nspike in the spin conductivity not seen in the AF phase. Inclusion of the\nsmallest amount of spin anisotropy causes a gap to develop in the spin\nconductivity response of both the AF and CAF phase.

Some analyzes suggest the particles' injection spectrum at source to\nbe as steep as -2.4 to -2.7, making the problem much worse, by a factor of\norder 10^6. Nevertheless, it seems implausible that more than at the very best\n1/3 of the jet energy, goes into the required flux of energetic particles thus,\none would need to allow for the possibility that there is an energy problem,\nwhich we would like to address in this work. Sequences of consecutive oblique\nshock features, or conical shocks, have been theorized and eventually observed\nin many AGN jets. Based on that, we use by analogy the 'Comptonisation' effect\nand we propose a scenario of a single injection of particles which are\naccelerated consecutively by several oblique shocks along the axis of an AGN\njet. We use detailed test-particle approximation Monte Carlo simulations in\norder to calculate particle spectra by acceleration at such a shock pattern\nwhile monitoring the efficiency of acceleration, calculating differential\nspectra. We find that the first shock of a sequence of oblique shocks,\nestablishes a low energy power-law spectrum with ~E^-2.7. The consecutive\nshocks push the spectrum up in energy, rendering flatter distributions with\nsteep cut-offs and characteristic depletion at low energies, an effect which\ncould explain the puzzling apparent extra source power as well as the flat or\ninverted spectra from distant flaring sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 15:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Other charming examples of\nsynchronization can also be found in a wide range of phenomena such as, e.g.,\nneurons firing, lasers cascades, chemical reactions, and opinion formation.\nHowever, in many situations the formation of a coherent state is not pleasant\nand should be mitigated. For example, the onset of synchronization can be the\nroot of epileptic seizures, traffic congestion in communication networks, and\nthe collapse of constructions. Here we propose the use of contrarians to\nsuppress undesired synchronization. We perform a comparative study of different\nstrategies, either requiring local or total knowledge of the system, and show\nthat the most efficient one solely requires local information. Our results also\nreveal that, even when the distribution of neighboring interactions is narrow,\nsignificant improvement in mitigation is observed when contrarians sit at the\nhighly connected elements.

At this point, no unit imaginary enters the\npicture, regardless of whether those forms are over the real or the complex\nfield. Hence, the operator is to be viewed as a real operator. Also a view of\nLie differentiation as a pullback emerges, thus avoiding conceps such as flows\nof vector fields for its definition. Enter Quantum Mechanics based on the\nKahler calculus. Independently of the unit imaginary in the phase factor, the\nproper values of the spin part of angular momentum emerge as imaginary because\nof the idempotent defining the ideal associated with cylindrical symmetry. Thus\nthe unit imaginary has to be introduced by hand as a factor in the angular\nmomentum operator |and as a result also in its orbital part| for it to have\nreal proper values. This is a concept of real operator opposite to that of the\nprevious paragraph. Kahler stops short of stating the antithesis in this pair\nof concepts, both of them implicit in his work. A solution to this antithesis\nlies in viewing units imaginary in those idempotents as being the real\nquantities of square minus 1 in rotation operators of real tangent Clifford\nalgebra. In so doing, one expands the calculus, and launches in principle a\ngeometrization of quantum mechanics, whether by design or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 03:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-25"}
