Moreover,\ntheir centers and their specializations are determined. The constructions\nfollow G. Letzter's theory of quantum symmetric pairs for semisimple Lie\nalgebras.

Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a\nhierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies enable end-users to freely\ncreate and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some\ncontent. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and\nungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than\nincreasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms,\nhomonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they\nintroduce. To address this issue, a variety of approaches have been proposed\nthat recommend users what tags to use, both when labelling and when looking for\nresources.\n  As we illustrate in this paper, real world folksonomies are characterized by\npower law distributions of tags, over which commonly used similarity metrics,\nincluding the Jaccard coefficient and the cosine similarity, fail to compute.\nWe thus propose a novel metric, specifically developed to capture similarity in\nlarge-scale folksonomies, that is based on a mutual reinforcement principle:\nthat is, two tags are deemed similar if they have been associated to similar\nresources, and vice-versa two resources are deemed similar if they have been\nlabelled by similar tags. We offer an efficient realisation of this similarity\nmetric, and assess its quality experimentally, by comparing it against cosine\nsimilarity, on three large-scale datasets, namely Bibsonomy, MovieLens and\nCiteULike.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 16:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

Collaboration is a fundamental assumption and requirement for the correct\noperation of many communication systems. The main challenge when creating\ncollaborative systems in a decentralized manner is dealing with the fact that\nusers may behave in selfish ways, trying to obtain the benefits of the tasks\nbut without participating in their execution. In this context, Game Theory has\nbeen instrumental to model collaborative systems and the task allocation\nproblem, and to design mechanisms for optimal allocation of tasks. In this\npaper, we revise the classical assumptions and propose a new approach to this\nproblem. First, we establish a system model based on heterogenous nodes (users,\nplayers), and propose a basic distributed mechanism so that, when a new task\nappears, it is assigned to the most suitable node. The classical technique for\ncompensating a node that executes a task is the use of payments (which in most\nnetworks are hard or impossible to implement). Instead, we propose a\ndistributed mechanism for the optimal allocation of tasks without payments. We\nprove this mechanism to be robust event in the presence of independent selfish\nor rationally limited players. Additionally, our model is based on very weak\nassumptions, which makes the proposed mechanisms susceptible to be implemented\nin networked systems (e.g., the Internet).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 16:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

All previous analyses of\nsupergranulation have used smaller separations and have been hampered by the\ndifficulty of separating the horizontal and vertical flow components. We find\nthat the large separation travel times associated with supergranulation cannot\nbe studied using the standard phase-speed filters of time-distance\nhelioseismology. These filters, whose use is based upon a refractive model of\nthe perturbations, reduce the resultant travel time signal by at least an order\nof magnitude at some distances.

In this paper, the problem of embedding information on the actions is\nstudied for both the source and the channel coding set-ups. In both cases, a\ndecoder is present that observes only a function of the actions taken by an\nencoder or a decoder of an action-dependent point-to-point link. For the source\ncoding model, this decoder wishes to reconstruct a lossy version of the source\nbeing transmitted over the point-to-point link, while for the channel coding\nproblem the decoder wishes to retrieve a portion of the message conveyed over\nthe link.

Recent\nwork focuses on the class of linear queries, which include basic counting\nqueries, data cubes, and contingency tables. The goal is to maximize the\nutility of their output, while giving a rigorous privacy guarantee. Most\nresults follow a common template: pick a \"strategy\" set of linear queries to\napply to the data, then use the noisy answers to these queries to reconstruct\nthe queries of interest. This entails either picking a strategy set that is\nhoped to be good for the queries, or performing a costly search over the space\nof all possible strategies.\n  In this paper, we propose a new approach that balances accuracy and\nefficiency: we show how to improve the accuracy of a given query set by\nanswering some strategy queries more accurately than others. This leads to an\nefficient optimal noise allocation for many popular strategies, including\nwavelets, hierarchies, Fourier coefficients and more. For the important case of\nmarginal queries we show that this strictly improves on previous methods, both\nanalytically and empirically. Our results also extend to ensuring that the\nreturned query answers are consistent with an (unknown) data set at minimal\nextra cost in terms of time and noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 19:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

However, theoretical uncertainties due to model and parameter\nvariations are not yet well understood, limiting the predictive power of\nsimulations including AGN feedback. By performing a detailed parameter\nsensitivity study in a single cluster using several commonly-adopted AGN\naccretion and feedback models with FLASH, we quantify the model uncertainties\nin predictions of cluster integrated properties. We find that quantities that\nare more sensitive to gas density have larger uncertainties (~20% for Mgas and\na factor of ~2 for Lx at R500), whereas Tx, Ysz, and Yx are more robust\n(~10-20% at R500). To make predictions beyond this level of accuracy would\nrequire more constraints on the most relevant parameters: the accretion model,\nmechanical heating efficiency, and size of feedback region. By studying the\nimpact of AGN feedback on the scaling relations, we find that an\nanti-correlation exists between Mgas and Tx, which is another reason why Ysz\nand Yx are excellent mass proxies.

However, this behaviour changes at scales r < 1 Mpc/h,\nwhere the correlations have similar amplitudes. The amplitude of the two-halo\nterm of the correlation function for objects inside FVS does not depend on\ntheir mass, but rather on that of the FVS.

In order to\ncompare these observational results with current models for structure\nformation, we have performed a similar analysis using a semi-analytic\nimplementation in a LCDM cosmological model.

In addition, much work\nin the literature has invoked this possibility in order to explain observed jet\nstructures and obtain information from these structures. For example, it was\nrecently shown that the observed helical structures in the jet in S5 0836+710\ncould be associated with helical pressure waves generated by Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability. Our aim is to resolve the arc-second structure of the jet in the\nquasar S5 0836+710 and confirm the lack of a hot-spot (reverse jet-shock) found\nby present observing arrays, as this lack implies a loss of jet collimation\nbefore interaction with the intergalactic medium. In this work, we use an\nobservation performed in 2008 using EVN and MERLIN. The combined data reduction\nhas provided a complete image of the object at arc-second scales. The lack of a\nhot-spot in the arc-second radio structure is taken as evidence that the jet\nlosses its collimation between the VLBI region and the region of interaction\nwith the ambient medium. This result, together with the previous identification\nof the helical structures in the jet with helical pressure waves that grow in\namplitude with distance, allow us to conclude that the jet is probably\ndisrupted by the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This observational\nevidence confirms that the physical parameters of jets can be extracted using\nthe assumption that instability is present in jets and can be the reason for\nmany observed structures. Interestingly, the observed jet is classified as a\nFRII object in terms of its luminosity, but its large-scale morphology does not\ncorrespond to this classification. The implications of this fact are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 20:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Moreover, we point out that observation\nof an enhanced emission under weak excitation does not prove that true\nsuperradiance will develop in a fully inverted system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 20:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

The large amount of data available\nfrom the SOHO, STEREO, and future coronagraph missions, also makes manual\ncataloguing of CMEs tedious, and so a robust method of detection and analysis\nis required. This has led to the development of automated CME detection and\ncata- loguing packages such as CACTus, SEEDS and ARTEMIS. Here we present the\ndevelopment of a new CORIMP (coronal image processing) CME detection and\ntracking technique that overcomes many of the drawbacks of current catalogues.\nIt works by first employing the dynamic CME separation technique outlined in a\ncompanion paper, and then characterising CME structure via a multiscale\nedge-detection algorithm. The detections are chained through time to determine\nthe CME kinematics and morphological changes as it propagates across the\nplane-of-sky. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by its\napplication to a selection of SOHO/LASCO and STEREO/SECCHI images, as well as\nto synthetic coronagraph images created from a model corona with a variety of\nCMEs. The algorithms described in this article are being applied to the whole\nLASCO and SECCHI datasets, and a catalogue of results will soon be available to\nthe public.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 20:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-27"}

While the\nbest previously-known general DoF outer bound is consistent with the spatial\ninvariance conjecture, the best previously-known general DoF inner bound,\ninspired by the K user MIMO interference channel, was based on the\ndecomposition of every transmitter and receiver into multiple single antenna\nnodes, transforming the network into an AM X AN user SISO X network. While such\na decomposition is DoF optimal for the K user MIMO interference channel, a gap\nremained between the best inner and outer bound for the MIMO X channel. Here we\nclose this gap with the new insight that the MIMO X network is only one-sided\ndecomposable, i.e., either all the transmitters or all the receivers (but not\nboth) can be decomposed by splitting multiple antenna nodes into multiple\nsingle antenna nodes without loss of DoF. The result is extended to SIMO and\nMISO X networks as well and in each case the DoF results satisfy the spatial\nscale invariance property.

Recently, the buffer has been exploited in\none-way relaying to opportunistically schedule the two different links\naccording to their channel quality. The intuition is that, if the channel to\nthe destination is poor, then RS stores more data from the source, in order to\nuse it when the channel to the destination is good. We apply this intuition to\nthe case of half-duplex two-way relaying, where the interactions among the\nbuffers and the links become more complex.

For downlink transmission, the RS re-encodes and sends using\nthe optimal broadcast strategy.

The 3 directions\nare: Landauer-like theory, kinetic theory and Green-Kubo linear response\ntheory. This thesis is concerned with using NEGF to generalize the 2 directions\nof Landauer-like theory and the kinetic theory.\n  Firstly, NEGF is used to derive phonon-phonon Hedin-like functional\nderivative equations which generates conserving self energy approximations for\nphonon-phonon interaction. Secondly, for the Landauer-like theory, using the\nperturbation expansion, we easily obtain anharmonic (or phonon-phonon\ninteraction) corrections to the ballistic energy current and to the noise\nassociated to the energy current. The lowest 3-phonon interaction, the lowest\nand the second lowest 4-phonon interaction corrections to the ballistic energy\ncurrent are obtained. The lowest 3-phonon interaction correction to the noise\nis obtained. Along a seperate line, we found that we can incooperate high mass\ndisorder into the ballistic energy current formula. The coherent potential\napproximation (CPA) for treating high mass disorder is found to be compatible\nwith the ballistic energy current expression.\n  Lastly, for the kinetic theory, Wigner coordinates + gradient expansion\neasily allow the reproduction of the usual phonon Boltzmann kinetic equation.\nIt is also straightforward to derive phonon-phonon correlation corrections to\nkinetic equations.

RCPs are convex optimization problems with a (usually large)\nnumber N of randomly extracted constraints; they arise in several applicative\nareas, especially in the context of decision under uncertainty, see [2],[3]. We\nhere consider a setup in which instances of the random constraints (the\nscenario) are not held by a single centralized processing unit, but are\ndistributed among different nodes of a network. Each node \"sees\" only a small\nsubset of the constraints, and may communicate with neighbors. The objective is\nto make all nodes converge to the same solution as the centralized RCP problem.\nTo this end, we develop two distributed algorithms that are variants of the\nconstraints consensus algorithm [4],[5]: the active constraints consensus (ACC)\nalgorithm, and the vertex constraints consensus (VCC) algorithm. We show that\nthe ACC algorithm computes the overall optimal solution in finite time, and\nwith almost surely bounded communication at each iteration. The VCC algorithm\nis instead tailored for the special case in which the constraint functions are\nconvex also w.r.t. the uncertain parameters, and it computes the solution in a\nnumber of iterations bounded by the diameter of the communication graph. We\nfurther devise a variant of the VCC algorithm, namely quantized vertex\nconstraints consensus (qVCC), to cope with the case in which communication\nbandwidth among processors is bounded. We discuss several applications of the\nproposed distributed techniques, including estimation, classification, and\nrandom model predictive control, and we present a numerical analysis of the\nperformance of the proposed methods. As a complementary numerical result, we\nshow that the parallel computation of the scenario solution using ACC algorithm\nsignificantly outperforms its centralized equivalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 10:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-27"}

This arises in\nrandom flows due to a finite response time of the mean emf to changes in the\nmean magnetic field, and leads to the telegraph equation for the mean field.\nThe resulting dynamo model also includes the nonlinear dynamo effects arising\nfrom magnetic helicity balance. Within this framework, coherent large-scale\nmagnetic spiral arms superimposed on the dominant axially symmetric magnetic\nstructure are considered. A non-axisymmetric forcing of the mean-field dynamo\nby a spiral pattern (either stationary or transient) is invoked, with the aim\nof explaining the phenomenon of magnetic arms. For a stationary dynamo forcing\nby a rigidly rotating material spiral, we find corotating non-axisymmetric\nmagnetic modes enslaved to the axisymmetric modes and strongly peaked around\nthe corotation radius. For a forcing by transient material arms wound up by the\ngalactic differential rotation, the magnetic spiral is able to adjust to the\nwinding so that it resembles the material spiral at all times. There are\nprofound effects associated with the temporal non-locality, i.e. finite `dynamo\nrelaxation time'. For the case of a rigidly rotating spiral, a finite\nrelaxation time causes each magnetic arm to mostly lag the corresponding\nmaterial arm with respect to the rotation. For a transient material spiral that\nwinds up, the finite dynamo relaxation time leads to a large, negative (in the\nsense of the rotation) phase shift between the magnetic and material arms,\nsimilar to that observed in NGC 6946 and other galaxies.

One\nappealing methodology to implement a compression of $G$ is to construct a\n\\emph{mimicking network}: a small network $G'$ with the same $k$ terminals, in\nwhich the minimum cut value between every bipartition of terminals is the same\nas in $G$. This notion was introduced by Hagerup, Katajainen, Nishimura, and\nRagde [JCSS '98], who proved that such $G'$ of size at most $2^{2^k}$ always\nexists. Obviously, by having access to the smaller network $G'$, certain\ncomputations involving cuts can be carried out much more efficiently.\n  We provide several new bounds, which together narrow the previously known gap\nfrom doubly-exponential to only singly-exponential, both for planar and for\ngeneral graphs. Our first and main result is that every $k$-terminal planar\nnetwork admits a mimicking network $G'$ of size $O(k^2 2^{2k})$, which is\nmoreover a minor of $G$. On the other hand, some planar networks $G$ require\n$|E(G')| \\ge \\Omega(k^2)$. For general networks, we show that certain bipartite\ngraphs only admit mimicking networks of size $|V(G')| \\geq 2^{\\Omega(k)}$, and\nmoreover, every data structure that stores the minimum cut value between all\nbipartitions of the terminals must use $2^{\\Omega(k)}$ machine words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 11:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-27"}

A fundamental open question in theoretical neuroscience pertains to\nhow this deadlock may be resolved. In order to tackle this problem, we first\ndefine the notion of a \"excitable neuron model\". Then we analytically derive\nthe input-output relation of such neuronal models, relating input spike trains\nto output spikes based on known biophysical properties. Thus we obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the mean firing rates, all second order statistics\n(input-state-output correlation and spectra) and construct optimal linear\nestimators for the neuronal response and internal state.

Here, radical voters are more persuasive than centrists, whose\nsub-population consists of susceptible agents C and a fraction zeta of centrist\nzealots Cz.

As exemplified by RX\nJ1713.7-3946, the nature of this emission has been hotly debated, and direct\nevidence for the efficient acceleration of cosmic-ray protons at the SNR shocks\nstill remains elusive. We analyzed more than 40 months of data acquired by the\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope in the\nHE domain, and gathered all of the relevant multi-wavelength (from radio to VHE\ngamma-rays) information about the broadband nonthermal emission from RCW 86.\nFor this purpose, we re-analyzed the archival X-ray data from the ASCA/Gas\nImaging Spectrometer (GIS), the XMM-Newton/EPIC-MOS, and the RXTE/Proportional\nCounter Array (PCA). Beyond the expected Galactic diffuse background, no\nsignificant gamma-ray emission in the direction of RCW 86 is detected in any of\nthe 0.1-1, 1-10 and 10-100 GeV Fermi-LAT maps. In the hadronic scenario, the\nderived HE upper limits together with the HESS measurements in the VHE domain\ncan only be accommodated by a spectral index Gamma <= 1.8, i.e. a value\nin-between the standard (test-particle) index and the asymptotic limit of\ntheoretical particle spectra in the case of strongly modified shocks. The\ninterpretation of the gamma-ray emission by inverse Compton scattering of high\nenergy electrons reproduces the multi-wavelength data using a reasonable value\nfor the average magnetic field of 15-25 muG.

Seven intense gamma-ray\nevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or two\ndays.

However, there is still much debate about the value\nof such approaches in real settings. In this paper, we show that the value of\ndynamic resizing is highly dependent on statistics of the workload process. In\nparticular, both slow time-scale non-stationarities of the workload (e.g., the\npeak-to-mean ratio) and the fast time-scale stochasticity (e.g., the burstiness\nof arrivals) play key roles. To illustrate the impact of these factors, we\ncombine optimization-based modeling of the slow time-scale with stochastic\nmodeling of the fast time scale. Within this framework, we provide both\nanalytic and numerical results characterizing when dynamic resizing does (and\ndoes not) provide benefits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 15:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 06:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

The two lowest orders of\nthis expansion produce the equation for T_c and the GL theory. It is shown that\nin agreement with previous studies, the two-band GL theory maps onto the\nsingle-band GL model and thus fails to describe the difference in the spatial\nprofiles of the two band condensates. We prove that except for some very\nspecial cases, this difference appears already in the leading correction to the\nGL theory, which constitutes the extended GL formalism. We derive linear\ndifferential equations that determine the leading corrections to the band order\nparameters and magnetic field, discuss the validity of these equations, and\nconsider examples of an important interplay between the band condensates.\nFinally, we present numerical results for the thermodynamic critical magnetic\nfield and temperature-dependent band gaps (at zero field), which are in a very\ngood agreement with those obtained from the full BCS approach in a wide\ntemperature range.

Black hole-neutron star binaries are amongst the\nmost likely progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts --- as long as massive\n(probably a few percents of a solar mass), hot accretion disks are formed\naround the black hole. Whether this actually happens strongly depends on the\nphysical characteristics of the system, and in particular on the mass ratio,\nthe spin of the black hole, and the radius of the neutron star. We present here\na simple two-parameter model, fitted to existing numerical results, for the\ndetermination of the mass remaining outside the black hole a few milliseconds\nafter a black hole-neutron star merger (i.e. the combined mass of the accretion\ndisk, the tidal tail, and the potential ejecta).

We focus on A(1,0) case and we find first that it\ncan be related to intersecting complex cycles with genus $g$. Using toric\ngeometry, A(1,0) quivers are analyzed in some details and it is shown that\nA(1,0) can be used to incorporate fundamental fields to a product of two\nunitary factor groups. We expect that this approach can be applied to other\nkinds of Lie superalgebras;\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 15:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}

Using the thermodynamic socio-physical traffic model with\nshort-ranged repulsion between particles (originally introduced in [Physica A\n\\textbf{333} (2004) 370]) we firstly derive the time-clearance distribution in\nthe model. Consecutively, the statistical distributions for the so-called time\nmulti-clearances are calculated by means of theory of functional convolutions.\nMoreover, all the theoretical surmises used during the above-mentioned\ncalculations are proven by the statistical analysis of traffic data. The\nmathematical predictions acquired in this paper are thoroughly compared with\nrelevant empirical quantities and discussed in the context of three-phase\ntraffic theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 09:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 12:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
