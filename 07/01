In addition, existing monitoring-based storage\nmanagement by access pattern detections has difficulties to handle workloads\nthat are highly dynamic and concurrent. To achieve high performance by best\nutilizing heterogeneous storage devices, we have designed and implemented a\nheterogeneity-aware software framework for DBMS storage management called\nhStorage-DB, where semantic information that is critical for storage I/O is\nidentified and passed to the storage manager. According to the collected\nsemantic information, requests are classified into different types. Each type\nis assigned a proper QoS policy supported by the underlying storage system, so\nthat every request will be served with a suitable storage device. With\nhStorage-DB, we can well utilize semantic information that cannot be detected\nthrough data access monitoring but is particularly important for a hybrid\nstorage system. To show the effectiveness of hStorage-DB, we have implemented a\nsystem prototype that consists of an I/O request classification enabled DBMS,\nand a hybrid storage system that is organized into a two-level caching\nhierarchy. Our performance evaluation shows that hStorage-DB can automatically\nmake proper decisions for data allocation in different storage devices and make\nsubstantial performance improvements in a cost-efficient way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2012 20:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

A practical solution to the\nproblem has been proposed aggregating the bandwidth of 802.11 Access Points\n(APs) backhauls in range via 802.11 connections. Since 802.11 devices are\nusually single-radio, the communication to multiple APs on different\nradio-channels requires the introduction of a time-division multiple access\n(TDMA) policy at the client station. Current investigation in this area\nsupposes that there is a sufficient number of TCP flows to saturate the\nAsymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) behind the APs. However, this may be\nnot guaranteed according to the user traffic pattern. As a consequence, a TDMA\npolicy introduces additional delays in the end-to-end transmissions that will\ncause degradation of the TCP throughput and an under-utilization of the AP\nbackhauls. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth experimental analysis\nwith a customized 802.11 driver of how the usage of multi-AP TDMA affects the\nobserved Round-Trip-Time (RTT) of TCP flows. Then, we introduce a simple\nanalytical model that accurately predicts the TCP RTT when accessing the\nwireless medium with a Multi-AP TDMA policy. Based on this model, we propose a\nresource allocation algorithm that runs locally at the station and it greatly\nreduces the observed TCP RTT with a very low computational cost. Our proposed\nscheme can improve up to 1:5 times the aggregate throughput observed by the\nstation compared to state-of-the-art multi-AP TDMA allocations.

Using the\nproposed solution procedure, we investigate the computational efficiency\nafforded by higher-order finite-element discretization of the Kohn-Sham DFT\nproblem. Our studies suggest that staggering computational savings of the order\nof 1000 fold relative to linear finite-elements can be realized, for both\nall-electron and local pseudopotential calculations. On all the benchmark\nsystems studied, we observe diminishing returns in computational savings beyond\nthe sixth-order for accuracies commensurate with chemical accuracy. A\ncomparative study of the computational efficiency of the proposed higher-order\nfinite-element discretizations suggests that the performance of finite-element\nbasis is competing with the plane-wave discretization for non-periodic local\npseudopotential calculations, and compares to the Gaussian basis for\nall-electron calculations within an order of magnitude. Further, we demonstrate\nthe capability of the proposed approach to compute the electronic structure of\na metallic system containing 1688 atoms using modest computational resources,\nand good scalability of the present implementation up to 192 processors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2012 23:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 14:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2012 17:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 16:12:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2013 04:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

To this aim, we build the Principal Curve (P-curve) passing\nthrough the spine of the data point cloud, considering the eigenspace derived\nfrom Principal Component Analysis of morphological, physical and photometric\ngalaxy properties. Thus, galaxies can be labeled, ranked and classified by a\nsingle arc length value of the curve, measured at the unique closest projection\nof the data points on the P-curve. We find that the P-curve has a \"W\" letter\nshape with 3 turning points, defining 4 branches that represent distinct galaxy\npopulations. This behavior is controlled mainly by 2 properties, namely u-r and\nSFR. We further present the variations of several galaxy properties as a\nfunction of arc length. Luminosity functions variate from steep Schechter fits\nat low arc length, to double power law and ending in Log-normal fits at high\narc length. Galaxy clustering shows increasing autocorrelation power at large\nscales as arc length increases. PCA analysis allowed to find peculiar galaxy\npopulations located apart from the main cloud of data points, such as small red\ngalaxies dominated by a disk, of relatively high stellar mass-to-light ratio\nand surface mass density. The P-curve allows not only dimensionality reduction,\nbut also provides supporting evidence for relevant physical models and\nscenarios in extragalactic astronomy: 1) Evidence for the hierarchical merging\nscenario in the formation of a selected group of red massive galaxies. These\ngalaxies present a log-normal r-band luminosity function, which might arise\nfrom multiplicative processes involved in this scenario. 2) Connection between\nthe onset of AGN activity and star formation quenching, which appears in green\ngalaxies when transitioning from blue to red populations.

The critical\nexponent of the correlation length is found to be $\\nu \\approx 1.0$. This\nimplies that the fermionic Mott transition, belongs to the universality class\nof the 2D Ising model.

These\nfunctions depend on a single complex variable and its conjugate, (w,w*). Using\nthese functions, and formulas due to Fadin, Lipatov and Prygarin, we determine\nthe six-gluon MHV remainder function in the leading-logarithmic approximation\n(LLA) in this limit through ten loops, and the next-to-LLA (NLLA) terms through\nnine loops. In separate work, we have determined the symbol of the four-loop\nremainder function for general kinematics, up to 113 constants. Taking its\nmulti-Regge limit and matching to our four-loop LLA and NLLA results, we fix\nall but one of the constants that survive in this limit. The multi-Regge limit\nfactorizes in the variables (\\nu,n) which are related to (w,w*) by a\nFourier-Mellin transform. We can transform the single-valued harmonic\npolylogarithms to functions of (\\nu,n) that incorporate harmonic sums,\nsystematically through transcendental weight six. Combining this information\nwith the four-loop results, we determine the eigenvalues of the BFKL kernel in\nthe adjoint representation to NNLLA accuracy, and the MHV product of impact\nfactors to NNNLLA accuracy, up to constants representing beyond-the-symbol\nterms and the one symbol-level constant. Remarkably, only derivatives of the\npolygamma function enter these results.

We also tested the Y-K/g-z selection criterion\nwith the SDSS-III/DR9 quasar catalog, and found 96.2% of 17,999 DR9 quasars\nwith UKIDSS Y and K-band data satisfy our criterion. With some samples of red\nand type II quasars, we found that 88% and 96.5% of them can be selected by the\nY-K/g-z criterion respectively, which supports that using the Y-K/g-z criterion\nwe can efficiently select both unobscured and obscured quasars.
