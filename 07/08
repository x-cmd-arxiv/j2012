We present a radiative-transfer,\nspatio-kinematic modeling of the molecular envelope of the young planetary\nnebula NGC 7027 in high- and low-J 12CO and 13CO transitions observed by\nHerschel/HIFI and IRAM 30-m, and discuss the structure and dynamics of the\nmolecular envelope.\n  We have developed a code which, used along with the existing SHAPE software,\nimplements spatio-kinematic modeling with accurate non-LTE calculations of line\nexcitation and radiative transfer in molecular species. We have used this code\nto build a relatively simple \"russian doll\" model of the molecular envelope of\nNGC 7027.\n  The model nebula consists of four nested, mildly bipolar shells plus a pair\nof high-velocity blobs. The innermost shell is the thinnest and shows a\nsignificant jump in physical conditions (temperature, density, abundance and\nvelocity) with respect to the adjacent shell. This is a clear indication of a\nshock front in the system. Each of the high-velocity blobs is divided into two\nsections with different physical conditions. The presence of H2O in NGC 7027, a\nC-rich nebula, is likely due to photo-induced chemistry from the hot central\nstar. The computed molecular mass of the nebula is 1.3 Msun, compatible with\nestimates from previous works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2012 20:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

As it is well\nknown, there is a continuous exponential tendency of microelectronics towards\nminiaturization summarized in G. Moore's empirical law. There is consensus that\nthe corresponding decrease in size must end in 10 to 15 years due to physical\nas well as economical limits. It is thus necessary to prepare new solutions if\none wants to pursue this trend further. One approach is to start from the\nultimate limit, i.e. the atomic level, and design new materials and components\nwhich will replace the present day MOS (metal-oxide-semi- conductor) based\ntechnology. This is exactly the essence of nanotechnology, i.e. the ability to\nwork at the molecular level, atom by atom or molecule by molecule, to create\nlarger structures with fundamentally new molecular orga- nization. This should\nlead to novel materials with improved physical, chemi- cal and biological\nproperties. These properties can be exploited in new devices. Such a goal would\nhave been thought out of reach 15 years ago but the advent of new tools and new\nfabrication methods have boosted the field. We want to give here an overview of\ntwo different subfields of nano- electronics. The first part is centered on\ninorganic materials and describes two aspects: i) the physical and economical\nlimits of the tendency to miniaturiza- tion; ii) some attempts which have\nalready been made to realize devices with nanometric size.

First, we\ndemonstrate that left-handed metamaterials can significantly suppress\nlocalization of light and lead to an anomalously enhanced transmission. This\nsuppression is essential at the long-wavelength limit in the case of normal\nincidence, at specific angles of oblique incidence (Brewster anomaly), and in\nthe vicinity of the zero-epsilon or zero-mu frequencies for dispersive\nmetamaterials. Remarkably, in disordered samples comprised of alternating\nnormal and left-handed metamaterials, the reciprocal Lyapunov exponent and\nreciprocal transmittance increment can differ from each other. Second, we study\nmagneto-active multilayered structures, which exhibit nonreciprocal\nlocalization of light depending on the direction of propagation and on the\npolarization. At resonant frequencies or realizations, such nonreciprocity\nresults in effectively unidirectional transport of light. Third, we discuss the\nanalogy between the wave propagation through multilayered samples with\nmetamaterials and the charge transport in graphene, which enables a simple\nphysical explanation of unusual conductive properties of disordered graphene\nsuperlatices. We predict disorder-induced resonances of the transmission\ncoefficient at oblique incidence of the Dirac quasiparticles. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that an interplay of nonlinearity and disorder in dielectric media\ncan lead to bistability of individual localized states excited inside the\nmedium at resonant frequencies. This results in nonreciprocity of the wave\ntransmission and unidirectional transport of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 07:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Along the\nway we solve a problem in the classical one-variable operator theory. We use a\n\"pull back\" technique to prove that a completely non-unitary Gamma-contraction\n(S, P) can be dilated to a direct sum of a Gamma-isometry and a Gamma-unitary\non the Sz.-Nagy and Foias functional model of P, and that (S, P) can be\nrealized as a compression of the above pair in the functional model of P.\nMoreover, we show that the representation is unique. We prove that a commuting\ntuple (S, P) with |S| \\leq 2 and |P \\leq 1 is a Gamma-contraction if and only\nif there exists a compressed scalar operator X with the decompressed numerical\nradius not greater than one such that S = X + P X^*. In the commutant lifting\nset up, we obtain a unique and explicit solution to the lifting of S where (S,\nP) is a completely non-unitary Gamma-contraction. Our results concerning the\nBeurling-Lax-Halmos theorem of Gamma-isometries and the functional model of\nGamma-contractions answers a pair of questions of J. Agler and N. J. Young.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 11:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 20:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 07:59:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 06:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 15:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

In neuroscience, the membrane potential\nevolution in single neurons can be measured at high frequency, but biophysical\nrealistic models have to include the unobserved dynamics of ion channels. One\nsuch model is the stochastic Morris-Lecar model, defined by a nonlinear\ntwo-dimensional stochastic differential equation. The coordinates are coupled,\nthat is, the unobserved coordinate is nonautonomous, the model exhibits\noscillations to mimic the spiking behavior, which means it is not of\ngradient-type, and the measurement noise from intracellular recordings is\ntypically negligible. Therefore, the hidden Markov model framework is\ndegenerate, and available methods break down. The main contributions of this\npaper are an approach to estimate in this ill-posed situation and nonasymptotic\nconvergence results for the method. Specifically, we propose a sequential Monte\nCarlo particle filter algorithm to impute the unobserved coordinate, and then\nestimate parameters maximizing a pseudo-likelihood through a stochastic version\nof the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It turns out that even the rate\nscaling parameter governing the opening and closing of ion channels of the\nunobserved coordinate can be reasonably estimated.

A century ago Norwegian experimental physicist\nKristian Birkeland, one of the founding fathers of modern space science,\ndemonstrated with his Terrella experiment the formation of the aurora.

Today, nine\nPlaneterrellas are operating or under construction in four different countries,\nand more are in the pipleline.

In the present notes we extend the\nnotion of an exponent of the W-action introduced in [Baek-Neher-Zainoulline,\narXiv:1106.4332] to the context of an arbitrary algebraic oriented cohomology\ntheory of Levine-Morel, Panin-Smirnov and the associated formal group law. From\nthis point of view the classical Dynkin index of the associated Lie algebra\nwill be the second exponent of the deformation map from the multiplicative to\nthe additive formal group law. We apply this generalized exponent to study the\ntorsion part of an arbitrary oriented cohomology theory of a twisted flag\nvariety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 15:31:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2012 02:23:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 17:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

The ensuing noise spectrum is found to\ndecrease linearly from zero frequency to 2W, and it is zero for frequencies\ngreater than 2W. Analogous calculations performed for the square of a single\nGaussian noise confirm earlier results. The spectrum at non-zero frequencies,\nand the variance of the square of a noise, is amplified by a factor two as a\nconsequence of correlation effects between frequency products. Our analytic\nresults is corroborated by computer simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 15:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-07"}
