We use data in the\nCDFS, obtained in intermediate and broad band filters by the MUSYC project, to\nsample the UV rest-frame of 751 galaxies with 0.95<z<2.2. When available,\nHerschel/PACS data (GOODS-Herschel project), and Spitzer/MIPS measurements, are\nused to estimate the dust emission. The SED of each source is fit using the\nCIGALE code. The amount of dust attenuation and the dust attenuation curve are\nobtained as outputs of the SED fitting process, together with other parameters\nlinked to the SFH. The global amount of dust attenuation at UV wavelengths is\nfound to increase with stellar mass and to decrease as UV luminosity increases.\nA UV bump at 2175A is securely detected in 20% of the galaxies, and the mean\namplitude of the bump for the sample is similar to that observed in the LMC\nsupershell region. This amplitude is found to be lower in galaxies with very\nhigh SSFRs, and 90% of the galaxies exhibiting a secure bump are at z<1.5.

To explain the lack of short-period giant planets\nin globular clusters (GC), such as 47 Tucane and \\omega\\ Centauri, it has been\nsuggested that their low metallicities may have prevented planet formation.\nAlternatively, the high rates of close stellar encounters in these clusters may\nhave influenced the formation and subsequent evolution of planetary systems.\nHow common are planets in clusters around normal main-sequence stars? Here we\nconsider whether this question can be addressed using data from the Kepler\nmission. The Kepler field of view contains 4 low-density (relative to GCs) open\nclusters where the metallicities are about solar (or even higher) and stellar\nencounters are much less frequent than in typical GCs.

In addition to massive\ncellular depolarization, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and\nmetabolism -- aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to\ntraumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine.\n  In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on\nmodeling the features essential to understanding the implications of\nneurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium--ATPase,\nmainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a\nrate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is\ndetermined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an\neffective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium\nconcentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex\nexceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of\nvascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation\nplay important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model\nreplicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD --\nvasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation,\nprolonged depolarization -- found in experimental studies.\n  We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the\ncontribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the\nvariability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These\nresults have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more\nprecise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly\nrelevant to neurological disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 02:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 21:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

This is\nevidenced by the fact that the magnetic permeability of nearly all materials is\nunity in the optical frequency range, and that magneto-optical devices (such as\nFaraday isolators) must be large in order to allow for a sufficiently strong\neffect. In graphene, however, it has been shown that inhomogeneous strains can\ninduce 'pseudomagnetic fields' that behave very similarly to real fields. Here,\nwe show experimentally and theoretically that, by properly structuring a\ndielectric lattice, it is possible to induce a pseudomagnetic field at optical\nfrequencies in a photonic lattice, where the propagation dynamics is equivalent\nto the evolution of an electronic wavepacket in graphene. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first realization of a pseudomagnetic field in optics. The induced\nfield gives rise to multiple photonic Landau levels (singularities in the\ndensity of states) separated by band gaps. We show experimentally and\nnumerically that the gaps between these Landau levels give rise to transverse\nconfinement of the optical modes. The use of strain allows for the exploration\nof magnetic effects in a non-resonant way that would be otherwise inaccessible\nin optics. Employing inhomogeneous strain to induce pseudomagnetism suggests\nthe possibility that aperiodic photonic crystal structures can achieve greater\nfield-enhancement and slow-light effects than periodic structures via the high\ndensity-of-states at Landau levels. Generalizing these concepts to other\nsystems beyond optics, for example with matter waves in optical potentials,\noffers new intriguing physics that is fundamentally different from that in\npurely periodic structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 08:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\nproblem is that holonomy corrections modify the gravitational part of the\nHamiltonian of the system leading, after Legendre's transformation, to a non\ncovariant Lagrangian which is in contradiction with one of the main principles\nof General Relativity. A more consistent way to deal with the big rip\nsingularity avoidance is to disregard modification in the gravitational part of\nthe Hamiltonian, and only consider inverse volume effects \\cite{bo02a}. In this\ncase we will see that, not like the big bang singularity, the big rip\nsingularity survives in loop quantum cosmology. Another way to deal with the\nbig rip avoidance is to take into account geometric quantum effects given by\nthe the Wheeler-De Witt equation. In that case, even though the wave packets\nspread, the expectation values satisfy the same equations as their classical\nanalogues. Then, following the viewpoint adopted in loop quantum cosmology, one\ncan conclude that the big rip singularity survives when one takes into account\nthese quantum effects. However, the spreading of the wave packets prevents the\nrecover of the semiclassical time, and thus, one might conclude that the\nclassical evolution of the universe come to and end before the big rip is\nreached. This is not conclusive because. as we will see, it always exists other\nexternal times that allows us to define the classical and quantum evolution of\nthe universe up to the big rip singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 10:20:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 08:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

In a seminal paper, Aingworth,\nChekuri, Indyk and Motwani [SIAM J.

In this paper we present an algorithm that produces the same estimate\nin $\\Ot(m\\sqrt n)$ expected running time. We then provide strong evidence that\na better approximation may be hard to obtain if we insist on an $O(m^{2-\\eps})$\nrunning time. In particular, we show that if there is some constant $\\eps>0$ so\nthat there is an algorithm for undirected unweighted graphs that runs in\n$O(m^{2-\\eps})$ time and produces an approximation $\\hat{D}$ such that $\n(2/3+\\eps) D \\leq \\hat{D} \\leq D$, then SAT for CNF formulas on $n$ variables\ncan be solved in $O^{*}((2-\\delta)^{n})$ time for some constant $\\delta>0$, and\nthe strong exponential time hypothesis of [Impagliazzo, Paturi, Zane JCSS'01]\nis false.\n  Motivated by this somewhat negative result, we study whether it is possible\nto obtain a better approximation for specific cases.

Our hypothesis is that an internal\nskeleton may have evolved from a bilaterally symmetric ancestor with an\nexternal skeleton. By growing the organism inside-out an external skeleton\nbecomes an internal skeleton. Our hypothesis is supported by a computational\ntheory of bilateral symmetry that allows us to model and simulate this process.\nInside-out development is achieved by an orientation switch. Given the\ndevelopment of two bilateral founder cells that generate a bilateral organism,\na mutation that reverses the internal mirror orientation of those bilateral\nfounder cells leads to inside-out development. The new orientation is\nepigenetically inherited by all progeny. A key insight is that each cell\ncontained in the newly evolved organism with the internal skeleton develops\naccording to the very same downstream developmental control network that\ndirects the development of its exoskeletal ancestor. The networks and their\ngenomes are are identical, but the interpretation is different because of the\ncell's inverted orientation.

The shapes of the filament profiles are linked to their physical\nstate. Before drawing conclusions on the observed column density profiles, we\nmust evaluate the observational uncertainties. We want to estimate the bias\nthat could result from radiative transfer effects or from variations of submm\ndust emissivity. We use cloud models obtained with magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations and carry out radiative transfer calculations to produce maps of\nsub-millimetre emission. Column densities are estimated based on the synthetic\nobservations. For selected filaments, the estimated profiles are compared to\nthose derived from the original column density. Possible effects from spatial\nvariations of dust properties are examined. With instrumental noise typical of\nthe Herschel observations, the parameters derived for nearby clouds are correct\nto within a few percent. The radiative transfer effects have only a minor\neffect on the results.

The errors increase in proportion to the cloud\ndistance. Assuming the resolution of Herschel instruments, the model filaments\nare barely resolved at a distance of ~400 pc and the errors in the parameters\nof the Plummer function are several tens of per cent.

One wall is solvophilic\nand would be completely wet at bulk liquid-gas coexistence while the other is\nsolvophobic and would be completely dry at bulk coexistence. When the wall\nseparation L is large and the system is below the bulk critical temperature and\nclose to bulk liquid-gas coexistence, a `delocalized interface' or `soft mode'\nphase forms with a liquid-gas interface near to the centre of the slit; this\ninteracts with the walls via the power-law tails of the interparticle\npotentials. We use a coarse-grained effective Hamiltonian approach to derive\nexplicit scaling expressions for the Gibbs adsorption, the surface tension, the\nsolvation force and the total susceptibility. Using a non-local density\nfunctional theory (DFT) we calculate density profiles for the asymmetrically\nconfined fluid at different chemical potentials and, for sufficiently large L,\nconfirm the scaling predictions for the four thermodynamic quantities. Since\nthe upper critical dimension for complete wetting with power-law potentials is\n<3 we argue that our (mean-field) scaling predictions should remain valid in\ntreatments that incorporate the effects of interfacial fluctuations. As the\nwall separation L is decreased at bulk liquid-gas coexistence we predict a\ncapillary evaporation transition from the `delocalized interface' phase to a\ndilute gas state with just a thin adsorbed film of liquid-like density next to\nthe solvophilic wall. This transition is connected closely to the first order\npre-wetting transition which occurs at the solvophilic wall in the\nsemi-infinite system. We compare the phase diagram for the competing walls\nsystem with the phase diagrams for the fluid confined between identical\nsolvophilic and identical solvophobic walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 12:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

H. Bennett, J. Comput. Phys., 22,\n245 (1976)]. Thus, if the DOS of one of the systems is known, one obtains those\nof the others and, hence, the partition functions. As a simple test case, the\nvapor pressure of an anharmonic Einstein crystal is computed, using the\nharmonic Einstein crystal as the reference system in one dimension; an\nauxiliary calculation is also performed in three dimensions. As a further\nexample of the algorithm, the energy dependence of the ratio of the DOS of the\nsquare-well and hard-sphere tetradecamers is determined, from which the\ntemperature dependence of the constant-volume heat capacity of the square-well\nsystem is calculated and compared with canonical Metropolis Monte Carlo\nestimates. For these cases and reference systems, the perturbation calculations\nexhibit a higher degree of convergence per Monte Carlo cycle than Wang-Landau\n(WL) sampling, although for the one-dimensional oscillator the WL sampling is\nultimately more efficient for long runs. Last, we calculate the vapor pressure\nof liquid gold using an empirical Sutton-Chen many-body potential and the ideal\ngas as the reference state. Although this proves the general applicability of\nthe method, by its inherent perturbation approach, the algorithm is suitable\nfor those particular cases where the properties of a related system are well\nknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 12:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 06:39:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 15:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 21 Oct 2012 07:39:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 20:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

Several options are\nimplemented to model the cosmic microwave background, Galactic diffuse emission\n(synchrotron, free-free, thermal and spinning dust, CO lines), Galactic H-II\nregions, extragalactic radio sources, dusty galaxies, and thermal and kinetic\nSunyaev-Zeldovich signals from clusters of galaxies. Each component is\nsimulated by means of educated interpolations/extrapolations of data sets\navailable at the time of the launch of the Planck mission, complemented by\nstate-of-the-art models of the emission. Distinctive features of the\nsimulations are: spatially varying spectral properties of synchrotron and dust;\ndifferent spectral parameters for each point source; modeling of the clustering\nproperties of extragalactic sources and of the power spectrum of fluctuations\nin the cosmic infrared background. The PSM enables the production of random\nrealizations of the sky emission, constrained to match observational data\nwithin their uncertainties, and is implemented in a software package that is\nregularly updated with incoming information from observations. The model is\nexpected to serve as a useful tool for optimizing planned microwave and\nsub-millimetre surveys and to test data processing and analysis pipelines. It\nis, in particular, used for the development and validation of data analysis\npipelines within the planck collaboration. A version of the software that can\nbe used for simulating the observations for a variety of experiments is made\navailable on a dedicated website.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 13:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We pay especial attention to the case of a finite chemical potential,\nwhich has not yet been fully explored. Our results, for the NJL model, are in\nqualitative agreement with other recent applications showing that, for stronger\nfields, the first order segment of the transition line increases with the\nmagnetic strength while the coexistence chemical potential value, at low\ntemperatures, decreases. In the present work, one of the most important results\nis related to the analysis of how these features affect the phase coexistence\nregion in the $T-\\rho_B$ plane. We find that the coexistence boundary\noscillates around the B=0 value for magnetic fields of the order $eB \\lesssim\n9.5\\, m_\\pi^2$ which can be understood by investigating the filling of Landau\nlevels at vanishing temperature. So far, most investigations have been\nconcerned with the effects of the magnetic field over the $T-\\mu$ plane only\nwhile other thermodynamical quantities such as the adiabats, the quark number\nsusceptibility, the interaction measure and the latent heat have been\nneglected. Here, we take a step towards filling this gap by investigating the\ninfluence of a magnetic field over these quantities. Finally, we argue that a\nnaive application of the MFA does not seem to be appropriate to treat the LSM\nin the presence of magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 15:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2012 11:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The generalization of some fundamental notions of the\ndifferential geometry and the theory of differential forms is presented. In\nparticular, the cohomology and integration theories for generalized higher\norder forms are developed, including the Cartan calculus, a generalization of\nde Rham cohomology and a version of Thom's isomorphism theorem. We consider in\ndetail a special type of generalized higher order tensors associated with\nbounded maximal $n$-acceleration and use it as a model of spacetime. A\ngeneralization of electrodynamic theory with higher order fields is introduced.\nWe show that combining the generalized higher order fields with maximal\nacceleration geometry the evolution of a point charged particle interacting\nwith the generalized higher order fields can be described by solutions of an\nimplicit second order ordinary differential equation. In flat space such\nequation is Lorentz invariant, does not have pre-accelerated solutions of\nDirac's type or run-away solutions, it is compatible with Newton's first law of\ndynamics and with the covariant Larmor's power radiation law. A generalization\nof the Maxwell-Lorentz theory is also introduced.

To get refocused images,\nautofocus proves to be useful post-processing technique applied to estimate and\ncompensate the unknown phase errors. However, a severe drawback of the\nconventional autofocus algorithms is that they are only capable of removing\none-dimensional azimuth phase errors (APE). As the resolution becomes finer,\nresidual range cell migration (RCM), which makes the defocus inherently\ntwo-dimensional, becomes a new challenge. In this paper, correction of APE and\nresidual RCM are presented in the framework of polar format algorithm (PFA).\nFirst, an insight into the underlying mathematical mechanism of polar\nreformatting is presented. Then based on this new formulation, the effect of\npolar reformatting on the uncompensated APE and residual RCM is investigated in\ndetail. By using the derived analytical relationship between APE and residual\nRCM, an efficient two-dimensional (2-D) autofocus method is proposed.\nExperimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 06:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}
