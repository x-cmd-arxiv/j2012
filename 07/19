We study the\nfollowing related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better\ndisentangling, can be exploited to produce faster-mixing Markov chains.\nConsequently, mixing would be more efficient at higher levels of\nrepresentation. To better understand why and how this is happening, we propose\na secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space\nthey occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at\nhigher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them\nexperimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing and\ninterpolating between samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 16:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}

Analogy with graphene suggests a possible avenue via a topographic\nroute by the formation of superlattice structures such as a moir\\'e patterns or\nripples, which can induce controlled potential variations. However, while the\ncharge and lattice degrees of freedom are intimately coupled in graphene, it is\nnot clear a priori how a physical buckling or ripples might influence the\nelectronic structure of topological insulators.

We\ndetect a difference of over a 30 per cent in the clustering strength for dark\nmatter haloes of 10^13-10^14 Msun, which is similar to the result of Bett et\nal. We explore whether the dependence of clustering strength on halo spin is\nremoved if we apply the redefinition of overdensity peak height proposed by\nLacerna & Padilla (Paper I) obtained using assembly ages. We find that this is\nnot the case due to two reasons. Firstly, only a few objects of low-virial mass\nare moved into the mass range where the spin introduces an assembly bias after\nusing this redefinition. Secondly, this formalism does not alter the mass of\nmassive objects. We then repeat the process of finding the redefined peak\nheight of Paper I but using the spin. In this case, the new masses show no\nspin-related assembly bias but they introduce a previously absent assembly bias\nwith respect to relative age. From this result, we conclude that the\nassembly-type bias with respect to the halo spin has a different origin than\nwith respect to assembly age. The former may be due to the material from\nfilaments, which is accreted by massive haloes, that is enhanced in\nhigh-density environments, thus causing more extreme spin values without\nsignificantly changing the formation age of the halo. In addition, high-mass\nobjects may correspond, in some cases, to a different peak height than that\nsuggested by their mass in numerical simulations, providing a possible\nexplanation for the assembly bias with respect to spin.

Being\ninherent to almost any wireless system, this resource allocation problem has\nreceived extensive attention. Yet, most common techniques either adopt\nclassical power control, in which mobile stations are received with the same\nSignal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio, or use centralized schemes, in which\nbase stations coordinate their allocations.\n  In this work, we suggest a novel scheduling approach in which each base\nstation, besides allocating the time and frequency according to given\nconstraints, also manages its uplink power budget such that the aggregate\ninterference, \"Noise Rise\", caused by its subscribers at the neighboring cells\nis bounded. Our suggested scheme is distributed, requiring neither coordination\nnor message exchange.\n  We rigorously define the allocation problem under noise rise constraints,\ngive the optimal solution and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to\nachieve it. We then discuss a relaxed problem, where the noise rise is\nconstrained separately for each sub-channel or resource unit. While\nsub-optimal, this view renders the scheduling and power allocation problems\nseparate, yielding an even simpler and more efficient solution, while the\nessence of the scheme is kept.

Owing to the perceptions about risks associated with\nvaccines and the `herd immunity' effect, it may provide suboptimal vaccination\ncoverage for the population as a whole. In this case, some subsidy policies may\nbe offered by the government to promote vaccination coverage. But, not all\nsubsidy policies are effective in controlling the transmission of infectious\ndiseases. We address the question of which subsidy policy is best, and how to\nappropriately distribute the limited subsidies to maximize vaccine coverage. To\nanswer these questions, we establish a model based on evolutionary game theory,\nwhere individuals try to maximize their personal payoffs when considering the\nvoluntary vaccination mechanism. Our model shows that voluntary vaccination\nalone is insufficient to control an epidemic. Hence, two subsidy policies are\nsystematically studied: (1) in the free subsidy policy the total amount of\nsubsidies is distributed to some individuals and all the donees may vaccinate\nat no cost, and (2) in the part-offset subsidy policy each vaccinated person is\noffset by a certain proportion of the vaccination cost. Simulations suggest\nthat, since the part-offset subsidy policy can encourage more individuals to be\nvaccinated, the performance of this policy is significantly better than that of\nthe free subsidy policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 05:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-20"}

We focus on how these processes influence the spin and shape\nof a large number of DM haloes covering a wide range of mass scales, from\ngalaxies to clusters at redshifts zero and one, extending to dwarf galaxies at\nredshift two. The haloes are extracted from the OverWhelmingly Large\nSimulations, a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological\nsimulations run with a range of feedback prescriptions. We find that the median\nspin parameter in DM-only simulations is independent of mass, redshift and\ncosmology. At z=0 baryons increase the spin of the DM in the central region\n(<=0.25 r_200) by up to 30 per cent when feedback is weak or absent. This\nincrease can be attributed to the transfer of angular momentum from baryons to\nthe DM, but is no longer present at z=2. We also present fits to the mass\ndependence of the DM halo shape at both low and high redshift. At z=0 the\nsphericity (triaxiality) is negatively (positively) correlated with halo mass\nand both results are independent of cosmology. Interestingly, these\nmass-dependent trends are markedly weaker at z=2. While the cooling of baryons\nacts to make the overall DM halo more spherical, stronger feedback\nprescriptions tend to reduce the impact of baryons by reducing the central halo\nmass concentration. More generally, we demonstrate a strongly positive\n(negative) correlation between halo sphericity (triaxiality) and galaxy\nformation efficiency, with the latter measured using the central halo baryon\nfraction. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effects of baryons on the\nDM halo spin and shape are minor when the effects of cooling are mitigated, as\nrequired by realistic models of galaxy formation, although they remain\nsignificant for the inner halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 05:46:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 13:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The problem of $k$-core decomposition is to calculate the\ncore number for every node in a graph. Previous studies mainly focus on\n$k$-core decomposition in a static graph. There exists a linear time algorithm\nfor $k$-core decomposition in a static graph. However, in many real-world\napplications such as online social networks and the Internet, the graph\ntypically evolves over time. Under such applications, a key issue is to\nmaintain the core number of nodes given the graph changes over time. A simple\nimplementation is to perform the linear time algorithm to recompute the core\nnumber for every node after the graph is updated. Such simple implementation is\nexpensive when the graph is very large. In this paper, we propose a new\nefficient algorithm to maintain the core number for every node in a dynamic\ngraph.

We devise an\nefficient algorithm to identify and recompute the core number of such nodes.\nThe complexity of our algorithm is independent of the graph size.

This occurs even for highly clean samples with only a trace\namount of charge disorder and shows that disorder effects can be important down\nto the nano scale. As a result, the previously predicted non-monotonic behavior\nfor the total force between dissimilar slabs as a function of their separation\ndistance is substantially modified by higher-order contributions, and in almost\nall cases of interest, we find that the equilibrium inter-surface separation is\nshifted to substantially larger values compared to predictions based solely on\nthe zero-frequency component. This suggests that the ensuing non-monotonic\ninteraction is more easily amenable to experimental detection. The presence of\ncharge disorder in the intervening dielectric medium between the two slabs is\nshown to lead to an additional force that can be repulsive or attractive\ndepending on the system parameters and can, for instance, wash out the\nnon-monotonic behavior of the total force when the intervening slab contains a\nsufficiently large amount of disorder charges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 07:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A method\nfor mitigating the impact of the privacy-inducing mechanism on the estimation\nperformance is described, which relies on controlling the Hinfinity norm of the\nfilter.

The examples of\nsuch a nonequilibrium condensation of unconserved particles are the\nBose-Einstein condensation of excitons, polaritons, and photons.

We also numerically investigate the momentum correlations in the\ncrossover between the quasicondensate and the ideal Bose-gas regimes using a\nclassical field approach and show how the anticorrelations gradually disappear\nin the ideal-gas limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 12:05:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2012 11:03:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 04:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-27"}

Indeed, when connectedness holds, a basic\nPareto local search, initialized with at least one non-dominated solution,\nallows to identify the efficient set exhaustively. However, this becomes\nquickly infeasible in practice as the number of efficient solutions typically\ngrows exponentially with the instance size. As a consequence, we generally have\nto deal with a limited-size approximation, where a good sample set has to be\nfound. In this paper, we propose the biobjective multiple and long path\nproblems to show experimentally that, on the first problems, even if the\nefficient set is connected, a local search may be outperformed by a simple\nevolutionary algorithm in the sampling of the efficient set. At the opposite,\non the second problems, a local search algorithm may successfully approximate a\ndisconnected efficient set. Then, we argue that connectedness is not the single\nproperty to study for the design of local search heuristics for MOCO.

Explosion models of\nsuper-Chandrasekhar-mass (super-Ch-mass) WDs are constructed, and multi-color\nlight curves (LCs) are calculated. The comparison between our calculations and\nthe observations of SN 2009dc suggests that the exploding WD has a super-Ch\nmass of 2.2-2.4 solar masses, producing 1.2-1.4 solar masses of Ni-56, if the\nextinction by its host galaxy is negligible. If the extinction is significant,\nthe exploding WD is as massive as \\sim2.8 solar masses, and \\sim1.8 solar\nmasses of Ni-56 is necessary to account for the observations. Whether the\nhost-galaxy extinction is significant or not, the progenitor WD must have a\nthick carbon-oxygen layer in the outermost zone (20-30% of the WD mass), which\nexplains the observed low expansion velocity of the ejecta and the presence of\ncarbon.

It is well known\nthat the structure which arises in the gaseous component of the disc due to a\ngravitational instability can have a significant effect on the evolution of\ndust particles. Previous results using global simulations indicate that spiral\ndensity waves are highly efficient at collecting dust particles, creating\nsignificant local over-densities which may be able to undergo gravitational\ncollapse. We expand on these findings, using a range of cooling times to mimic\nthe conditions at a large range of radii within the disc. Here we use the\nPencil Code to solve the 2D local shearing sheet equations for gas on a fixed\ngrid together with the equations of motion for solids coupled to the gas solely\nthrough aerodynamic drag force. We find that spiral density waves can create\nsignificant enhancements in the surface density of solids, equivalent to 1-10cm\nsized particles in a disc following the profiles of Clarke (2009) around a\nsolar mass star, causing it to reach concentrations several orders of magnitude\nlarger than the particles mean surface density. We also study the velocity\ndispersion of the particles, finding that the spiral structure can result in\nthe particle velocities becoming highly ordered, having a narrow velocity\ndispersion. This implies low relative velocities between particles, which in\nturn suggests that collisions are typically low energy, lessening the\nlikelihood of grain destruction. Both these findings suggest that the density\nwaves that arise due to gravitational instabilities in the early stages of star\nformation provide excellent sites for the formation of large,\nplanetesimal-sized objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 14:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This result means roughly, that the\nproblem of finding the smallest dominating set in a planar graph is easy when\nthe optimal solution is small. On the other hand, it is known that Planar\nDominating Set parameterized by k'=|V|-k (also known as Planar Nonblocker) has\na kernel of size 2k'. This means that Planar Dominating Set is easy when the\noptimal solution is very large. We improve the kernel for Planar Nonblocker to\n7/4k'. This also implies that Planar Dominating Set has no kernel of size at\nmost (7/3-epsilon)k, for any epsilon>0, unless P=NP. This improves the previous\nlower bound of (2-epsilon)k of Chen et al. Both of these results immediately\ngeneralize to H-minor free graphs (without changing the constants).

We propose that it may be the descendant\nof a Thorne-Zytkow Object (TZO). A TZO may at its formation have a rapidly\nspinning neutron star as a core, and a slowly rotating envelope. We found that\nthe core could be braked quickly to an extremely long spin period by the\ncoupling between its magnetic field and the envelope, and that the envelope\ncould be disrupted by some powerful bursts or exhausted via stellar wind. If\nthe envelope is disrupted after the core has spun down, the core will become an\nextremely long-period compact object, with a slow proper motion speed,\nsurrounded by a supernova-remnant-like shell. These features all agree with the\nobservations of 1E161348-5055. TZOs are expected to have produced extraordinary\nhigh abundances of lithium and rapid proton process elements that would remain\nin the remnants and could be used to test this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 14:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 08:41:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 09:30:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 14:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

As for all quantum\nsystems, a quantum realization of black holes requires an operator algebra of\nthe fundamental observables of the theory which is introduced in this study\nbased on aspects of loop quantum gravity. From the eigenvalue spectra of the\nquantum operators for the black hole area, charge and angular momentum, it is\ndemonstrated that a strict bound on the extensive parameters, different from\nthe relation arising in classical general relativity, holds, implying that the\nextremal black hole state can neither be measured nor can its existence be\nproven. This is, as turns out, a result of the specific form of the chosen\nangular momentum operator and the corresponding eigenvalue spectrum, or rather\nthe quantum measurement process of angular momentum. Quantum mechanical\nconsiderations and the lowest, non-zero eigenvalue of the loop quantum gravity\nblack hole mass spectrum indicate, on the one hand, a physical Planck scale\ncutoff of the Hawking temperature law and, on the other hand, give upper and\nlower bounds on the numerical value of the Immirzi parameter.

Besides using clear examples to illustrate the effect\nof the so-called monopole and mass sheet degeneracies, this article introduces\nthe most general form of said mass sheet degeneracy. While the well known\nversion of this degeneracy rescales a single source plane, this generalization\nallows any number of sources to be rescaled. Furthermore, it shows how it is\npossible to rescale each of those sources with a different scale factor. Apart\nfrom illustrating that the mass sheet degeneracy is not broken by the presence\nof multiple sources at different redshifts, it will become apparent that the\nnewly constructed mass distribution necessarily alters the existing mass\ndensity precisely at the locations of the images in the lens system, and that\nthis change in mass density is linked to the factors with which the sources\nwere rescaled. Combined with the fact that the monopole degeneracy introduces a\nlarge amount of uncertainty about the density in between the images, this means\nthat both degeneracies are in fact closely related to substructure in the mass\ndistribution. An example simulated lensing situation based on an elliptical\nversion of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile explicitly shows that such\ndegeneracies are not easily broken by observational constraints, even when\nmultiple sources are present. Instead, the fact that each lens inversion method\nmakes certain assumptions, implicit or explicit, about the smoothness of the\nmass distribution means that in practice the degeneracies are broken in an\nartificial manner rather than by observed properties of the lens system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 14:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Our\nsample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 and\nsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9Jy at 100 and 857GHz, over about\n31 to 40% of the sky. Using Planck HFI, all the sources have been classified as\neither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectral\nenergy distributions (SED). Our sample is thus complete, flux-limited and\ncolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. We find an\napproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and\n353GHz; at 353GHz or higher (or 217GHz and lower) frequencies, the number is\ndominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. For most of the sources,\nthe spectral indices are also derived. We provide for the first time counts of\nbright sources from 353 to 857GHz and the contributions from dusty and\nsynchrotron sources at all HFI frequencies in the key spectral range where\nthese spectra are crossing. The observed counts are in the Euclidean regime.\nThe number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier Planck,\nHerschel, BLAST, SCUBA, LABOCA, SPT, and ACT) and models taking into account\nboth radio or infrared galaxies. We derive the multi-frequency Euclidean level\nand compare it to WMAP, Spitzer and IRAS results. The submillimetre number\ncounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,\nwhereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recent\nmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. Finally we provide estimates of the\nlocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first such\nmeasurements at 545 and 857GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 15:29:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 17:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

For\nnetworks with feedback, two scheduling policies, referred to as random push\n(RP) and local-rarest-first (LRF), already exist. We propose a new scheduling\npolicy, referred to as minimum-distance-first (MDF), based on the expected\nnumber of innovative successful packet transmissions at each node of the\nnetwork prior to the \"next\" transmission time, given the feedback information\nfrom the downstream node(s) about the received packets. Unlike the existing\npolicies, the MDF policy incorporates loss and delay models of the link in the\nselection process of the chunk to be transmitted. Our simulations show that MDF\nsignificantly reduces the expected time required for all the chunks (or\nequivalently, all the message packets) to be decodable compared to the existing\nscheduling policies for line networks with feedback. The improvements are\nparticularly profound (up to about 46% for the tested cases) for smaller chunks\nand larger networks which are of more practical interest. The improvement in\nthe performance of the proposed scheduling policy comes at the cost of more\ncomputations, and a slight increase in the amount of feedback. We also propose\na low-complexity version of MDF with a rather small loss in the performance,\nreferred to as minimumcurrent-metric-first (MCMF). The MCMF policy is based on\nthe expected number of innovative packet transmissions prior to the \"current\"\ntransmission time, as opposed to the next transmission time, used in MDF. Our\nsimulations (over line networks) demonstrate that MCMF is always superior to RP\nand LRF policies, and the superiority becomes more pronounced for smaller\nchunks and larger networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 15:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-20"}

Concepts of a Machian/relational theory are proposed, where inertia and\nenergy are defined as mutual properties between pairs of objects. Due to\nBerkeley, only radial motion represents kinetic energy between (point) masses,\nwhich is the basis of anisotropic inertia, which in turn underlies the\nrelational principle. The Newtonian definition of potential energy is\nconsidered a model for Machian inertia, leading to a frame independent\ndefinition of Machian kinetic energy, which comprises of the Newtonian terms\n(relative to the \"fixed stars\") and small anisotropic Machian energy terms\nbetween objects. The latter account for relativistic trajectories, such as the\nanomalous perihelion precession and Lense-Thirring frame dragging. However,\nrelativistic effects of remote observation (e.g. time dilation) demand an\nisotropic model. A relational spacetime metric is derived, which provides an\nisotropic coordinate transform of the anisotropic Machian model, yielding a\nrelational model which matches GR expressions for relativistic trajectories and\neffects of remote observation. Therefore, the experimental verification of GR\nin these cases holds automatically for the relational model. The relational\nmodel fits the relational principle (including Mach's principle) and it is\nargued that it includes GR as a special case. The relational metric provides\nboth contraction and (unbound) expansion as a function of relative potential,\ni.e. without invoking dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 16:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-20"}
