We reduce the problem into a PT-symmetric dimer and\nillustrate that the latter has effectively two fundamental bifurcations, a\npitchfork (symmetry-breaking bifurcation) and a saddle-center one, which is the\nnonlinear analog of the PT-phase-transition. It is shown that the symmetry\nbreaking leads to ghost states (amounting to growth or decay); although these\nstates are not true solutions of the original continuum problem, the system's\ndynamics closely follows them, at least in its metastable evolution. Past the\nsecond bifurcation, there are no longer states of the original continuum\nsystem. Nevertheless, the solutions can be analytically continued to yield a\nnew pair of branches, which is also identified and dynamically examined. Our\nexplicit analytical results for the dimer are directly compared to the full\ncontinuum problem, yielding a good agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 18:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-05"}

The modification of static and dynamic properties of the system due to\nthe presence of a local transverse staggered field (LTSF) acting on the\none-dimensional spin array are argued to cause the unusual spin reorientation\ntransitions observed in BaCu2Si2O7.

In one-dimensional geometry, this type of\nequilibration requires either backscattering near the Fermi level or scattering\nwith small momentum transfer near the bottom of the electron spectrum.\nImportantly, pairwise forward scattering in the vicinity of the Fermi surface\nalone is not sufficient to produce a nonzero dc drag resistivity $\\rho_{\\rm\nD}$, in contrast to a number of works that have studied Coulomb drag due to\nthis mechanism of scattering before.

We demonstrate the emergence of a drag regime in which $\\rho_{\\rm D}$ does\nnot depend on the strength of interwire interactions, while depending strongly\non the strength of interactions inside the wires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 19:31:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 21:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

The double nucleus in our featured\nexperiment decomposes naturally into a thick eccentric disk of apo-apse aligned\nstars which is embedded in a lighter triaxial cluster. The eccentric disk\nreproduces key features of Keplerian disk models of Andromeda's double nucleus;\nthe triaxial cluster has a distinctive kinematic signature which is evident in\nHST observations of Andromeda's double nucleus, and has been difficult to\nreproduce with Keplerian disks alone. Our simulations demonstrate how the\ncombination of eccentric disk and triaxial cluster arises naturally when a star\ncluster accreted over a pre-existing and counter-rotating disk of stars, drives\ndisk and cluster into a mutually destabilizing dance.

This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter\nclustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy\nclustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on\nlarge-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We generalise the approach of Baldauf\net al. (2010) to remove small scale information (below 2 and 4 Mpc/h for\nlensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation\ncoefficient differs from unity. We derive constraints for three galaxy samples\ncovering 7131 sq. deg., containing 69150, 62150, and 35088 galaxies with mean\nredshifts of 0.11, 0.28, and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy\nbias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with\ntheoretical expectations. When we vary both \\sigma_8 and \\Omega_m (and\nmarginalise over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat LCDM model, the\nbest-constrained quantity is \\sigma_8 (\\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.57}=0.80 +/- 0.05\n(1-sigma, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors have\ncomparable contributions, and we fixed n_s=0.96 and h=0.7. These strong\nconstraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitive\nwith cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in some\nways less serious systematics. We therefore expect that this method will play a\nprominent role in future weak lensing surveys. When we combine these data with\nWMAP7 CMB data, constraints on \\sigma_8, \\Omega_m, H_0, w_{de} and \\sum m_{\\nu}\nbecome 30--80 per cent tighter than with CMB data alone, since our data break\nseveral parameter degeneracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 20:35:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 03:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Mar 2013 02:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In the\npresent paper, the solution is applied to calculate the Wien effect on\ndeviation from the Coulombic law of conduction in high fields. One of the\nimportant aims of the present line of work was in removing or avoiding the\ndivergence difficulty in calculating the electrophoretic and relaxation time\ncoefficients. The present work achieves that aim by calculating on the basis of\ncomputing the axial velocity profiles the position of the center of the ion\natmosphere as a function of the reduced field strength and therewith computing\nthe electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients for the migrating\nspherical ion atmosphere at each value of the reduced field strength. With the\nelectrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients thus calculated along the\ntrajectory of the center of the ion atmosphere with regard to the reduced field\nstrength, the equivalent ionic conductance of a magnesium sulfate solution is\ncalculated and compared with experimental data in very good accuracy. It is\nalso compared with the prediction by Wilson's theory and is found very much\nimproved over the latter. Moreover, the present method is divergence-free\nunlike Wilson's theory. It therefore not only sheds a new light on the\nnonequilibrium liquid structure of ionic solutions and the motion of ion\natmosphere in an electric field, but also shows how the Onsager--Wilson theory\nof conductance in electrolyte solutions should be applied to account for the\nWien effect on ionic conductance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 00:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}

We\nuse the XMM-Newton X-ray observations of NGC 3627 in the Leo Triplet galaxy\ngroup to explain peculiar features visible in the polarized radio maps. We\nanalyzed soft X-ray (0.2-1 keV) emission from NGC 3627 to study the\ndistribution of the hot gas and its temperature in different areas of the\ngalaxy. Any change throughout the disk can reflect distortions visible in the\nradio polarized emission.

Along with models of epidemics, they constitute a\nmajor theoretical framework of social spreading processes. In threshold models\non static networks, an individual changes her state if a certain fraction of\nher neighbors has done the same. When there are strong correlations in the\ntemporal aspects of contact patterns, it is useful to represent the system as a\ntemporal network. In such a system, not only contacts but also the time of the\ncontacts are represented explicitly. There is a consensus that bursty temporal\npatterns slow down disease spreading.

We compare this with the relation between the measured\ntransverse velocities, $v_{\\perp}$ and the field growth time-scales,\n$\\mu/\\dot{\\mu}$, inferred from the measured braking indices. We find that the\nobservational data is consistent with the theoretical prediction though the\nsmall number of data precludes a strong conclusion.

These models have been used extensively in\napplications to gene expression data, even in cases where there appears to be\nsignificant deviations from the Gaussian model. For more robust inferences, it\nis natural to consider extensions to t-distribution models. We argue that the\nclassical multivariate t-distribution, defined using a single latent Gamma\nrandom variable to rescale a Gaussian random vector, is of little use in highly\nmultivariate settings, and propose other, more flexible t-distributions. Using\nan independent Gamma-divisor for each component of the random vector defines\nwhat we term the alternative t-distribution. The associated model allows one to\nextract information from highly multivariate data even when most experiments\ncontain outliers for some of their measurements. However, the use of this\nalternative model comes at increased computational cost and imposes constraints\non the achievable correlation structures, raising the need for a compromise\nbetween the classical and alternative models. To this end we propose the use of\nDirichlet processes for adaptive clustering of the latent Gamma-scalars, each\nof which may then divide a group of latent Gaussian variables. Dirichlet\nprocesses are commonly used to cluster independent observations; here they are\nused instead to cluster the dependent components of a single observation. The\nresulting Dirichlet t-distribution interpolates naturally between the two\nextreme cases of the classical and alternative t-distributions and combines\nmore appealing modeling of the multivariate dependence structure with favorable\ncomputational properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 11:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}

Often, it can be assumed a\npriori that the underlying discrete-time random walk model is independent from\nabsolute position (homogeneity), direction (isotropy) and time (stationarity),\nas well as ergodic. In this article we first review some common statistical\nmethods for analyzing 2D trajectories, based on quantities with built-in\nrotational invariance. We then discuss an alternative approach in which the\ntwo-dimensional trajectories are reduced to one dimension by projection onto an\narbitrary axis and rotational averaging.

The statistical\nproperties of the signs and magnitudes are mathematically related to those of\nthe step lengths and turning angles of the original 2D trajectories,\ndemonstrating that no essential information is lost by this data reduction. The\nresulting binary sequence of signs lends itself for a pattern counting\nanalysis, revealing temporal properties of the random process that are not\neasily deduced from conventional measures such as the velocity autocorrelation\nfunction.

We conducted an extensive performance\nassessment on multiple sequence alignments simulated under a variety of\nsettings. We demonstrated high accuracy of the tool in parameter estimation and\nbranch lengths recovery, proving the method to be a valuable tool for\nphylogenetic inference in real life problems. $\\empar$ is an open-source C++\nimplementation of the methods introduced in this paper and is the first tool\ndesigned to handle nonhomogeneous data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 12:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}

Using PlaSim, an Earth-like\ngeneral circulation model, the solar constant S* is modulated between 1160 and\n1510 Wm-2 and the CO2 concentration, [CO2], from 90 to 2880 ppm. It is observed\nthat in such a parameter range the climate is bistable, i.e. there are two\ncoexisting attractors, one characterised by warm, moist climates (W) and one by\ncompletely frozen sea surface (Snowball Earth, SB). Linear relationships are\nfound for the two transition lines (W\\rightarrowSB and SB\\rightarrowW) in\n(S*,[CO2]) between S* and the logarithm of [CO2]. The dynamical and\nthermodynamical properties - energy fluxes, Lorenz energy cycle, Carnot\nefficiency, material entropy production - of the W and SB states are very\ndifferent: W states are dominated by the hydrological cycle and latent heat is\nprominent in the material entropy production; the SB states are predominantly\ndry climates where heat transport is realized through sensible heat fluxes and\nentropy mostly generated by dissipation of kinetic energy. We also show that\nthe Carnot efficiency regularly increases towards each transition between W and\nSB, with a large decrease in each transition. Finally, we propose well-defined\nempirical functions allowing for expressing the global non-equilibrium\nthermodynamical properties of the system in terms of either the mean surface\ntemperature or the mean planetary emission temperature. This paves the way for\nthe possibility of proposing efficient parametrisations of complex\nnon-equilibrium properties and of practically deducing fundamental properties\nof a planetary system from a relatively simple observable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 13:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The energy spectrum comprises a sequence of series of\nquasi-Rydberg levels relevant to the \"slow\" motion adjacent from the low\nenergies to the size-quantized levels associated with the \"fast\" motion. Only\nthe series attributed to the ground size-quantized sub-band is really discrete,\nwhile others corresponding to the excited sub-bands consist of quasi-discrete\n(Fano resonant) levels of non-zero energetic widths, caused by the coupling\nwith the states of the continuous spectrum branching from the low lying\nsub-bands. In the two- and three-subband approximation the spectrum of the\ncomplex energies of the impurity electron is derived in an explicit form.\nNarrowing the GNR leads to an increase of the binding energy and the resonant\nwidth both induced by the finite width of the ribbon. Displacing the impurity\ncentre from the mid-point of the GNR causes the binding energy to decrease\nwhile the resonant width of the first excited Rydberg series increases. As for\nthe second excited series their widths become narrower with the shift of the\nimpurity. A successful comparison of our analytical results with those obtained\nby other theoretical and experimental methods is presented. Estimates of the\nbinding energies and the resonant widths taken for the parameters of typical\nGNRs show that not only the strictly discrete but also the some resonant states\nare quite stable and could be studied experimentally in doped GNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 14:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

No deterministic algorithm\nthat outperforms the na\\\"{\\i}ve O(n) one was reported up to this date. The only\nprogress in this direction is due to Ivkovi\\'{c} and Lloyd \\cite{IL93}, who in\n1993 devised a deterministic algorithm with an \\emph{amortized} update time of\n$O((n+m)^{\\sqrt{2}/2})$, where $m$ is the number of edges.\n  In this paper we show the first deterministic fully dynamic algorithm that\noutperforms the trivial one. Specifically, we provide a deterministic\n\\emph{worst-case} update time of $O(\\sqrt{m})$. Moreover, our algorithm\nmaintains a matching which is in fact a 3/2-approximate maximum cardinality\nmatching (MCM). We remark that no fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining\n$(2-\\eps)$-approximate MCM improving upon the na\\\"{\\i}ve O(n) was known prior\nto this work, even allowing amortized time bounds and \\emph{randomization}.\n  For low arboricity graphs (e.g., planar graphs and graphs excluding fixed\nminors), we devise another simple deterministic algorithm with\n\\emph{sub-logarithmic update time}.

An open\nproblem in both algorithms has been how to choose an appropriate approximation\nstructure. We introduce 'structured region graphs', a formalism which marries\nthese two strategies, reveals a deep connection between them, and suggests how\nto choose good approximation structures. In this formalism, each region has an\ninternal structure which defines an exponential family, whose sufficient\nstatistics must be matched by the parent region. Reduction operators on these\nstructures allow conversion between EP and GBP free energies. Thus it is\nrevealed that all EP approximations on discrete variables are special cases of\nGBP, and conversely that some wellknown GBP approximations, such as overlapping\nsquares, are special cases of EP. Furthermore, region graphs derived from EP\nhave a number of good structural properties, including maxent-normality and\noverall counting number of one. The result is a convenient framework for\nproducing high-quality approximations with a user-adjustable level of\ncomplexity\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 16:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-09"}

In addition, in many applications, such inference\nis inherently uncertain. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for\nknowledge representation and reasoning enabling such event inference. Based on\nprobability theory, we define the representation of the associated uncertainty.\nIn addition, we formally define the probability space, and show how the\nrelevant probabilities can be calculated by dynamically constructing a Bayesian\nnetwork.

The BN-learning problem is NP-hard, so the\nstandard solution is heuristic search. Many approaches have been proposed for\nthis task, but only a very small number outperform the baseline of greedy\nhill-climbing with tabu lists; moreover, many of the proposed algorithms are\nquite complex and hard to implement. In this paper, we propose a very simple\nand easy-to-implement method for addressing this task. Our approach is based on\nthe well-known fact that the best network (of bounded in-degree) consistent\nwith a given node ordering can be found very efficiently. We therefore propose\na search not over the space of structures, but over the space of orderings,\nselecting for each ordering the best network consistent with it. This search\nspace is much smaller, makes more global search steps, has a lower branching\nfactor, and avoids costly acyclicity checks. We present results for this\nalgorithm on both synthetic and real data sets, evaluating both the score of\nthe network found and in the running time. We show that ordering-based search\noutperforms the standard baseline, and is competitive with recent algorithms\nthat are much harder to implement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 16:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-09"}

Using a modification\nof Canuto's (2002) ideas on turbulence and waves, these balances are merged\nwith an (internal) gravity-wave energy balance presented for the open ocean by\nGregg (1989), without mean-flow shear. The latter was augmented by a linear\n(viscous) friction term. Gregg's wave-energy source is interpreted on its\nlong-wave spectral end as internal tides, topography, large-scale wind, and\natmospheric low-pressure actions. In addition, internal eigen waves, generated\nby mean-flow shear, and the aging of the wave field from a virginal (linear)\ninto a saturated state are taken into account. Wave packets and turbulence are\ntreated as particles (vortices, packets) by ensemble kinetics so that the loss\nterms in all three balances have quadratic form. Following a proposal by Peters\n(2008), the mixing efficiency of purely wave-generated turbulence is treated as\na universal constant, as well as the turbulent Prandtl number under neutral\nconditions. It is shown that: (i) in the wind tunnel, eigen waves are switched\noff, (ii) due to remotely generated long waves or other non-local energy\nsources, coexistence equilibria of turbulence and waves are stable even at\nRichardson numbers as high as $10^3$; (iii) the three-equation system is\ncompatible with geophysically shielded settings like certain stratified\nlaboratory flows.
