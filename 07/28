The origin of\nNSCs is still unclear. Here we investigate the possibility that NSCs originate\nfrom the migration and merger of stellar clusters at the center of galaxies\nwhere a massive black hole (MBH) may sit. We show that the observed relation\nbetween NSC masses and the velocity dispersion of their host spheroids cannot\nbe reconciled with a purely in-situ formation scenario. On the other hand, the\nobserved relation appears to be in agreement with the predictions of the\ncluster merger model which also reproduces the observed relation between the\nsize of NSCs and their total luminosity. We evolve through dynamical friction a\npopulation of stellar clusters in a model of a galactic bulge taking into\naccount dynamical dissolution, starting from a power-law cluster initial mass\nfunction and a total mass in stellar clusters consistent with the cluster\nformation efficiency of the Milky Way (MW). The most massive clusters reach the\ncenter of the galaxy and merge to form a compact nucleus; after 10 Gyr, the\nresulting NSC has properties that are consistent with the observed distribution\nof stars in the MW NSC. When a MBH is included at the center of a galaxy,\nglobular clusters are tidally disrupted during inspiral, resulting in NSCs with\nlower densities than those of NSCs forming in galaxies with no MBHs. We suggest\nthis as a possible explanation for the lack of NSCs in galaxies containing MBHs\nmore massive than ~10^8M_Sun. Finally, we investigate the orbital evolution of\nglobular clusters in giant elliptical galaxies which are believed to always\nhost a MBH at their center rather than a NSC. In these systems an additional\nmechanism can prevent a NSC from forming: the time for globular clusters to\nreach the center of the galaxy is much longer than the Hubble time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 16:14:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 16:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

To utilize spectrum resources efficiently, an auction scheme is often\napplied where an operator serves as an auctioneer and accepts spectrum requests\nfrom SUs. Most existing works on spectrum auctions assume that the operator has\nperfect knowledge of PU activities. In practice, however, it is more likely\nthat the operator only has statistical information of the PU traffic when it is\ntrading a spectrum hole, and it is acquiring more accurate information in real\ntime. In this paper, we distinguish PU channels that are under the control of\nthe operator, where accurate channel states are revealed in real-time, and\nchannels that the operator acquires from PUs out of its control, where a\nsense-before-use paradigm has to be followed. Considering both spectrum\nuncertainty and sensing inaccuracy, we study the social welfare maximization\nproblem for serving SUs with various levels of delay tolerance. We first model\nthe problem as a finite horizon Markov decision process when the operator knows\nall spectrum requests in advance, and propose an optimal dynamic programming\nbased algorithm. We then investigate the case when spectrum requests are\nsubmitted online, and propose a greedy algorithm that is 1/2-competitive for\nhomogeneous channels and is comparable to the offline algorithm for more\ngeneral settings. We further show that the online algorithm together with a\npayment scheme achieves incentive compatibility for the SUs while guaranteeing\na non-negative revenue for the operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 17:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}

A\ncost-effective and practical solution is to offload cellular data through WiFi.\nRecent theoretical and experimental studies show that a scheme, referred to as\ndelayed WiFi offloading, can significantly save the cellular capacity by\ndelaying users' data and exploiting mobility and thus increasing chance of\nmeeting WiFi APs (Access Points). Despite a huge potential of WiFi offloading\nin alleviating mobile data explosion, its success largely depends on the\neconomic incentives provided to users and operators to deploy and use delayed\noffloading. In this paper, we study how much economic benefits can be generated\ndue to delayed WiFi offloading, by modeling a market based on a two-stage\nsequential game between a monopoly provider and users. We also provide\nextensive numerical results computed using a set of parameters from the real\ntraces and Cisco's projection of traffic statistics in year 2015.

Since the usual statistical models for radio signals in a\npropagation environment do not lend themselves easily to a description of the\navailable service rate on a wireless link, the performance analysis of wireless\nnetworks has resorted to higher-layer abstractions, e.g., using Markov chain\nmodels. In this work, we propose a network calculus that can incorporate common\nstatistical models of fading channels and obtain statistical bounds on delay\nand backlog across multiple nodes. We conduct the analysis in a transfer\ndomain, which we refer to as the `SNR domain', where the service process at a\nlink is characterized by the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the\nreceiver. We discover that, in the transfer domain, the network model is\ngoverned by a dioid algebra, which we refer to as (min,x)-algebra. Using this\nalgebra we derive the desired delay and backlog bounds.

SHARDS is an\nultra-deep optical spectro-photometric survey of the GOODS-N field (130\narcmin^2) at wavelengths 500 to 950 nm and using 24 contiguous medium-band\nfilters (spectral resolution R 50). The data reach 26.5 mag (>3-sigma level)\nwith sub-arcsec seeing in all bands. SHARDS main goal is obtaining accurate\nphysical properties of interm- and high-z galaxies using well-sampled optical\nSEDs with sufficient spectral resolution to measure absorption and emission\nfeatures. Among the different populations of high-z galaxies, SHARDS principal\ntargets are massive quiescent galaxies at z>1. In this paper, we outline the\nobservational strategy and include a detailed discussion of the special\nreduction and calibration procedures applied to the GTC/OSIRIS data. We present\nscience demonstration results about the detection and study of emission-line\ngalaxies (star-forming and AGN) at z=0-5. We also analyze the SEDs for a sample\nof 27 quiescent massive galaxies at 1.0<z<1.4. We discuss on the improvements\nintroduced by the SHARDS dataset in the analysis of their SFH and stellar\nproperties. We discuss the systematics arising from the use of different\nstellar population libraries.

A primary objective is to generalize the Manakov\nequations, well known in the case of single-mode fibers. We first investigate a\nreference case where linear coupling among the spatial modes of the fiber is\nweak and after averaging over birefringence fluctuations, we obtain new Manakov\nequations for multimode fibers. Such an averaging reduces the number of\nintermodal nonlinear terms drastically since all four-wave-mixing terms average\nout. Cross-phase modulation terms still affect multimode transmission but their\neffectiveness is reduced. We then verify the accuracy of our new Manakov\nequations by transmitting multiple PDM-QPSK signals over different modes of a\nmultimode fiber and comparing the numerical results with those obtained by\nsolving the full stochastic equation. The agreement is excellent in all cases\nstudied. A great benefit of the new equations is to reduce the computation time\nby a factor of 10 or more. Another important feature observed is that\nbirefringence fluctuations improve system performance by reducing the impact of\nfiber nonlinearities. Finally multimode fibers with strong random coupling\namong all spatial modes are considered. Linear coupling is modeled using the\nrandom matrix theory approach. We derive new Manakov equations for multimode\nfibers in that regime and show that such fibers can perform better than\nsingle-modes fiber for large number of propagating spatial modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 20:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Applying an existing routing protocol to a two-way relay\nnetwork can easily compromise the advantages of two-way relaying. Considering\nrouting path selection and two-way relaying together can be formulated as a\nnetwork optimization problem, but it is usually NP-hard. In this paper, we take\na different approach to study routing path selection for two-way relay\nnetworks.

Such analysis provides a framework of routing path selection by\nconsidering bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency and latency subject to\nphysical layer constraints such as the transmission rate, transmission power,\npath loss exponent, path length, and the number of relays.

While active\nregion loops are readily seen in images taken at EUV and X-ray wavelengths,\nquiet Sun loops are seldom identifiable and therefore difficult to study on an\nindividual basis. The first analysis of solar minimum (Carrington Rotation\n2077) quiet Sun (QS) coronal loops utilizing a novel technique called the\nMichigan Loop Diagnostic Technique (MLDT) is presented. This technique combines\nDifferential Emission Measure Tomography (DEMT) and a potential field source\nsurface (PFSS) model, and consists of tracing PFSS field lines through the\ntomographic grid on which the Local Differential Emission Measure (LDEM) is\ndetermined. As a result, the electron temperature Te and density Ne at each\npoint along each individual field line can be obtained. Using data from\nSTEREO/EUVI and SOHO/MDI, the MLDT identifies two types of QS loops in the\ncorona: so-called \"up\" loops in which the temperature increases with height,\nand so-called \"down\" loops in which the temperature decreases with height. Up\nloops are expected, however, down loops are a surprise, and furthermore, they\nare ubiquitous in the low-latitude corona. Up loops dominate the QS at higher\nlatitudes. The MLDT allows independent determination of the empirical pressure\nand density scale heights, and the differences between the two remain to be\nexplained. The down loops appear to be a newly discovered property of the solar\nminimum corona that may shed light on the physics of coronal heating. The\nresults are shown to be robust to the calibration uncertainties of the EUVI\ninstrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 22:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Moreover, these potential relays are better informed than the\nsource about their transmission costs, which depend on the exact channel\nconditions on their relay-destination links. This results in asymmetry of\navailable information between the source and the relays. In this paper, we use\ncontract theory to tackle the problem of relay selection under asymmetric\ninformation in OFDM-based cooperative wireless system that employs\ndecode-and-forward (DF) relaying.

Yet the pursuit of\nobjectives is ubiquitous in simulated evolution. A significant problem is that\nobjective approaches assume that intermediate stepping stones will increasingly\nresemble the final objective when in fact they often do not. The consequence is\nthat while solutions may exist, searching for such objectives may not discover\nthem. This paper highlights the importance of leveraging human insight during\nsearch as an alternative to articulating explicit objectives. In particular, a\nnew approach called novelty-assisted interactive evolutionary computation\n(NA-IEC) combines human intuition with novelty search for the first time to\nfacilitate the serendipitous discovery of agent behaviors. In this approach,\nthe human user directs evolution by selecting what is interesting from the\non-screen population of behaviors. However, unlike in typical IEC, the user can\nnow request that the next generation be filled with novel descendants. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that combining human insight with novelty\nsearch finds solutions significantly faster and at lower genomic complexities\nthan fully-automated processes, including pure novelty search, suggesting an\nimportant role for human users in the search for solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jul 2012 03:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-31"}

Here, a multi-antenna relay linearly precodes\nthe received (uplink) signals from multiple users before forwarding the signal\nin the downlink, where the purpose of precoding is to let each user receive its\ndesired signal with interference from other users suppressed. The problem of\noptimizing the precoder based on various design criteria is typically\nnon-convex and difficult to solve. The main contribution of this paper is a\nunified approach to solve the weighted sum mean square error (MSE) minimization\nand weighted sum rate maximization problems in MIMO switching. Specifically, an\niterative algorithm is proposed for jointly optimizing the relay's precoder and\nthe users' receive filters to minimize the weighted sum MSE. It is also shown\nthat the weighted sum rate maximization problem can be reformulated as an\niterated weighted sum MSE minimization problem and can therefore be solved\nsimilarly to the case of weighted sum MSE minimization.
