This technique has recently been applied in\nthe search for Dark Matter in objects such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies where\nthe presence of Dark Matter is inferred via stellar velocities. A precise\naccount of the density is needed to constrain the expected gamma ray flux from\nDM self-annihilation and to distinguish between cold and warm dark matter\nmodels. Unfortunately the traditional method of fitting the second order Jeans\nequation to the tracer dispersion suffers from an unbreakable degeneracy of\nsolutions due to the unknown velocity anisotropy of the projected system. To\ntackle this degeneracy one can appeal to higher moments of the Jeans equation.\nBy introducing an analog to the Binney anisotropy parameter at fourth order,\nbeta' we create a framework that encompasses all solutions to the fourth order\nJeans equations rather than those in the literature that impose unnecessary\ncorrelations between anisotropy of second and fourth order moments. The\ncondition beta' = f(beta) ensures that the degeneracy is lifted and we\ninterpret the separable augmented density system as the order-independent case\nbeta'= beta. For a generic choice of beta' we present the line of sight\nprojection of the fourth moment and how it could be incorporated into a joint\nlikelihood analysis of the dispersion and kurtosis. Having presented the\nmathematical framework, we then use it to develop a statistical method for the\npurpose of placing constraints on dark matter density parameters from discrete\nvelocity data. The method is tested on simulated dwarf spheroidal data sets\nleading to results which motivate study of real dwarf spheroidal data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 19:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 15:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 11:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

This \"double-decker\" configuration\nsustained for days before the upper branch erupted with a GOES-class M1.0 flare\non 2010 August 7. Analyzing this evolution, we obtain the following main\nresults. 1) During hours before the eruption, filament threads within the lower\nbranch were observed to intermittently brighten up, lift upward, and then merge\nwith the upper branch. The merging process contributed magnetic flux and\ncurrent to the upper branch, resulting in its quasi-static ascent. 2) This\ntransfer might serve as the key mechanism for the upper branch to lose\nequilibrium by reaching the limiting flux that can be stably held down by the\noverlying field or by reaching the threshold of the torus instability. 3) The\nerupting branch first straightened from a reverse S shape that followed the\npolarity inversion line and then writhed into a forward S shape. This shows a\ntransfer of left-handed helicity in a sequence of writhe-twist-writhe. The fact\nthat the initial writhe is converted into the twist of the flux rope excludes\nthe helical kink instability as the trigger process of the eruption, but\nsupports the occurrence of the instability in the main phase, which is indeed\nindicated by the very strong writhing motion. 4) A hard X-ray sigmoid, likely\nof coronal origin, formed in the gap between the two original filament branches\nin the impulsive phase of the associated flare. This supports a model of\ntransient sigmoids forming in the vertical flare current sheet. 5) Left-handed\nmagnetic helicity is inferred for both branches of the dextral filament. 6) Two\ntypes of force-free magnetic configurations are compatible with the data, a\ndouble flux rope equilibrium and a single flux rope situated above a loop\narcade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2012 04:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 00:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-16"}

The main targets for this\ninvestigation are SNRs expanding in high density environments. There are\nseveral indicators of radio thermal bremsstrahlung radiation from SNRs, such as\na flattening at higher frequencies and thermal absorption at lower frequencies\nintrinsic to an SNR. In this work we discuss the radio continuum properties of\n3 SNRs that are the best candidates for testing our hypothesis of significant\nthermal emission. In the case of SNRs IC443 and 3C391, thermal absorption has\nbeen previously detected. For IC443, the contribution of thermal emission at 1\nGHz, from our model fit is 3-57%. It is similar to the estimate obtained from\nthe thermal absorption properties (10-40% at 1 GHz). In the case of the 3C391\nthe conclusions are not so clear. The results from our model fit (thermal\nemission contribution of 10-25% at 1 GHz) and results obtained from the low\nfrequency absorption (thermal contribution of 0.15-7% at 1 GHz) do not overlap.\nFor the SNR 3C396 we suggest that if previously detected thermal absorption\ncould be intrinsic to the SNR then the thermal emission (<47% at 1 GHz from our\nmodel fit) could be significant enough to shape the radio continuum spectrum at\nhigh frequencies. Polarization observations for these SNRs can constrain the\nstrength of a thermal component. Reliable observations at low frequencies (<100\nMHz) are needed as well as more data at high radio frequencies (>1 GHz), in\norder to make stronger conclusions about the existence of \"radio thermally\nactive\" SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2012 08:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Attention is restricted to relatively\nweak ion temperature gradients (but permitting arbitrary electron temperature\ngradients), since in this limit a delta-f (small departures from a Maxwellian\ndistribution) rather than full-f approach is justified.

In the shadow of this\ndefinition, diversity receivers (such as selection combining, equal-gain\ncombining and maximal-ratio combining) and transmission techniques (such as\ncascaded fading channels, amplify-and-forward multihop transmission) are\ndeployed in mitigating various performance impairing effects such as fading and\nshadowing in digital radio communication links. However, the exact analysis of\nergodic capacity is in general not always possible for all of these forms of\ndiversity receivers and transmission techniques over generalized composite\nfading environments due to it's mathematical intractability. In the literature,\npublished papers concerning the exact analysis of ergodic capacity have been\ntherefore scarce (i.e., only [1] and [2]) when compared to those concerning the\nexact analysis of average symbol error probability. In addition, they are\nessentially targeting to the ergodic capacity of the maximal ratio combining\ndiversity receivers and are not readily applicable to the capacity analysis of\nthe other diversity combiners / transmission techniques. In this paper, we\npropose a novel moment generating function-based approach for the exact ergodic\ncapacity analysis of both diversity receivers and transmission techniques over\ngeneralized composite fading environments. As such, we demonstrate how to\nsimultaneously treat the ergodic capacity analysis of all forms of both\ndiversity receivers and multihop transmission techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2012 15:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-10"}

One important question is\nwhether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition\nof the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely\naffected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or\nprovide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which\ncan help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE\n1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to\nobserve the S I lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the\nS I line. A 3sigma$upper limit on the equivalent width (EW) of any line in our\nspectrum is EW<0.66 pm. Using either one-dimensional static or\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamical model-atmospheres, this translates into a\nrobust upper limit of [S/H]<-2.6. Conclusions: This upper limit does not\nprovide conclusive evidence for or against dust-gas winnowing, and the evidence\ncoming from other elements (e.g., Na and Ti) is also inconclusive or\ncontradictory. The formation of dust in the atmosphere versus an origin of the\nmetals in a metal-poor supernova with extensive \"fall-back\" are not mutually\nexclusive. It is possible that dust formation distorts the peculiar abundance\npattern created by a supernova with fall-back, thus the abundance ratios in HE\n1327-2326 may be used to constrain the properties of the supernova(e) that\nproduced its metals, but with some caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2012 15:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 07:31:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 16:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
