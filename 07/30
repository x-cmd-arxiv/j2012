We argue here that this observation results from the fact\nthat quantum criticality can allow the occurrence of very-strong-coupling\nsuperconductivity by preventing its suppression due to competing\nsymmetry-breaking instabilities. Treating the electrons through a large-U\nansatz yields their separation into boson quasiparticles which are directly\ninvolved in the formation of these instabilities, represented as their Bose\ncondensates, and charge-carrying fermion quasiparticles which are affected by\nthem indirectly. Within the critical regime, condensates corresponding to the\ndifferent broken-symmetry states are combined; consequently their negative\neffect on the pairing of the fermions is strongly diminished, enabling high-T_c\nsuperconductivity to occur. The observed phase diagram of the hole-doped\ncuprates then derives from a hidden T=0 quantum phase transition between a\nFermi-liquid and a non-Fermi-liquid broken-symmetry striped state.

In this paper, we report a phase diagram in the single-layer\nFeSe films grown on SrTiO3 substrate by an annealing procedure to tune the\ncharge carrier concentration over a wide range. A dramatic change of the band\nstructure and Fermi surface is observed, with two distinct phases identified\nthat are competing during the annealing process. Superconductivity with a\nrecord high transition temperature (Tc) at ~65 K is realized by optimizing the\nannealing process. The wide tunability of the system across different phases,\nand its high-Tc, make the single-layer FeSe film ideal not only to investigate\nthe superconductivity physics and mechanism, but also to study novel quantum\nphenomena and for potential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 02:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We start from the\nexact Schwinger equation of motion for the Greens function for projected\nelectrons, and develop a systematic expansion in a parameter \\lambda, relating\nto the double occupancy. The resulting Greens function has a canonical part\narising from an effective Hamiltonian of the auxiliary electrons, and a\ncaparison part, playing the role of a frequency dependent adaptive spectral\nweight. This adaptive weight balances the requirement at low \\omega, of the\ninvariance of the Fermi volume, and at high \\omega, of decaying as c_0/(i\n\\omega), with a correlation depleted c_0 <1. The effective Hamiltonian H_{eff}\ndescribing the auxiliary Fermions is given a natural interpretation with an\neffective interaction V_{eff} containing both the exchange J(ij), and the\nhopping parameters t(ij). It is made Hermitian by adding suitable terms that\nultimately vanish, in the symmetrized theory developed in this paper. Simple\nbut important shift invariances of the t-J model are noted with respect to\ntranslating its parameters uniformly. These play a crucial role in constraining\nthe form of V_{eff} and also provide checks for further approximations. The\nauxiliary and physical Greens function satisfy two sum rules, and the Lagrange\nmultipliers for these are identified. A complete set of expressions for the\nGreens functions to second order in \\lambda is given, satisfying various\ninvariances. A systematic iterative procedure for higher order approximations\nis detailed. A superconducting instability of the theory is noted at the\nsimplest level with a high transition temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 02:47:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 13:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2013 19:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 22:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-05"}

The latter is treated within the formalism of synchrotron radiation\nby replacing the particle Larmor radius with the curvature radius of the field\nlines. However, even at small pitch angles, the curvatures of the particle\ntrajectory and the field line may differ significantly. Moreover, as we show in\nthis paper the trajectory curvature varies with time, i.e. the process has a\nstochastic character. Therefore for calculations of observable characteristics\nof radiation by an ensemble of particles, the radiation intensities should be\naveraged over time. In this paper, for determination of particle trajectories\nwe use the Hamiltonian formalism, and show that that close to curved magnetic\nlines, for the given configuration of the magnetic field, the initial point and\nparticle energy, always exist a smooth trajectory without fast oscillations of\nthe curvature radius. This is the trajectory which is responsible for the\ncurvature radiation. The realization of this regime requires the initial\nparticle velocity to be directed strictly along the smooth trajectory. This\nresult might have direct relation to the recent spectral measurements of\ngamma-radiation of pulsars by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 11:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 11:33:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 13:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-23"}

In the course of this undertaking, revolutionizing new concepts in\nphysics were brought to light, such as (i) the \"physical significance of the\nphase\" of a quantum mechanical wave function whose role in force-transmitting\ngauge fields is to control the interaction between elementary particles in a\ncurrent conserving manner (ii) \"spontaneous symmetry breaking\" and its related\nto it collective Nambu-Goldstone modes, which encode the basic symmetry\nproperties of a quantum vacuum and the associated to them conserved quatities,\n(iii) The \"Anderson-Higgs mechanism\" and its associated to it, but so far\nexperimentally unconfirmed \"Higgs field\", which provides the introduction of\nmassive force transmitting gauge fields and ultimately the mass of elementary\nparticles.

Our analyses show that the R-M effect for\na binary planet or exomoon during its complete transit phase can be divided\ninto two parts. The first is the conventional one similar to the R-M effect\nfrom the transit of a single planet, of which the mass and the projected area\nare the combinations of the binary components; and the second is caused by the\norbital rotation of the binary components, which may add a sine- or linear-mode\ndeviation to the stellar radial velocity curve.

We find that the signatures caused by the orbital rotation of the\nbinary components are more likely to be revealed if the two components of\nbinary planet have different masses and mass densities, especially if the heavy\none has a high mass density and the light one has a low density.

Finally, a comparison of our observations with those of\nrecently published studies is represented and it is shown that there exists a\nqualitatively good agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 15:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We also provide revised\nmembership for all previously published APer low-mass stars and brown dwarfs\nrecovered in GCS based on the new photometry and astrometry provided by DR9. We\nfind no evidence of $K$-band variability in members of APer with dispersion\nless than 0.06-0.09 mag. We employed two independent but complementary methods\nto derive the cluster luminosity and mass functions: a probabilistic analysis\nand a more standard approach consisting of stricter astrometric and photometric\ncuts. We find that the resulting luminosity and mass functions obtained from\nboth methods are consistent. We find that the shape of the APer mass function\nis similar to that of the Pleiades although the characteristic mass may be\nhigher after including higher mass data from earlier studies (the dispersion is\ncomparable). We conclude that the mass functions of APer, the Pleiades, and\nPraesepe are best reproduced by a log-normal representation similar to the\nsystem field mass function although with some variation in the characteristic\nmass and dispersion values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 15:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In accordance with previous\nfindings it is shown that the performances of SPH to describe the development\nof Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities depend strongly on the consistency of the\ninitial condition set-up and on the leading error in the momentum equation due\nto incomplete kernel sampling. An error and stability analysis shows that the\nquartic B-spline kernel (M_5) possesses very good stability properties and we\npropose its use with a large neighbor number, between ~50 (2D) to ~ 100 (3D),\nto improve convergence in simulation results without being affected by the\nso-called clumping instability. SPH simulations of the blob test show that in\nthe regime of strong supersonic flows an appropriate limiting condition, which\ndepends on the Prandtl number, must be imposed on the artificial conductivity\nSPH coefficients in order to avoid an unphysical amount of heat diffusion.\nResults from hydrodynamic simulations that include self-gravity show profiles\nof hydrodynamic variables that are in much better agreement with those produced\nusing mesh-based codes. In particular, the final levels of core entropies in\ncosmological simulations of galaxy clusters are consistent with those found\nusing AMR codes. Finally, results of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability test\ndemonstrate that in the regime of very subsonic flows the code has still\nseveral difficulties in the treatment of hydrodynamic instabilities. These\nproblems being intrinsically due to the way in which in standard SPH gradients\nare calculated and not to the implementation of the artificial conductivity\nterm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 15:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
