However, no consensus\ncurrently exists as to which progenitor scenario is the correct one, or whether\nthe observed SN Ia rate is produced by a combination of both channels. Unlike a\nDD progenitor a SD progenitor is expected to emit supersoft X-rays for a\nprolonged period of time (~1 Myr) as a result of the burning of accreted matter\non the surface of the WD. An argument against the SD channel as a significant\nproducer of SNe type Ia has been the lack of observed supersoft X-ray sources\n(SSS) and the lower-than-expected integrated soft X-ray flux from elliptical\ngalaxies.\n  We wish to determine if it is possible to obscure the supersoft X-ray\nemission from a nuclear burning white dwarf in an accreting single degenerate\nbinary system. In case of obscured systems we wish to determine their general\nobservational characteristics.\n  We examine the emergent X-ray emission from a canonical SSS system surrounded\nby a spherically symmetric configuration of material, assuming a black body\nspectrum with T_BB=50 eV and L=10^38 erg/s. The circumbinary material is\nassumed to be of solar chemical abundances, and we leave the mechanism behind\nthe mass loss into the circumbinary region unspecified.\n  If steadily accreting, nuclear burning WDs are canonical SSS our analysis\nsuggests that they can be obscured by relatively modest circumbinary mass loss\nrates. This may explain the discrepancy of SSS compared to the SN Ia rate\ninferred from observations if the SD progenitor scenario contributes\nsignificantly to the SN Ia rate. Recycled emissions from obscured systems may\nbe visible in other wavebands than X-rays. It may also explain the lack of\nobserved SSS in symbiotic binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 16:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We develop a formalism to describe the\ncovariance matrices of power spectra and bispectra of all triangle\nconfigurations. In addition to the known contributions which extend up to\nsix-point correlation functions, we propose a new contribution `the halo sample\nvariance (HSV)' arising from the coupling of the lensing Fourier modes with\nlarge-scale mass fluctuations on scales comparable with the survey region via\nhalo bias theory.

By adding the\nbispectrum to the power spectrum, the total information content or the\ncumulative signal-to-noise ratio up to a certain maximum multipole of a few\n10^3 is improved by 20--50 per cent, which is equivalent to a factor of\n1.4--2.3 larger survey area for the power spectrum measurement alone.

In this\nwork, we present a new stochastic process, the Poisson Indel Process (PIP), in\nwhich the complexity of this computation is reduced to linear. The new model is\nclosely related to the TKF91 model, differing only in its treatment of\ninsertions, but the new model has a global characterization as a Poisson\nprocess on the phylogeny. Standard results for Poisson processes allow key\ncomputations to be decoupled, which yields the favorable computational profile\nof inference under the PIP model.

We concentrate on the\nclosed $gl(1|1)$ spin-chain and its continuum limit - the $c=-2$ symplectic\nfermions theory - and rely on two technical companion papers, \"Continuum limit\nand symmetries of the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain\" [Nucl.

Our main result is that the algebra of local\nHamiltonians, the Jones-Temperley-Lieb algebra JTL_N, goes over in the\ncontinuum limit to a bigger algebra than the product of the left and right\nVirasoro algebras. This algebra, S - which we call interchiral, mixes the left\nand right moving sectors, and is generated, in the symplectic fermions case, by\nthe additional field $S(z,\\bar{z})=S_{ab}\\psi^a(z)\\bar{\\psi}^b(\\bar{z})$, with\na symmetric form $S_{ab}$ and conformal weights (1,1). We discuss in details\nhow the Hilbert space of the LCFT decomposes onto representations of this\nalgebra, and how this decomposition is related with properties of the finite\nspin-chain. We show that there is a complete correspondence between algebraic\nproperties of finite periodic spin chains and the continuum limit.

The semi-simple part of JTL_N is represented by $Usp(N-2)$,\nproviding a beautiful example of a classical Howe duality, for which we have a\nnon semi-simple version in the full JTL image represented in the spin-chain.

Important aspects of the dynamics are understood, but many open\nquestions are pressing on. In this paper we address some of them using a\ntwistorial description, which brings new light on both classical and quantum\naspects of the theory. At the classical level, we clarify the covariant\nproperties of the discrete geometries involved, and the role of the simplicity\nconstraints in leading to SU(2) Ashtekar-Barbero variables. We identify areas\nand Lorentzian dihedral angles in twistor space, and show that they form a\ncanonical pair. The primary simplicity constraints are solved by simple\ntwistors, parametrized by SU(2) spinors and the dihedral angles. We construct\nan SU(2) holonomy and prove it to correspond to the (lattice version of the)\nAshtekar-Barbero connection. We argue that the role of secondary constraints is\nto provide a non trivial embedding of the cotangent bundle of SU(2) in the\nspace of simple twistors. At the quantum level, a Schroedinger representation\nleads to a spinorial version of simple projected spin networks, where the\nargument of the wave functions is a spinor instead of a group element. We\nrewrite the Liouville measure on the cotangent bundle of SL(2,C) as an integral\nin twistor space. Using these tools, we show that the\nEngle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine transition amplitudes can be derived from a path\nintegral in twistor space.

In particular, we aim to analyse how\nthe temporal dependence of the loop length (here modelling the expansion) will\naffect the P1 /P2 period ratio of transverse loop oscillations.\n  Due to the uncertainty of the loop's shape through its expansion, we discuss\nseparately the case of the loop that maintains its initial semi-circular shape\nand the case of the loop that from a semi-circular shape evolve into an\nelliptical shape loop. The equations that describe the oscillations in\nexpanding flux tube are complicated due to the spatial and temporal dependence\nof coefficients. Using the WKB approximation we find approximative values for\nperiods and their evolution, as well as the period ratio. For small values of\ntime (near the start of the expansion) we can employ a regular perturbation\nmethod to find approximative relations for eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies.\n  Using simple analytical and numerical methods we show that the period of\noscillations are affected by the rising of the coronal loop. The change in the\nperiod due to the increase in the loop's length is more pronounced for those\nloops that expand into a more structured (or cooler corona).

To explain the fine-tuning\nproblems such as gauge hiearchy problem and strong CP problem in the SM, we\npoint out that supersymmetry does not need to provide a dark matter candidate,\ni.e., R-parity can be violated. Thus, we consider three kinds of the NMSSM\nscenarios: in Scenarios I and II R-parity is conserved and the lightest\nneutralino relic density is respectively around and smaller than the observed\nvalue, while in Scenario III R-parity is violated. To fit all the experimental\ndata, we consider the \\chi^2 analyses, and find that the Higgs boson mass and\ndecay rates can be explained very well in these Scenarios. Considering the\nsmall \\chi^2 values and fine-tuning around 2-3.7% (or 1-2%), we obtain the\nviable parameter space with light (or relatively heavy) supersymmetric particle\nspectra only in Scenario III (or in Scenarios I and II). Because the singlino,\nHiggsinos, and light stop are relatively light in general, we can relax the LHC\nsupersymmetry search constraints but the XENON100 experiment gives a strong\nconstraint in Scenarios I and II.

The models make predictions about the age\ndistribution of the ICL stars, which may provide additional observational\nconstraints. However, these models also over-predict the fraction of stellar\nmass in the ICL by a substantial margin.

In this paper we analyze the spectra at\ndifferent locations within the ICL and find that it is dominated by old metal\nrich stars, at odds with what has been found in nearby clusters where the stars\nthat dominate the ICL are old and metal poor. While we see a weak evidence of a\nyoung, metal poor, component, if real, these young stars would amount to less\nthan 1% of the total ICL mass, much less than the up to 30% predicted by the\nmodels. We propose that the very metal rich (i.e. 2.5 times solar) stars in the\nICL of our cluster, which comprise approximately 40% of the total mass,\noriginate mostly from the central dumb-bell galaxy, while the remaining solar\nand metal poor stars come from spiral, post-starburst (E+A), and metal poor\ndwarf galaxies.

In this paper, we explore the possibility that radio-emitting\nelectrons are generated in hadronic cosmic ray (CR) proton interactions with\nambient thermal protons of the intra-cluster medium. Our CR model derives from\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation and additionally\naccounts for CR transport in the form of CR streaming and diffusion. This opens\nthe possibility of changing the radio halo luminosity by more than an order of\nmagnitude on a dynamical time scale. We build a mock galaxy cluster catalog\nfrom the large MultiDark N-body LCDM simulation by adopting a phenomenological\ngas density model for each cluster based on X-ray measurements that matches\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) and X-ray scaling relations and luminosity function.\nUsing magnetic field strength estimates from Faraday rotation measure studies,\nour model successfully reproduces the observed surface brightness profiles of\ngiant radio halos (Coma, A2163) as well as radio mini-halos (Perseus,\nOphiuchus), while obeying upper limits on the gamma-ray emission in these\nclusters. Our model is also able to simultaneously reproduce the observed\nbimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters at the same L_X as well as\nthe unimodal distribution of radio-halo luminosity versus the SZ flux Y;\nthereby suggesting a physical solution to this apparent contradiction.

We show that future observations of cosmogenic\nneutrinos will provide by far the most stringent limit on LIV in the neutrino\nsector. We derive the implied level of LIV required to suppress observation of\npredicted fluxes from several mainstream cosmogenic neutrino models, and\nspecifically those recently constrained by the ANITA and RICE experiments. We\nsimulate via detailed Monte Carlo code the propagation of cosmogenic neutrino\nfluxes in the presence of LIV-induced energy losses. We show that this process\nproduces several detectable effects in the resulting attenuated neutrino\nspectra, even at LIV-induced neutrino superluminality of (u_{\\nu}-c)/c ~\n10^{-26}, about 13 orders of magnitude below current bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 22:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 21:58:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 01:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Our approach,\nbased on experimental design, is to view data collection as a bi-level\noptimization problem where the inner problem is the ranking problem and the\nouter problem is to identify data which maximizes the informativeness of the\nranking.

It needs to determine how to optimally price\nthe excess spectrum so as to maximize its profit, knowing that this excess\ncapacity is stochastic in nature, does not come with exclusive access, and\ncannot provide deterministic service guarantees to a buyer. At the same time,\nbuyers are of different {\\em types}, characterized by different communication\nneeds, tolerance for the channel uncertainty, and so on, all of which a buyer's\nprivate information. The license holder must then try to design different\ncontracts catered to different types of buyers in order to maximize its profit.\nWe address this problem by adopting as a reference a traditional spectrum\nmarket where the buyer can purchase exclusive access with fixed/deterministic\nguarantees. We fully characterize the optimal solution in the cases where there\nis a single buyer type, and when multiple types of buyers share the same, known\nchannel condition as a result of the primary user activity. In the most general\ncase we construct an algorithm that generates a set of contracts in a\ncomputationally efficient manner, and show that this set is optimal when the\nbuyer types satisfy a monotonicity condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 04:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}

They are\ncharacterized by a sudden increase of DNA contour length and a decrease of the\nbending rigidity. It has been proposed that the first transition, at forces of\n60--80 pN, is a transition from B to S-DNA, viewed as a stretched duplex DNA,\nwhile the second one, at stronger forces, is a strand peeling resulting in\nsingle stranded DNAs (ssDNA), similar to thermal denaturation. But due to\nexperimental conditions these two transitions can overlap, for instance for\npoly(dA-dT). We derive analytical formula using a coupled discrete worm like\nchain-Ising model. Our model takes into account bending rigidity, discreteness\nof the chain, linear and non-linear (for ssDNA) bond stretching. In the limit\nof zero force, this model simplifies into a coupled model already developed by\nus for studying thermal DNA melting, establishing a connexion with previous\nfitting parameter values for denaturation profiles. We find that: (i) ssDNA is\nfitted, using an analytical formula, over a nanoNewton range with only three\nfree parameters, the contour length, the bending modulus and the monomer size;\n(ii) a surprisingly good fit on this force range is possible only by choosing a\nmonomer size of 0.2 nm, almost 4 times smaller than the ssDNA nucleobase\nlength; (iii) mesoscopic models are not able to fit B to ssDNA (or S to ss)\ntransitions; (iv) an analytical formula for fitting B to S transitions is\nderived in the strong force approximation and for long DNAs, which is in\nexcellent agreement with exact transfer matrix calculations; (v) this formula\nfits perfectly well poly(dG-dC) and $\\lambda$-DNA force-extension curves with\nconsistent parameter values; (vi) a coherent picture, where S to ssDNA\ntransitions are much more sensitive to base-pair sequence than the B to S one,\nemerges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 07:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-25"}

We combine two-dimensional hydrodynamical disk simulations of\ndisk-planet interactions with state-of-the-art coagulation/fragmentation models\nto simulate the evolution of dust in a disk which has a gap created by a\nmassive planet. We compute images at different wavelengths and illustrate our\nresults using the example of the transition disk LkCa15.\n  Results. The gap opened by a planet and the long-range interaction between\nthe planet and the outer disk create a single large pressure bump outside the\nplanetary orbit. Millimeter-sized particles form and accumulate at the pressure\nmaximum and naturally produce ring-shaped sub-millimeter emission that is\nlong-lived because radial drift no longer depletes the large grain population\nof the disk. For large planet masses around 9 $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$, the pressure\nmaximum and, therefore, the ring of millimeter particles is located at\ndistances that can be more than twice the star-planet separation, creating a\nlarge spatial separation between the gas inner edge of the outer disk and the\npeak millimeter emission. Smaller grains do get closer to the gap and we\npredict how the surface brightness varies at different wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 08:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-17"}

The\nfactorization consists of a geometric operator (path-ordered magnetic\ntranslation), a dynamical operator generated by the usual time-independent\nLandau Hamiltonian, and a nonadiabatic operator that determines the transition\nprobabilities among the Landau levels. Since the path-ordered magnetic\ntranslation and the nonadiabatic operators are, up to completely determined\nnumerical phase factors, just ordinary exponentials whose exponents are\nexplicitly expressible in terms of the canonical variables, all of the factors\nin the factorization are explicitly constructed. The numerical phase factors\nare quantum mechanical in nature and could be of significance in interference\nexperiments. The factorization is unique from the point of view of the quantum\nadiabatic theorem and provides a demonstration of how the quantum adiabatic\ntheorem (incorporating the Berry phase phenomenon) is realized when infinitely\ndegenerate energy levels are involved. Since the factorization separates the\neffect caused by the electric field into a geometric factor and a nonadiabatic\nfactor, it makes possible to calculate the nonadiabatic transition\nprobabilities near the adiabatic limit. A formula for matrix elements that\ndetermines the mixing of the Landau levels for a general, non-adiabatic\nevolution is also provided by the factorization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 09:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}

As in the method of\nStamatellos et al. (2007), the column density is estimated using pre-computed\nlocal quantities and is then used to estimate the radiative cooling rate. The\ncooling rate is a quantity of considerable importance, for example, in\nassessing the probability of disc fragmentation. Our method has three steps:\n(i) the column density from the particle to the mid plane is estimated using\nthe vertical component of the gravitational acceleration, (ii) the \"total\nsurface density\" from the mid plane to the surface of the disc is calculated,\n(iii) the column density from each particle to the surface is calculated from\nthe difference between (i) and (ii). This method is shown to greatly improve\nthe accuracy of column density estimates in disc geometry compared with the\nmethod of Stamatellos. On the other hand, although the accuracy of our method\nis still acceptable in the case of high density fragments formed within discs,\nwe find that the Stamatellos method performs better than our method in this\nregime. Thus, a hybrid method (where the method is switched in regions of large\nover-density) may be optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 11:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper, we characterize a population of cores which\nappear in the PACS bands and place them into context with their host cloud and\ninvestigate their evolutionary stage. We construct spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of 496 cores which appear in all PACS bands, 34% of which\nlack counterparts at 24 micron. From single-temperature modified blackbody fits\nof the SEDs, we derive the temperature, luminosity, and mass of each core.\nThese properties predominantly reflect the conditions in the cold, outer\nregions. Taking into account optical depth effects and performing simple\nradiative transfer models, we explore the origin of emission at PACS\nwavelengths. The core population has a median temperature of 20K and has masses\nand luminosities that span four to five orders of magnitude. Cores with a\ncounterpart at 24 micron are warmer and bluer on average than cores without a\n24 micron counterpart. We conclude that cores bright at 24 micron are on\naverage more advanced in their evolution, where a central protostar(s) have\nheated the outer bulk of the core, than 24 micron-dark cores. The 24 micron\nemission itself can arise in instances where our line of sight aligns with an\nexposed part of the warm inner core.

This connection between the\ns-rank exponent and the ordinary exponent enables us to significantly\ngeneralize the group-theoretic approach of Cohn and Umans, from group algebras\nto general algebras. Embedding matrix multiplication into general algebra\nmultiplication yields bounds on s-rank (not ordinary rank) and, prior to this\npaper, that had been a barrier to working with general algebras.\n  We identify adjacency algebras of coherent configurations as a promising\nfamily of algebras in the generalized framework.

In a suitable system of coordinates, this\nsystem has two degrees of freedom and the conserved energy is usually called\nthe Jacobi constant. In 1980, J. Llibre and C. Sim\\'o proved the existence of\noscillatory motions for the restricted planar circular three body problem, that\nis, of orbits which leave every bounded region but which return infinitely\noften to some fixed bounded region. To prove their existence they had to assume\nthe ratio between the masses of the two primaries to be exponentially small\nwith respect to the Jacobi constant. In the present work, we generalize their\nwork proving the existence of oscillatory motions for any value of the mass\nratio.\n  To obtain such motions, we show that, for any value of the mass ratio and for\nbig values of the Jacobi constant, there exist transversal intersections\nbetween the stable and unstable manifolds of infinity which guarantee the\nexistence of a symbolic dynamics that creates the oscillatory orbits. The main\nachievement is to rigorously prove the existence of these orbits without\nassuming the mass ratio small since then this transversality can not be checked\nby means of classical perturbation theory respect to the mass ratio. Since our\nmethod is valid for all values of mass ratio, we are able to detect a curve in\nthe parameter space, formed by the mass ratio and the Jacobi constant, where\ncubic homoclinic tangencies between the invariant manifolds of infinity appear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 12:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 14:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-08"}

However many\ntraditional machine learning methods fail to simultaneously integrate both\nvector space data and text. We present a supervised method using Laplacian\neigenmaps to augment existing machine-learning methods with low-dimensional\nrepresentations of textual predictors which preserve the local similarities.\nThe proposed implementation performs alternating optimization using gradient\ndescent. For the evaluation we applied our method to over 2,000 patient records\nfrom a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if patients\nwere diagnosed with cardiac disease. Our method was compared with latent\nsemantic indexing, latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant\nanalysis. The results were assessed using AUC, MCC, specificity, and\nsensitivity. Results indicate supervised Laplacian eigenmaps was the highest\nperforming method in our study, achieving 0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC\nrespectively. SLE showed an increase in 8.16% in AUC and 20.6% in MCC over the\nbaseline which excluded textual data and a 2.69% and 5.35% increase in AUC and\nMCC respectively over unsupervised Laplacian eigenmaps. This method allows many\nexisting machine learning predictors to effectively and efficiently utilize the\npotential of textual predictors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 08:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-31"}

They have well-defined deadlines, and relative priorities\nquantified by non-negative real weights. The objective is to find schedules\nwhich minimize the total weighted tardiness (TWT) of all jobs. We show how this\nproblem can be mapped into quadratic form and present a polynomial time\nheuristic solution based on the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) approach. It is\ndemonstrated, through the results of extensive numerical simulations, that this\nsolution outperforms other popular heuristic methods. The proposed heuristic is\nboth theoretically and empirically shown to be scalable to large problem sizes\n(over 100 jobs to be scheduled), which makes it applicable to grid computing\nscheduling, arising in fields such as computational biology, chemistry and\nfinance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 19:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}
