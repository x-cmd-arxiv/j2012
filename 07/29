Consistency between the metric tensor and the symplectic\nform forces us to introduce a K\\\"ahler geometry. The construction has notable\nfeatures. A complex structure is obtained in a natural way.

Traditionally, accurate channel estimation is done by\nsampling received signal by analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at Nyquist rate\n(high-speed ADC sampling) and then estimate all channel taps with\nhigh-resolution. However, traditional linear estimation methods have two mainly\ndisadvantages: 1) demand of the high-speed ADC sampling rate which already\nexceeds the capability of current ADC and also the high-speed ADC is very\nexpensive for regular wireless communications; 2) neglect the inherent channel\nsparsity and the low spectral efficiency wireless communication is unavoidable.\nTo solve these challenges, in this paper, we propose a high-resolution\ncompressive channel estimation method by using low-speed ADC sampling. Our\nproposed method can achieve close performance comparing with traditional sparse\nchannel estimation methods. At the same time, the proposed method has following\nadvantages: 1) reduce communication cost by utilizing cheap low-speed ADC; 2)\nimprove spectral efficiency by extracting potential training signal resource.\nNumerical simulations confirm our proposed method using low-speed ADC sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2012 03:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-31"}

However the increasing volume of data to be\nstored has motivated the introduction of erasure codes, a storage efficient\nalternative to replication, particularly suited for archival in data centers,\nwhere old datasets (rarely accessed) can be erasure encoded, while replicas are\nmaintained only for the latest data. Many recent works consider the design of\nnew storage-centric erasure codes for improved repairability. In contrast, this\npaper addresses the migration from replication to encoding: traditionally\nerasure coding is an atomic operation in that a single node with the whole\nobject encodes and uploads all the encoded pieces. Although large datasets can\nbe concurrently archived by distributing individual object encodings among\ndifferent nodes, the network and computing capacity of individual nodes\nconstrain the archival process due to such atomicity.\n  We propose a new pipelined coding strategy that distributes the network and\ncomputing load of single-object encodings among different nodes, which also\nspeeds up multiple object archival. We further present RapidRAID codes, an\nexplicit family of pipelined erasure codes which provides fast archival without\ncompromising either data reliability or storage overheads. Finally, we provide\na real implementation of RapidRAID codes and benchmark its performance using\nboth a cluster of 50 nodes and a set of Amazon EC2 instances. Experiments show\nthat RapidRAID codes reduce a single object's coding time by up to 90%, while\nwhen multiple objects are encoded concurrently, the reduction is up to 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2012 04:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 07:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-06"}

If the cold dark matter consists of\nweakly interacting massive particles, their annihilation within these\nsubstructures could lead to diffuse GeV emission that would dominate over the\nannihilation signal of the host halo. In this work we search for GeV emission\nfrom three nearby galaxy clusters: Coma, Virgo and Fornax. We first remove\nknown extragalactic and galactic diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds and point\nsources from the Fermi 2-year catalog and find a significant residual diffuse\nemission in all three clusters. We then investigate whether this emission is\ndue to (i) unresolved point sources; (ii) dark matter annihilation; or (iii)\ncosmic rays (CR). Using 45 months of Fermi-LAT data we detect several new point\nsources (not present in the Fermi 2-year point source catalogue) which\ncontaminate the signal previously analyzed by Han et al.(arxiv:1201.1003).\nIncluding these and accounting for the effects of undetected point sources, we\nfind no significant detection of extended emission from the three clusters\nstudied. Instead, we determine upper limits on emission due to dark matter\nannihilation and cosmic rays. For Fornax and Virgo the limits on CR emission\nare consistent with theoretical models, but for Coma the upper limit is a\nfactor of 2 below the theoretical expectation. Allowing for systematic\nuncertainties associated with the treatment of CR, the upper limits on the\ncross section for dark matter annihilation from our clusters are more stringent\nthan those from analyses of dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way. We rule out the\nthermal cross section for supersymmetric dark matter particles for masses as\nlarge as 100 GeV (depending on the annihilation channel).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2012 06:29:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 02:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-10"}

The proposed mechanism tackles a core problem of such\nsystems: how to induce coordination of DTN relays in order to achieve a target\nperformance figure, e.g., delivery probability or end-to-end delay, under a\ngiven constraint in term of network resources, e.g., number of active nodes or\nenergy consumption. Also, we account for the realistic case when the cost for\ntaking part in the forwarding process varies with the devices' technology or\nthe users' habits. Finally, the scheme is truly applicable to DTNs since it\nworks with no need for end-to-end connectivity.\n  In this context, we first introduce the basic coordination mechanism\nleveraging the notion of a Minority Game. In this game, relays compete to be in\nthe population minority and their utility is defined in combination with a\nrewarding mechanism. The rewards in turn configure as a control by which the\nnetwork operator controls the desired operating point for the DTN. To this aim,\nwe provide a full characterization of the equilibria of the game in the case of\nheterogeneous DTNs. Finally, a learning algorithm based on stochastic\napproximations provably drives the system to the equilibrium solution without\nrequiring perfect state information at relay nodes or at the source node and\nwithout using end-to-end communications to implement the rewarding scheme. We\nprovide extensive numerical results to validate the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2012 09:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 12:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 16:11:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 14:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-11"}

Therefore it is\nlikely that the gas physical conditions that prevail in forming clusters,\nlargely determine the properties of stars that form and in particular the\ninitial mass function. We develop an analytical model to account for the\nformation of low mass clusters and the formation of stars within clusters. The\nformation of clusters is determined by an accretion rate, the virial\nequilibrium and energy as well as thermal balance. For this latter both\nmolecular and dust cooling are considered using published rates. The star\ndistribution is computed within the cluster using the physical conditions\ninferred from this model and the Hennebelle & Chabrier theory. Our model\nreproduces well the mass-size relation of low mass clusters (up to few $\\simeq\n10^3$ M$_\\odot$ of stars corresponding to about 5 times more gas) and an\ninitial mass function which is $i)$ very close to the Chabrier's IMF, $ii)$\nweakly dependent on the mass of the clusters, $iii)$ relatively robust to (i.e.\nnot too steeply dependent on) variations of physical quantities as accretion\nrate, radiation and cosmic rays abundances. The weak dependence of the mass\ndistribution of stars with the cluster mass results from the compensation\nbetween varying clusters densities, velocity dispersions and temperatures all\ninferred from first physical principles. This constitutes a possible\nexplanation for the apparent universality of the IMF within the Galaxy though\nvariations with the local conditions could certainly be observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2012 13:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The proof relies on a key result asserting that every\ninfinite-dimensional Fr\\'echet space with a fundamental biorthogonal system\npossesses a nontrivial separable quotient. The later, is the byproduct of a\nmixture of known results on barrelledness and two fundamental results of Banach\nspace theory (namely, a result of Pe{\\l}czy\\'nski on Banach spaces containing\n$L_1(\\mu)$ and the $\\ell_1$-theorem of Rosenthal).
