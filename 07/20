The observed\noutbursts are connected to the strong variation in disc opacity as hydrogen\nionises near 5000 K. This physics leads to accretion disc models that exhibit\nbistability and thermal limit cycles, whereby the disc jumps between a family\nof cool and low accreting states and a family of hot and efficiently accreting\nstates. Previous models have parametrised the disc turbulence via an alpha (or\n`eddy') viscosity. In this paper we treat the turbulence more realistically via\na suite of numerical simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in\nlocal geometry. Radiative cooling is included via a simple but physically\nmotivated prescription. We show the existence of bistable equilibria and thus\nthe prospect of thermal limit cycles, and in so doing demonstrate that\nMRI-induced turbulence is compatible with the classical theory.

Here the situation is different: the outer Kuiper belt\ndoes have a definite future, although one of uncertain duration. Simulations\nprovide two distinct, compelling reasons. First, mean motion resonances in the\nouter belt [i.e., beyond the 1/2 resonance at 47.76 AU] are amazingly \"sticky\":\nin almost all cases bodies captured in them from regions closer to Neptune\nduring that planet's outward migration remain trapped for 4.6 byr. Most\ncaptured orbits are chaotic and so will eventually escape, but there is no\nreason to believe that all outer belt resonances will empty in the near future.\nSecond, in determining capture probabilities for various resonances, we find\nthat the first order 1/2 resonance is quite efficient, but, in clear contrast\nto higher order ones in the outer belt, nearly half of its victims have escaped\nduring 4.6 byr. These bodies typically remain in unstable orbits in the outer\nbelt, usually for several hundred million years before being expelled well\nbeyond 100 AU. Other inner belt resonances, although capturing less efficiently\nthan 1/2, behave in the same fashion. Thus the outer belt has a two component,\nlong-term population: one with members lying semi-permanently in one of about 6\nresonances and another that is far more temporary, but whose source provides a\ncontinuous and ready resupply. The resulting eccentricity distribution of this\ncombined population closely matches the observed one, as Hahn and Malhotra have\nmade clear but the inclination distribution is a better approximation to it\nthan is often claimed, a fact that probably should not be ignored when\nconsidering an origin for what has been labeled \"the scattered disk\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 19:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-20"}

We assume that the direct source-destination\nlink is not available and all links undergo fading. We propose two new\nbuffer-aided relaying schemes. In the first scheme, neither the source nor the\nrelay have CSIT, and consequently, both nodes are forced to transmit with fixed\nrates. In contrast, in the second scheme, the source does not have CSIT and\ntransmits with fixed rate but the relay has CSIT and adapts its transmission\nrate accordingly. In the absence of delay constraints, for both fixed rate and\nmixed rate transmission, we derive the throughput-optimal buffer-aided relaying\nprotocols which select either the source or the relay for transmission based on\nthe instantaneous SNRs of the source-relay and the relay-destination links. In\naddition, for the delay constrained case, we develop buffer-aided relaying\nprotocols that achieve a predefined average delay. Compared to conventional\nrelaying protocols, which select the transmitting node according to a\npredefined schedule independent of the link instantaneous SNRs, the proposed\nbuffer-aided protocols with adaptive link selection achieve large performance\ngains. In particular, for fixed rate transmission, we show that the proposed\nprotocol achieves a diversity gain of two as long as an average delay of more\nthan three time slots can be afforded. Furthermore, for mixed rate transmission\nwith an average delay of $E{T}$ time slots, a multiplexing gain of\n$r=1-1/(2E{T})$ is achieved. Hence, for mixed rate transmission, for\nsufficiently large average delays, buffer-aided half-duplex relaying with and\nwithout adaptive link selection does not suffer from a multiplexing gain loss\ncompared to full-duplex relaying.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 19:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 04:18:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Nov 2012 07:20:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 08:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-19"}

The galaxy pairs are selected to have velocity differences < 300\nkm/s, projected separations (rp) < 80 kpc/h, mass ratios between 0.1 and 10,\nand robust measurements of star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities. We\nmatch the galaxies in total stellar mass, redshift, and local density to a set\nof 10 control galaxies per pair galaxy. For each pair galaxy we can therefore\ncalculate the statistical change in star formation rate (SFR) and metallicity\nassociated with the interaction process. Relative to the control sample, we\nfind that galaxies in pairs show typical SFR enhancements that are, on average,\n60% higher than the control sample at rp < 30 kpc/h. In addition, the pairs\ndemonstrate more modest SFR enhancements of ~30% out to at least 80 kpc/h (the\nwidest separations in our sample). Galaxies in both major and minor mergers\nshow significant SFR enhancements at all rp, although the strongest starbursts\n(with SFR enhancements of a factor of ~10) appear to be found only in the major\nmergers. For the first time, we are also able to trace the metallicity changes\nin galaxy pairs as a function of projected separation. The metallicity is\ngenerally diluted in galaxy pairs by ~0.02 dex, with an average metallicity\ndecrement of -0.03 dex at the smallest separations. The SFR and metallicity\ntrends with projected separation are interpreted through a comparison with\ntheoretical models. These simulations indicate that the peak in SFR\nenhancements at small separations is due to systems near the end of the merger\nprocess. The extended plateau in SFR enhancements out to at least 80 kpc/h is\ndominated by galaxies that have made a pericentric passage and are now\nexperiencing triggered star formation on their trajectory towards\napogalacticon, or on a subsequent close approach.

We find that only a small fraction (3%-11% depending on current sheet\nsize) of the energy is stored close enough to the current sheet to be\ndissipated abruptly by the reconnection process. The remaining energy, stored\nin the larger-scale field, is converted to kinetic energy in a fast\nmagnetosonic disturbance propagating away from the reconnection site, carrying\nthe initial current and generating reconnection-associated flows (inflow and\noutflow). Some of this reflects from the lower boundary (the photosphere) and\nrefracts back to the X-point reconnection site. Most of this inward wave energy\nis reflected back again, and continues to bounce between X-point and\nphotosphere until it is gradually dissipated, over many transits. This phase of\nthe energy dissipation process is thus global and lasts far longer than the\ninitial purely local phase. In the process a significant fraction of the energy\n(25%-60%) remains as undissipated fast magnetosonic waves propagating away from\nthe reconnection site, primarily upward. This flare-generated wave is initiated\nby unbalanced Lorentz forces in the reconnection-disrupted current sheet,\nrather than by dissipation-generated pressure, as some previous models have\nassumed. Depending on the orientation of the initial current sheet the wave\nfront is either a rarefaction, with backward directed flow, or a compression,\nwith forward directed flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 21:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 17:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This thesis focuses on the requirements and design of a\nworkstation-based database system, which is motivated by an analysis of\nexisting database architectures that are typically run over static, specially\nprovisioned sets of machines. A typical clustered database system -- one that\nis run over a number of specially provisioned machines -- executes queries\ninteractively, returning a synchronous response to applications, with its data\nmade durable and resilient to the failure of machines.

We present a\nnew sampling algorithm, called Tiny Sample Extractor, with a new goal of a\nsample size smaller than 5% of the original graph while preserving two key\nproperties of a network, the degree distribution and its clustering\nco-efficient. Our approach is based on a new empirical method of estimating\nmeasurement biases in crawling algorithms and compensating for them\naccordingly. We present a detailed comparison of best known graph sampling\nalgorithms, focusing in particular on how the properties of the sample\nsubgraphs converge to those of the original graph as they grow. These results\nshow that our sampling algorithm extracts a smaller subgraph than other\nalgorithms while also achieving a closer convergence to the degree\ndistribution, measured by the degree exponent, of the original graph. The\nsubgraph generated by the Tiny Sample Extractor, however, is not necessarily\nrepresentative of the full graph with regard to other properties such as\nassortativity.

Galactic halos contain multiphase gas flows that are dominated in mass by\nthe ionized component and extend to large radii. The densest, coldest halo gas\nobserved in neutral hydrogen (HI) is generally closest to the disk (< 20 kpc),\nand absorption line results indicate warm and warm-hot diffuse halo gas is\npresent throughout a galaxy's halo. The hot halo gas detected is not a\nsignificant fraction of a galaxy's baryons. The disk-halo interface is where\nthe multiphase flows are integrated into the star forming disk, and there is\nevidence for both feedback and fueling at this interface from the temperature\nand kinematic gradient of the gas and HI structures. The origin and fate of\nhalo gas is considered in the context of cosmological and idealized local\nsimulations. Accretion along cosmic filaments occurs in both a hot (> 10^5.5 K)\nand cold mode in simulations, with the compressed material close to the disk\nthe coldest and densest, in agreement with observations. There is evidence in\nhalo gas observations for radiative and mechanical feedback mechanisms,\nincluding escaping photons from the disk, supernova-driven winds, and a\ngalactic fountain. Satellite accretion also leaves behind abundant halo gas.\nThis satellite gas interacts with the existing halo medium, and much of this\ngas will become part of the diffuse halo before it can reach the disk. The\naccretion rate from cold and warm halo gas is generally below a galaxy disk's\nstar formation rate, but gas at the disk-halo interface and stellar feedback\nmay be important additional fuel sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 01:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Observational results suggest huge surface magnetic field in certain\nneutron stars (NS) called magnetars.

We\nfurther study the hadron-quark phase transition in the interiors of NS giving\nrise to hybrid stars (HS) in presence of strong magnetic field. The hadronic\nmatter EOS is described based on relativistic mean field theory and we include\nthe effect of strong magnetic fields leading to Landau quantization of the\ncharged particles. For the quark phase we use the simple MIT bag model. We\nassume density dependent bag pressure and magnetic field. The magnetic field\nstrength increases going from the surface to the center of the star. We\nconstruct the intermediate mixed phase using Glendenning conjecture.

The spectra follow the evolution of the nova when the lines had\nstrong P Cygni profiles to a phase dominated by prominent emission lines. The\nnotable feature of the near-IR spectra in the early decline phase is the rare\npresence of first overtone bands of carbon monoxide in emission. Later about\n150 days after the peak brightness the IR spectra show clear dust formation in\nthe expanding ejecta. Dust formation in V496 Sct is consistent with the\npresence of lines of elements with low ionization potentials like Na and Mg in\nthe early spectra and the detection of CO bands in emission. The light curve\nshows a slow rise to the maximum and a slow decline indicating a prolonged mass\nloss. This is corroborated by the strengthening of P Cygni profiles during the\nfirst 30 days. In the spectra taken close to the optical maximum brightness,\nthe broad and single absorption component seen at the time of discovery is\nreplaced by two sharper components.

Our main result is that, unless NP is in coNP/poly,\nPathwidth admits no polynomial kernelization even when parameterized by the\nvertex deletion distance to a clique, by giving a cross-composition from\nCutwidth.

If protein synthesis is very bursty, the burstiness is the\ndominant noise source, independent of other details of the model. Finally, we\ndiscuss two sources of extrinsic noise: cell-to-cell variations in protein\ncontent due to cells being at different stages in the division cycles, which we\nshow to be small (for the protein concentration and, surprisingly, also for the\nprotein copy number per cell) and fluctuations in the growth rate, which can\nhave a significant impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 10:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-12"}

Similarly, most late-type\nspirals have an extended gas disk, observable in the 21cm radio line (HI). The\nmorphology of galaxies can be quantified well using a series of scale-invariant\nparameters; Concentration- Asymmetry-Smoothness (CAS), Gini, M20, and GM\nparameters. In this paper, we compare the quantified morphology and effective\nradius (R50) of the Westerbork observations of neutral Hydrogen in Irregular\nand Spiral galaxies Project (WHISP) HI maps to those of far-and\nnear-ultraviolet images obtained with galex, to explore how close the\nmorphology and scales of HI and UV in these disks correlate. We find that xuv\ndisks do not stand out by their effective radii in UV or HI. However, the\nconcentration index in FUV appears to select some xuv disks. And known xuv\ndisks can be identified via a criterion using Asymmetry and M20; 80% of xuv\ndisks are included but with 55% contamination. This translates into 61\ncandidate xuv disk out of our 266 galaxies, (23%) consistent with previous\nfindings. We consider three scenarios; tidal features from major mergers, the\ntypical extended Hi disk is a photo- dissociation product of the xuv regions\nand both Hi and UV features originate in cold flows fueling the main galaxy. We\ndefine extended HI and UV disks based on their concentration (CHI > 5 and CFUV\n> 4 respectively), but note that these two subsamples never overlap in the\nWHISP sample. This appears to discount a simple photo-dissociation origin of\nthe outer HI disk. Previously, we identified the morphology space occupied by\nongoing major mergers. Known xuv disks rarely reside in the merger dominated\npart of HI morphology space but those that do are Type 1. This suggests cold\nflows as the origin for the xuv complexes and their surrounding HI structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 11:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We adopt a gravitational potential that is generated by\nthree discs (gas and both thin and thick stellar discs), a bulge and a dark\nhalo, and fit the thin-disc component of the distribution function to the\nsolar-neighbourhood velocity distribution from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey. We\nfind that the disc's vertical density profile is in good agreement with data at\nz<~500 pc. The thick-disc component of the distribution function is then used\nto extend the fit to data from Gilmore & Reid (1983) for z<~2.5 kpc. The\nresulting model predicts excellent fits to the profile of the vertical velocity\ndispersion \\sigma_z(z) from the RAVE survey and to the distribution of v_\\phi\nvelocity components at |z|~1kpc from the SDSS survey. The ability of this model\nto predict successfully data that was not used in the fitting process suggests\nthat the adopted gravitational potential (which is close to a maximum-disc\npotential) is close to the true one. We show that if another plausible\npotential is used, the predicted values of \\sigma_z are too large. The models\nimply that in contrast to the thin disc, the thick disc has to be hotter\nvertically than radially, a prediction that it will be possible to test in the\nnear future. When the model parameters are adjusted in an unconstrained manner,\nthere is a tendency to produce models that predict unexpected radial variations\nin quantities such as scale height. This finding suggests that to constrain\nthese models adequately one needs data that extends significantly beyond the\nsolar cylinder. The models presented in this paper might prove useful to the\ninterpretation of data for external galaxies that has been taken with an\nintegral field unit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 11:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However, each utilizes a different Radio Technology\nand Modulation Scheme, which are characteristics of the standard.

Previous\nobservations expect an optically thick torus in the equatorial plane because of\na striking bipolar appearance and a large viewing angle of 30 - 40$\\degr$.\nHowever, models with such a torus as well as a bipolar lobe and an AGB shell\ncannot fit the SED and the images simultaneously.

This note briefly describes the main additional features\nand processes that have been added in the new release -- Vbfnlo Version 2.6.0.\nAt NLO QCD diboson production (W\\gamma, WZ, ZZ, Z\\gamma and \\gamma\\gamma),\nsame-sign W pair production via vector boson fusion and the process\nW\\gamma\\gamma j have been implemented (for which one-loop tensor integrals up\nto six-point functions are included). In addition, gluon induced diboson\nproduction can be studied separately at the leading order (one-loop) level. The\ndiboson processes WW, WZ and W\\gamma can be run with anomalous gauge boson\ncouplings, and anomalous couplings between a Higgs and a pair of gauge bosons\nis included in WW, ZZ, Z\\gamma and \\gamma\\gamma diboson production. The code\nhas also been extended to include anomalous gauge boson couplings for single\nvector boson production via VBF, and a spin-2 model has been implemented for\ndiboson pair production via vector boson fusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 15:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-23"}

Along the compact dimensions, periodicity conditions are imposed\nwith arbitrary phases. In addition, the presence of a constant gauge field is\nassumed. The nontrivial topology gives rise to an Aharonov-Bohm effect for the\nfermionic current induced by the gauge field.
