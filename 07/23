The procedure outlines\na set of rules for analytically constructing constraint equations that involve\nthe finite localized energy of cyclically generated defects. The idea of\nobtaining cyclically deformed defects concerns the possibility of regenerating\na primitive (departing) defect structure through successive, unidirectional,\nand eventually irreversible, deformation processes. Our technique is applied on\nkink-like and lump-like solutions in models described by a single real scalar\nfield, such that extensions to quantum mechanics follow the usual theory of\ndeformed defects. The preliminary results show that the cyclic device supports\nsimultaneously kink-like and lump-like defects into 3- and 4-cyclic deformation\nchains with topological mass values closed by trigonometric and hyperbolic\ndeformations. In a straightforward generalization, results concerning with the\nanalytical calculation of $N$-cyclic deformations are obtained and lessons\nregarding extensions from more elaborated primitive defects are depicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2012 16:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 21:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 18:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-09"}

Compared to a field\ngalaxy study with a similar limiting magnitude (van Dokkum 2005), our cluster\nstudy presents a similar post-merger fraction but a markedly lower on-going\nmerger fraction. The merger fraction derived is surprisingly high for the high\ndensity of our clusters, where the fast internal motions of galaxies are\nthought to play a negative role in galaxy mergers. The fraction of post-merger\nand on-going merger galaxies can be explained as follows. Most of the\npost-merger galaxies may have carried over their merger features from their\nprevious halo environment, whereas interacting galaxies interact in the current\ncluster in situ. According to our semi-analytic calculation, massive cluster\nhaloes may very well have experienced tens of halo mergers over the last 4-5\nGyr; post-merger features last that long, allowing these features to be\ndetected in our clusters today.

Most of previous works in this area mainly\nfocus on discussing the effects of spreading probability or immunization\nstrategy on static networks. However, in real systems, the peer-to-peer network\nstructure changes constantly according to frequently social activities of\nusers. In order to capture this dynamical property and study its impact on\ninformation spreading, in this paper, a link rewiring strategy based on the\nFermi function is introduced. In the present model, the informed individuals\ntend to break old links and reconnect to their second-order friends with more\nuninformed neighbors. Simulation results on the susceptible-infected-recovered\n(\\textit{SIR}) model with fixed recovery time $T=1$ indicate that the\ninformation would spread more faster and broader with the proposed rewiring\nstrategy. Extensive analyses of the information cascade size distribution show\nthat the spreading process of the initial steps plays a very important role,\nthat is to say, the information will spread out if it is still survival at the\nbeginning time.

The allosomes are now already been sequenced and\nfound there are about 2000 and 78 genes in human X and Y chromosomes\nrespectively. The hemizygosity of the human X chromosome in males exposes\nrecessive disease alleles, and this phenomenon has prompted decades of\nintensive study of X-linked disorders. By contrast, the small size of the human\nY chromosome, and its prominent long-arm heterochromatic region suggested\nabsence of function beyond sex determination. But the present problem is to\naccomplish whether a given sequence of nucleotides i.e. a DNA is a Human X or Y\nchromosomal genes or not, without any biological experimental support. In our\nperspective, a proper quantitative understanding of these genes is required to\njustify or nullify whether a given sequence is a Human X or Y chromosomal gene.\nIn this paper, some of the X and Y chromosomal genes have been quantified in\ngenomic and proteomic level through Fractal Geometric and Mathematical\nMorphometric analysis.

Using a generic form of\nthese rules we explore the collective behavior and emergent dynamics of a\nsimulated swarm. For a wide range of flock size and interaction extent (the\nfixed number of neighbors with which an individual will interact) we find that\nthe computational collective is inherently stable --- individuals are attracted\nto one another and will position themselves a preferred distance from their\nfixed neighbors within a rigid lattice. Nonetheless, the irregular overall\nshape of the flock, coupled with the need for individuals on the boundary to\nmove towards their neighbors creates a torque which leads the flock to rotate\nand then meander. We argue that this \"rolling meander\" is a very good proxy for\nreal collective behavior in animal species and yet arises from a simple\nhomogeneous and deterministic rule for interaction. Rather than then introduce\nleaders --- which has already been shown, quite straightforwardly, to drive\ncollective swarms such as this --- we introduce a small number of \"followers\".\nEach follower is bound to consider a random fixed individual to be among their\nneighbors, irrespective of actual metric distance between them. We find that\nthe introduction of a small number of such followers causes a phase transition\nthat quickly leads to instability in the flock structure (as no stable\nconfiguration arises) and the previously rigid crystalline interaction among\nneighbors now becomes fluid: the distance between neighbors decreases, the\nflock ceases to rotate and meanders less.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 04:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

Most prior work on PNC focused on its application in a\nsimple two-way-relay channel (TWRC) consisting of three nodes only. Studies of\nthe application of PNC in general networks are relatively few. This paper is an\nattempt to fill this gap. We put forth two ideas: 1) A general network can be\ndecomposed into small building blocks of PNC, referred to as the PNC atoms, for\nscheduling of PNC transmissions. 2) We identify nine PNC atoms, with TWRC being\none of them. Three major results are as follows. First, using the decomposition\nframework, the throughput performance of PNC is shown to be significantly\nbetter than those of the traditional multi-hop scheme and the conventional\nnetwork coding scheme. For example, under heavy traffic volume, PNC can achieve\n100% throughput gain relative to the traditional multi-hop scheme. Second, PNC\ndecomposition based on a variety of different PNC atoms can yield much better\nperformance than PNC decomposition based on the TWRC atom alone. Third, three\nout of the nine atoms are most important to good performance. Specifically, the\ndecomposition based on these three atoms is good enough most of the time, and\nit is not necessary to use the other six atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 05:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 09:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 11:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-23"}

We show that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) suppresses the\naxial-charge of a dressed-quark, g_A^q, at infrared momenta. Since this effect\ndisappears as chiral symmetry is restored, one may argue that g_A vanishes with\nthe restoration of chiral symmetry because no nucleon bound-state survives the\nassociated transition. The suppression of g_A^q is shown to be part of an\nexplanation for a 25% reduction of g_A from its nonrelativistic quark-model\nvalue. Critical too, however, is the presence of dressed-quark angular momentum\nwithin the nucleon. The value of g_A^q depends on the kernels of the gap and\nBethe-Salpeter equations. We find that incorporation of essentially\nnonperturbative effects associated with DCSB into these kernels inflates the\nvalue relative to that obtained at leading-order in a widely used truncation of\nQCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations.

The\nrelation of the velocity dispersion of the identified clump's internal motion\nwith the clump size is similar to that observed in the molecular clouds of our\nGalaxy. We find that the virial parameters for clumps in the bar region are\nlarger than that in the spiral arm region. From our numerical results, we\nestimate star formation in the bar and spiral arm regions by applying the\nsimple model of Krumholtz and McKee (2005). The mean relation between star\nformation rate and gas surface density agrees well with the observed\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation. The SFE in the bar region is $\\sim 60 %$ of the\nspiral arm region. This trend is consistent with observations of barred\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 08:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 01:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The GCCIC is an\ninterference channel with unilateral source cooperation that better models\npractical cognitive radio networks than the commonly used model which assumes\nthat one source has perfect non-causal knowledge of the other source's message.\nFirst the sum-capacity of the symmetric GCCIC is determined to within a\nconstant gap. Then, the insights gained from the derivation of the symmetric\nsum-capacity are extended to characterize the whole capacity region to within a\nconstant gap for more general cases. In particular, the capacity is determined\n(a) to within 2 bits for the fully connected GCCIC when, roughly speaking, the\ninterference is not weak at both receivers, (b) to within 2 bits for the\nZ-channel, i.e., when there is no interference from the primary user, and (c)\nto within 2 bits for the S-channel, i.e., when there is no interference from\nthe secondary user. The parameter regimes where the GCCIC is equivalent, in\nterms of generalized degrees-of-freedom, to the noncooperative interference\nchannel (i.e., unilateral causal cooperation is not useful), to the non-causal\ncognitive interference channel (i.e., causal cooperation attains the ultimate\nlimit of cognitive radio technology), and to bilateral source cooperation are\nidentified.

Until now,\nonly two molecules, OCS and SO2, have been detected in interstellar ices but\ncannot account for the elemental abundance of sulphur observed in diffuse\nmedium. Chemical models suggest that solid H2S is the main form of sulphur in\ndenser sources but observational constraints exist that infirm this hypothesis.\nWe have used the Nautilus gas-grain code in which new chemical reactions have\nbeen added, based on recent experiments of H2S ice irradiation with UV photons\nand high energy protons. In particular, we included the new species Sn, H2Sn\nand C2S. We found that at the low temperature observed in dense clouds, i.e. 10\nK, these new molecules are not efficiently produced and our modifications of\nthe network do not change the previous pre- dictions. At slightly higher\ntemperature, 20 K in less dense clouds or in the proximity of protostars, H2S\nabundance on the surfaces is strongly decreased in favor of the polysulfanes\nH2S3. Such a result can also be obtained if the diffusion barriers on the\ngrains are less im- portant. In the context of the life cycle of interstellar\nclouds and the mixing between diffuse and denser parts of the clouds, the\ndepletion of sulphur in the form of polysulfanes or other sulphur polymers, may\nhave occurred in regions where the temperature is slightly higher than the cold\ninner parts of the clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 08:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

It is proved that the equations\nof the slow passage through resonance in this system are identical to equations\nof the nonlinear Landau-Zener (LZ) tunneling. Three types of dynamical behavior\nare distinguished, namely, quasi-linear, moderately nonlinear and strongly\nnonlinear. The quasi-linear systems exhibit a gradual energy transfer from the\nexcited to the attached oscillator, while the moderately nonlinear systems are\ncharacterized by an abrupt transition from the energy localization on the\nexcited oscillator to the localization on the attached oscillator.

The cut-off\nwavenumber appears in single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation but\nit is absent in a multi-fluid approach. Up to now, an explanation for the\nexistence of the cut-off wavenumber is still missing. The aim of this paper is\nto point out the reason for the appearance of a cut-off wavenumber in\nsingle-fluid MHD. Beginning with three-fluid equations (with electrons, protons\nand neutral hydrogen atoms), we performed consecutive approximations until we\nobtained the usual single-fluid description is obtained. We solved the\ndispersion relation of linear Alfven waves at each step and sought the\napproximation responsible of the cut-off wavenumber appearance. We have found\nthat neglecting inertial terms significantly reduces the real part of the\nAlfven frequency although it never becomes zero. Therefore, the cut-off\nwavenumber does not exist at this stage. However, when the inertial terms\ntogether with the Hall term in the induction equation are neglected, the real\npart of the Alfven frequency becomes zero. The appearance of a cut-off\nwavenumber, when Alfven waves in partially ionized regions of the solar\natmosphere are studied, is the result of neglecting inertial and Hall terms,\ntherefore it has no physical origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 13:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In the typical conditions of the\nsolar-wind environment, and in situations of decaying turbulence, the numerical\nresults show that the velocity distribution functions of both ion species\ndepart from the typical configuration of thermal equilibrium. These\nnon-Maxwellian features are quantified through the statistical analysis of the\ntemperature anisotropy, for both protons and alpha particles, in the reference\nframe given by the local magnetic field. Anisotropy is found to be higher in\nregions of high magnetic stress. Both ion species manifest a preferentially\nperpendicular heating, although the anisotropy is more pronounced for the alpha\nparticles, according with solar wind observations. Anisotropy of the alpha\nparticle, moreover, is correlated to the proton anisotropy, and also depends on\nthe local differential flow between the two species.

We use\nmean-field magnetohydrodynamics in a parameter regime in which the properties\nof the negative effective magnetic pressure instability have previously been\nfound to be in agreement with those of direct numerical simulations. We find\nthat the instability is suppressed already for relatively slow rotation with\nCoriolis numbers (i.e. inverse Rossby numbers) around 0.2. The suppression is\nstrongest at the equator. In the nonlinear regime, we find traveling wave\nsolutions with propagation in the prograde direction at the equator with\nadditional poleward migration away from the equator. The prograde rotation of\nthe magnetic pattern near the equator is argued to be a possible explanation\nfor the faster rotation speed of magnetic tracers found on the Sun. In the bulk\nof the domain, kinetic and current helicities are negative in the northern\nhemisphere and positive in the southern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 13:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 10:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

However, determining\ntheir cooling ages requires the knowledge of their effective temperatures,\nmasses, radii, and atmospheric composition. So far, these parameters could only\nbe inferred for a small number of ultracool white dwarfs for which an accurate\ndistance is known, by fitting their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in\nconjunction with a theoretical mass-radius relation. However, the mass-radius\nrelation remains largely untested, and the derived cooling ages are hence\nmodel-dependent. Here we report direct measurements of the mass and radius of\nan ultracool white dwarf in the double-lined eclipsing binary SDSS\nJ013851.54-001621.6. We find M(WD)=0.529+/-0.010Msol and\nR(WD)=0.0131+/-0.0003Rsol. Our measurements are consistent with the mass-radius\nrelation and we determine a robust cooling age of 9.5 billion years for the\n3570K white dwarf. We find that the mass and radius of the low mass companion\nstar, M(sec)=0.132+/-0.003Msol and R(sec)=0.165+/-0.001Rsol, are in agreement\nwith evolutionary models. We also find evidence that this >9.5 Gyr old M5 star\nis still active, far beyond the activity lifetime for a star of its spectral\ntype. This is likely caused by the high tidally-enforced rotation rate of the\nstar. The companion star is close to filling its Roche lobe and the system will\nevolve into a cataclysmic variable in only 70 Myr. Our direct measurements\ndemonstrate that this system can be used to calibrate ultracool white dwarf\natmospheric models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 13:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 15:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

To try to break this relation alternative new technologies have been\nproposed, such as the use of the Integrated Photonic Spectrograph (IPS). Due to\ntheir diffraction limited nature the IPS is claimed to defeat the harsh scaling\nlaw applying to conventional instruments. The problem with astronomical\napplications is that unlike conventional photonics, they are not usually fed by\ndiffraction limited sources.

Each peer has the ability to change the network in a\nlimited way, e.g., by creating or deleting incident links. In doing so, a peer\ncan reduce its individual communication cost. Typically, these costs are\nmodeled by the maximum or average distance in the network. We introduce a\ngeneralized version of the basic network creation game (BNCG). In the BNCG (by\nAlon et al., SPAA 2010), each peer may replace one of its incident links by a\nlink to an arbitrary peer. This is done in a selfish way in order to minimize\neither the maximum or average distance to all other peers. That is, each peer\nworks towards a network structure that allows himself to communicate\nefficiently with all other peers. However, participants of large networks are\nseldom interested in all peers. Rather, they want to communicate efficiently\nonly with a small subset of peers. Our model incorporates these (communication)\ninterests explicitly. In the MAX-version, each node tries to minimize its\nmaximum distance to nodes it is interested in.\n  Given peers with interests and a communication network forming a tree, we\nprove several results on the structure and quality of equilibria in our model.\nFor the MAX-version, we give an upper worst case bound of O(\\sqrt{n}) for the\nprivate costs in an equilibrium of n peers. Moreover, we give an equilibrium\nfor a circular interest graph where a node has private cost \\Omega(\\sqrt{n}),\nshowing that our bound is tight. This example can be extended such that we get\na tight bound of \\Theta(\\sqrt{n}) for the price of anarchy. For the case of\ngeneral communication networks we show the price of anarchy to be \\Theta(n).\nAdditionally, we prove an interesting connection between a maximum independent\nset in the interest graph and the private costs of the peers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 15:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

By Increasing network capacity and reducing the\nrouting overhead through clustering brings more efficiency and effectiveness to\nscalability in relation to node numbers and the necessity for high mobility.\nThe manager node in clustering has responsibility for many functions such as\ncluster maintenance, routing table updates, and the discovery of new routes\nwithin the network. The other node named as gateway node communicate to the\nother cluster. In this paper we remove the cluster head (CH) and given a new\napproach in which cluster head and gateway will be same and that node is known\nas cluster head gateway (CHG), in which all the responsibilities of cluster\nhead and gateway will be perform by the Cluster head gateway(CHG) itself. By\napplying this approach we reduce of overheads and improve the over all\nperformance of the network while throughput will be same in both condition with\nthe help of Exata simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 12:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-03"}
