We derive these flow equations both in the limit\nof exact Wigner SU(4) symmetry and in the realistic case of broken symmetry. In\nthe symmetric limit we find that the renormalisation flow equations decouple,\nand can be combined into two sets, one of which matches the known results for\nbosons, and the other result matches the one for fermions with spin degrees\nonly. The equations show universal features in the unitary limit, which is\nobtained when the two-body scattering length tends to infinity.

A variety of services of 2G systems has\nincreased significantly and this will continue to grow even further in the\nemerging third-generation (3G) systems. Universal Mobile Telecommunication\nSystem (UMTS) is a third-generation mobile communications system which uses the\nWide-Band Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technique to support a wide\nvariety of services, like speech, video telephony, Internet browsing, etc.\nThese services require a wide range of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.\nQoS is an important issue as the number of multimedia services increases day by\nday. Differentiated QoS methods allow the differentiation of users based on\ntheir priority levels and channel conditions so that the network can allocate\nthe bandwidth for a particular request based on the QoS requirements. These\nrequirements are controlled by Radio Resource Management (RRM) mechanisms. In\nthis paper we have proposed two RRM algorithms which are modification to the\nexisting scheduling algorithms. One is Prioritized C/I scheduling, which takes\nthe priorities into consideration, and this algorithm serves the user with\nhighest priority. Other algorithm is Modified Inverse C/I scheduling, which\ntakes channel conditions into consideration and serves the users in degraded\nconditions, thereby improving QoS. The performance evaluation of two algorithms\nis done with EURANE extensions for NS-2. Simulation results shows the\nimprovement in QoS for the users who are at equidistance from Base Station (BS)\nbut requesting for different services by implementing Prioritized C/I\nscheduling and also for the users who are in degraded conditions by\nimplementing Modified Inverse C/I scheduling when compared to Max C/I and\nInverse C/I scheduling algorithm respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 16:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-25"}

We interpret short lived local\ndensity peaks, that appear and fade on approximately an orbital period, as\narising from positive interference between spiral density wave patterns. Stars\nnear such a peak can migrate over a significant distance in galactocentric\nradius during the peak lifetime, providing that the peak is sufficiently dense.\nUsing a Gaussian bar model for the potential perturbation associated with a\nnarrow transient spiral feature, estimates of the migration rate, angular\noffset between particle and spiral feature, and maximum eccentricity for\nmigrators roughly agrees with the values measured in our simulation. When\nmultiple spiral density waves are present, local density peaks can appear and\ndisappear on timescales faster than the timescale estimated for growth and\ndecay of individual waves and the peak surface density can be larger than for\nany individual wave.

In\nthis paper, we conclude that it does not match some basic expectations for a\ncore-collapse event. We discuss SN2011ht's spectral evolution from a hot dense\nwind to a cool dense wind, followed by the post-plateau appearance of a faster\nlow density wind during a rapid decline in luminosity. We identify a slow dense\nwind expanding at only 500--600 km/s, present throughout the eruption. A faster\nwind speed V ~ 900 km/s may be identified with a second phase of the outburst.\nThere is no direct or significant evidence for any flow speed above 1000 km/s;\nthe broad asymmetric wings of Balmer emission lines in the hot wind phase were\ndue to Thomson scattering, not bulk motion. We estimate a mass loss rate of\norder 0.04 Msun/yr during the hot dense wind phase of the event. There is no\nevidence that the kinetic energy substantially exceeded the luminous energy,\nroughly 2 X 10^49 ergs; so the total energy was far less than a true SN. We\nsuggest that SN2011ht was a giant eruption driven by super-Eddington radiation\npressure, perhaps beginning about 6 months before the discovery. A strongly\nnon-spherical SN might also account for the data, at the cost of more free\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 17:49:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 14:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Such R-parity violation is very constrained, however,\nby resulting B and L violating signals, requiring couplings so small that LSPs\nwill decay outside the detector in all but a few scenarios.

The magnetic\nsusceptibility crosses over from following a Curie-Weiss law at high\ntemperatures to a low temperature Curie law whose slope clearly distinguishes\nferromagnetic $J_2$ from the $J_2 = 0$ case. We briefly comment on a recent\nreport of the creation of a 1/9th site depleted triangular lattice cobalt\nhydroxide oxalate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 21:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

Two ways to model delays on a network are presented. The first\nmodel assumes that each link delivers messages with a fixed (constant) amount\nof delay, and the second model is more realistic, allowing for i.i.d.\ntime-varying bounded delays. In contrast to previous work studying the effects\nof delays on consensus algorithms, the models studied here allow for a node to\nreceive multiple messages from the same neighbor in one iteration. The analysis\nof the fixed delay model shows that convergence to a consensus is guaranteed\nand the rate of convergence is reduced by no more than a factor O(B^2) where B\nis the maximum delay on any link. For the time-varying delay model we also give\na convergence proof which, for row-stochastic consensus protocols, is not a\ntrivial consequence of ergodic matrix products. In both delay models, the\nconsensus value is no longer the average, even if the original protocol was an\naveraging protocol. For this reason, we propose the use of a different\nconsensus algorithm called Push-Sum [Kempe et al. 2003]. We model delays in the\nPush-Sum framework and show that convergence to the average consensus is\nguaranteed. This suggests that Push-Sum might be a better choice from a\npractical standpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 22:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

In this paper, we propose a game theoretical approach that allows\ncognitive radio pairs, namely the primary user (PU) and the secondary user\n(SU), to update their transmission powers and frequencies simultaneously.\nSpecifically, we address a Stackelberg game model in which individual users\nattempt to hierarchically access to the wireless spectrum while maximizing\ntheir energy efficiency. A thorough analysis of the existence, uniqueness and\ncharacterization of the Stackelberg equilibrium is conducted. In particular, we\nshow that a spectrum coordination naturally occurs when both actors in the\nsystem decide sequentially about their powers and their transmitting carriers.\nAs a result, spectrum sensing in such a situation turns out to be a simple\ndetection of the presence/absence of a transmission on each sub-band. We also\nshow that when users experience very different channel gains on their two\ncarriers, they may choose to transmit on the same carrier at the Stackelberg\nequilibrium as this contributes enough energy efficiency to outweigh the\ninterference degradation caused by the mutual transmission. Then, we provide an\nalgorithmic analysis on how the PU and the SU can reach such a spectrum\ncoordination using an appropriate learning process.

One mechanism to reconcile the simulations with\nthe observed data is the feedback from star formation, this might be successful\nin isolated dwarf galaxies but its success in LSB galaxies remains unclear.\nAdditionally, including too much feedback in the simulations is a double-edged\nsword, in order to obtain a cored DM distribution from an initially cuspy one,\nthe feedback recipes usually require to remove a large quantity of baryons from\nthe center of galaxies, however, some feedback recipes produce twice more\nsatellite galaxies of a given luminosity and with much smaller mass to light\nratios from those that are observed.

Since this is the Brauer\nalgebra of highest degree which is semisimple, our generator is an exact\nanalogue for the Brauer algebra of the Jones idempotent of the Temperley-Lieb\nalgebra. In the orthogonal case the additional relation is also a\nquasi-idempotent in the integral Brauer algebra. Both integral and quantum\nanalogues of these results are given, the latter of which involve the BMW\nalgebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 05:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

The angular differential imaging (ADI) technique is\none of them, initially developed for point-like sources but now increasingly\napplied to extended objects. This new field of application raises many\nquestions because the disk images reduced with ADI depend strongly on the\namplitude of field rotation and the ADI data reduction strategy. Both of them\ndirectly affect the disk observable properties. Our aim is to characterize the\napplicability and biases of some ADI data reduction strategies for different\ndisk morphologies. A particular emphasis is placed on parameters mostly used\nfor disks: their surface brightness, their width for a ring, and local features\nsuch as gaps or asymmetries. We first present a general method for predicting\nand quantifying those biases. In a second step we illustrate them for some\nwidely used ADI algorithms applied to typical debris disk morphologies:\ninclined rings with various inner/outer slopes and width. Last, our aim is also\nto propose improvements of classical ADI to limit the biases on extended\nobjects. Simulated disks seen under various observing conditions were used to\nreduce ADI data and quantify the resulting biases. These conclusions\ncomplements previous results from NaCo L' real-disk images of HR4796A. ADI\ninduces flux losses on disks. This makes this technique appropriate only for\nlow- to medium-inclination disks. A theoretical criterion is derived to predict\nthe amount of flux loss for a given disk morphology, and quantitative estimates\nof the biases are given in some specific configurations. These biases alter the\ndisk observable properties, such as the slopes of their surface brightness or\ntheir radial/azimuthal extent. Additionally, this work demonstrates that ADI\ncan very easily create artificial features without involving astrophysical\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 07:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\napplication of a relative location algorithm (hypoDD) revealed important\nfeatures about the spatial distribution of the earthquakes.

Intra-day variability was detected on 6 nights for 2\nsources out of the 18 nights and 4 sources for which we collected such data.\nThese new optical observations of these blazars plus data from our previous\npublished papers (for 3 more blazars) were used to analyze their spectral flux\ndistributions in the optical frequency range. Our full sample for this purpose\nincludes 6 high-synchrotron-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HSPs), 3\nintermediate-synchrotron-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (ISPs) and 6\nlow-synchrotron-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (LSPs; including both BL Lacs and\nFSRQs). We also investigated the spectral slope variability and found that the\naverage spectral slopes of LSPs show a good accordance with the Synchrotron\nSelf-Compton (SSC) loss dominated model. Our analysis supports previous studies\nthat found that the spectra of the HSPs and FSRQs have significant additional\nemission components. The spectra of all these HSPs and LSPs get flatter when\nthey become brighter, while for FSRQs the opposite appears to hold. This\nsupports the hypothesis that there is a significant thermal contribution to the\noptical spectrum for FSRQs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 10:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-21"}

By changing the\nneutrino luminosity and its decay time to obtain parametric explosions in\none-(1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models with or without a 13-isotope alpha\nnetwork, we study how the inclusion of nuclear burning could affect the\npostbounce dynamics for four progenitor models; three for 15.0 Msun stars, one\nfor an 11.2 Msun star. We find that the energy supply due to nuclear burning of\ninfalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especially\nfor models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear\nburning. These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock\nfront passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches the\noxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, a\ndiagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for models\nwith nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out\nthat these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in\nboth 1D and 2D, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer\nwith its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, so\nthat the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce. The\nenergy difference is generally smaller (~0.1-0.2 times 10^51 erg) in 2D than in\n1D (at most ~0.6 times 10^51 erg). This is because neutrino-driven convection\nand the shock instability in 2D models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency,\nwhich makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to\n1D models. Considering uncertainties in progenitor models, our results indicate\nthat nuclear burning should remain as one of the important ingredients to\nfoster the onset of neutrino-driven explosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 11:31:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 06:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

These planets,\ninstead, form at larger radii and then move into the region in which they now\norbit. The exact process that leads to the formation of these close-in planets\nis, however, unclear and it seems that there may be more than one mechanism\nthat can produce these short-period systems. Dynamical interactions in\nmultiple-planet systems can scatter planets into highly eccentric orbits which,\nif the pericentre is sufficiently close to the parent star, can be tidally\ncircularised by tidal interactions between the planet and star. Furthermore,\nsystems with distant planetary or stellar companions can undergo Kozai cycles\nwhich can result in a planet orbiting very close to its parent star. However,\nthe most developed model for the origin of short period planets is one in which\nthe planet exchanges angular momentum with the surrounding protoplanetary disc\nand spirals in towards the central star. In the case of 'hot Jupiters', the\nplanet is expected to open a gap in the disc and migrate through Type II\n.migration. If this is the dominant mechanism for producing `hot Jupiters' then\nwe would expect the currect properties of observed close-in giant planets to be\nconsistent with an initial population resulting from Type II migration followed\nby evolution due to tidal interactions with the central star. We consider\ninitial distributions that are consistent with Type II migration and find that\nafter tidal evolution, the final distributions can be consistent with that\nobserved.

In this\npaper, it is shown that the old scenario of conformal symmetry breaking in\ncosmology, if properly interpreted, not only has a potential ability to\ndescribe the origin of dark energy as a symmetry breaking effect, but also may\nresolve the coincidence problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 12:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 20:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 19:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-13"}

This follows from a\nlocalization of the authors' proof of the global Caratheodory conjecture.\n  The link between the two is a semi-local technique that we term \"totally real\nblow-up\". Topologically, given a real surface in a complex surface, the totally\nreal blow-up is the connect sum of the real surface with an embedded real\nprojective plane. We show that this increases the sum of the complex indices of\nthe real surface by 1, and hence cancels isolated hyperbolic complex points.\n  This leads to a reduction of the local result to the global result (the\nnon-existence of embedded Lagrangian surfaces with a single complex point),\nwhich proves that the umbilic index for smooth surfaces is less than 2.\n  Comparison of our smooth result with that of Hans Hamburger in the real\nanalytic case (stating that the index of an isolated umbilic point on a real\nanalytic convex surface is less than or equal to 1) suggests the existence of\n\"exotic\" umbilic points of index 3/2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 14:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-26"}

Its main scientific objective is to reveal the formation and\nevolution of our Galaxy through chemo-dynamical analysis. In addition to\ninferring positions, parallaxes and proper motions from the astrometry, we must\nalso infer the astrophysical parameters of the stars from the\nspectrophotometry, the BP/RP spectrum. Here we investigate the performance of\nthree different algorithms (SVM, ILIUM, Aeneas) for estimating the effective\ntemperature, line-of-sight interstellar extinction, metallicity and surface\ngravity of A-M stars over a wide range of these parameters and over the full\nmagnitude range Gaia will observe (G=6-20mag). One of the algorithms, Aeneas,\ninfers the posterior probability density function over all parameters, and can\noptionally take into account the parallax and the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nto improve the estimates. For all algorithms the accuracy of estimation depends\non G and on the value of the parameters themselves, so a broad summary of\nperformance is only approximate. For stars at G=15 with less than two\nmagnitudes extinction, we expect to be able to estimate Teff to within 1%, logg\nto 0.1-0.2dex, and [Fe/H] (for FGKM stars) to 0.1-0.2dex, just using the BP/RP\nspectrum (mean absolute error statistics are quoted).

Extinction can be\nestimated to an accuracy of 0.05-0.2mag for stars across the full parameter\nrange with a priori unknown extinction between 0 and 10mag. Performance\ndegrades at fainter magnitudes, but even at G=19 we can estimate logg to better\nthan 0.2dex for all spectral types, and [Fe/H] to within 0.35dex for FGKM\nstars, for extinctions below 1mag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 14:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 06:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Because of\nthese practical limitations, our current observational aim at detecting and\ncharacterizing planets puts heavy constraints on target selection, observing\nstrategies, data reduction, and follow-up. Most surveys so far have thus\ntargeted young systems (1-100Myr) to catch the putative remnant thermal\nradiation of giant planets, which peaks in the near-IR. They also favor systems\nin the solar neighborhood (d<80pc), which eases angular resolution requirements\nbut also ensures a good knowledge of the distance and proper motion, which are\ncritical to secure the planet status, and enable subsequent characterization.\nBecause of their youth, it is very tempting to target the nearby star forming\nregions, which are typically twice as far as the bulk of objects usually combed\nfor planets by direct imaging. Probing these interesting reservoirs sets\nadditional constraints that we review in this paper by presenting the planet\nsearch that we initiated in 2008 around the disk-bearing T Tauri star IM Lup\n(Lupus star forming region, 140-190pc). We show and discuss why age\ndetermination, the choice of evolutionary model for the central star and the\nplanet, precise knowledge of the host star proper motion, relative or absolute\nastrometric accuracy, and patience are the key ingredients for exoplanet\nsearches around more distant young stars. Unfortunately, most of the time,\nprecision and perseverance are not paying off: we discovered a candidate\ncompanion around IM Lup in 2008, which we report here to be an unbound\nbackground object.

However, the lower onset\n$\\Gamma_c$ is not well defined as it depends strongly on the acceleration ramp\nspeed and also on the magnetic interaction strength. Metastability is observed\nwhen the driving is rapidly quenched from high acceleration, $\\Gamma >\n\\Gamma_{\\rm l}$, to a low final excitation $\\Gamma_q$. After this quench, solid\nclusters nucleate after a time lag $\\tau_o$, either immediately ($\\tau_o = 0$)\nor after some time lag ($\\tau_o>0$) that can vary from seconds up to several\nhundreds of seconds. The immediate growth occurs below a particular\nacceleration value $\\Gamma_s$ ($\\lesssim \\Gamma_c$). In all cases, for $t \\geq\n\\tau_o$ solid cluster's temporal growth can be phenomenologically described by\na stretched exponential law. Finally, by taking into account the finite size of\nour system and by using simple assumptions we propose an alternative tractable\ntheoretical model that reproduces cluster's growth, but which analytical form\nis not a stretched exponential law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 15:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

While in most situations spins and\norbitals develop long-range order, the possibility for the ground state to be a\nquantum liquid opens new perspectives. In this paper, we provide clear evidence\nthat the SU(4) symmetric Kugel-Khomskii model on the honeycomb lattice is a\nquantum spin-orbital liquid. The absence of any form of symmetry breaking -\nlattice or SU(N) - is supported by a combination of semiclassical and numerical\napproaches: flavor-wave theory, tensor network algorithm, and exact\ndiagonalizations. In addition, all properties revealed by these methods are\nvery accurately accounted for by a projected variational wave-function based on\nthe \\pi-flux state of fermions on the honeycomb lattice at 1/4-filling. In that\nstate, correlations are algebraic because of the presence of a Dirac point at\nthe Fermi level, suggesting that the symmetric Kugel-Khomskii model on the\nhoneycomb lattice is an algebraic quantum spin-orbital liquid. This model\nprovides a good starting point to understand the recently discovered\nspin-orbital liquid behavior of Ba_3CuSb_2O_9. The present results also suggest\nto choose optical lattices with honeycomb geometry in the search for quantum\nliquids in ultra-cold four-color fermionic atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 15:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}
