For a pilot subsample of the KINGFISH program, we perform 2 temperature\nfits of the Spitzer and Herschel photometric data (24 to 500um), with a warm\nand a cold component, globally and in each resolution element.At global scales,\nwe observe ranges of values for beta_c(0.8 to 2.5) and Tc(19.1 to 25.1K).We\ncompute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustness\nof the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. When the emissivity\nis fixed, we observe temperature gradients as a function of radius.When the\nemissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniform\nfitted emissivities.Gathering resolved elements in a Tc-beta_c diagram\nunderlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters.It remains difficult\nto assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, or\nmixing along the line of sight and in the beam. We finally observe in both\ncases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and bar\nends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in these\nlocations).We also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptions\nabout the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverage\nused in the fits. We show that modified blackbody fits using a shallow\nemissivity (beta_c < 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared to\nthe beta_c < 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50% if beta_c=1.5 for\ninstance.The working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: masses\nincrease from global fits to spatially-resolved fits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 17:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 08:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

With\nxi_> the largest and xi_< the smallest bulk correlation length at a given\ntemperature near criticality, we find that the dependence of these functions on\nthe ratio xi_< / xi_> and on the angle parameterizing the orientation of the\ncorrelation volume is of geometric rather than dynamic origin. Since the\nscaling functions are independent of the particular microscopic realization of\nthe anisotropy within the two-dimensional Ising model, our results provide a\nlimited verification of universality. We explain our observations by\nconsidering finite-size scaling of free energy densities of general weakly\nanisotropic models on a d-dimensional film, i.e., in an L x infinity^(d-1)\ngeometry, with bc in the finite direction that are invariant under a shear\ntransformation relating the anisotropic and isotropic cases. This allows us to\nrelate free energy scaling functions in the presence of an anisotropy to those\nof the corresponding isotropic system. We interpret our results as a simple and\ntransparent case of anisotropic universality, where, compared to the isotropic\ncase, scaling functions depend additionally on the shape and orientation of the\ncorrelation volume.

Whereas this conjecture remains open, modified forms of it were shown\nto be true, when assuming that the assignment of weights to the secretaries is\nnot adversarial but uniformly random (Soto [SODA 2011], Oveis Gharan and\nVondr\\'ak [ESA 2011]). However, so far, there was no variant of the matroid\nsecretary problem with adversarial weight assignment for which a\nconstant-factor approximation was found. We address this point by presenting a\n9-approximation for the \\emph{free order model}, a model suggested shortly\nafter the introduction of the matroid secretary problem, and for which no\nconstant-factor approximation was known so far. The free order model is a\nrelaxed version of the original matroid secretary problem, with the only\ndifference that one can choose the order in which secretaries are interviewed.\n  Furthermore, we consider the classical matroid secretary problem for the\nspecial case of laminar matroids. Only recently, a constant-factor\napproximation has been found for this case, using a clever but rather involved\nmethod and analysis (Im and Wang, [SODA 2011]) that leads to a\n16000/3-approximation. This is arguably the most involved special case of the\nmatroid secretary problem for which a constant-factor approximation is known.\nWe present a considerably simpler and stronger $3\\sqrt{3}e\\approx\n14.12$-approximation, based on reducing the problem to a matroid secretary\nproblem on a partition matroid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 19:23:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 17:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-24"}

Using a combinatorial approach,\nwe are able to give a nice characterization of informative strategies (i.e.,\nstrategies allowing Bob to learn Alice's hand), having optimal communication\ncomplexity, namely the set of possible hands Alice announces must be equivalent\nto a large set of $t-(n, a, 1)$-designs, where $t=a-c$.

Specifically, for an alphabet of prime cardinality, where\nlinear codes achieve the best known exponents in the single-user setting and\nthe optimal exponent above the critical rate, this performance carries over to\nthe MAC setting. At least at low rates, where expurgation is needed, our\napproach strictly improves performance over previous results, where expurgation\nwas used at most for one of the users. Even when the MAC channel is not\nadditive, it may be transformed into such a channel. While the transformation\nis lossy, we show that the distributed structure gain in some \"nearly additive\"\ncases outweighs the loss, and thus the error exponent can improve upon the best\nknown error exponent for these cases as well. Finally we apply a similar\napproach to the Gaussian MAC channel. We obtain an improvement over the best\nknown achievable exponent, given by Gallager, for certain rate pairs, using\nlattice codes which satisfy a nesting condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 19:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The unique spectral and temporal capabilities of the XRT\nWindowed Timing mode have allowed us to extend the GBM spectral coverage for\nthese events down to the X-ray domain (0.5-10 keV). Our earlier analysis of the\nGBM data found that the SGR J1550-5418 burst spectra were described equally\nwell with a Comptonized model or with two blackbody functions; the two models\nwere statistically indistinguishable.

Several models have been proposed for predicting\ntechnological improvement, but how well do these models perform? An early\nhypothesis made by Theodore Wright in 1936 is that cost decreases as a power\nlaw of cumulative production. An alternative hypothesis is Moore's law, which\ncan be generalized to say that technologies improve exponentially with time.\nOther alternatives were proposed by Goddard, Sinclair et al., and Nordhaus.\nThese hypotheses have not previously been rigorously tested. Using a new\ndatabase on the cost and production of 62 different technologies, which is the\nmost expansive of its kind, we test the ability of six different postulated\nlaws to predict future costs. Our approach involves hindcasting and developing\na statistical model to rank the performance of the postulated laws. Wright's\nlaw produces the best forecasts, but Moore's law is not far behind. We discover\na previously unobserved regularity that production tends to increase\nexponentially. A combination of an exponential decrease in cost and an\nexponential increase in production would make Moore's law and Wright's law\nindistinguishable, as originally pointed out by Sahal. We show for the first\ntime that these regularities are observed in data to such a degree that the\nperformance of these two laws is nearly tied. Our results show that\ntechnological progress is forecastable, with the square root of the logarithmic\nerror growing linearly with the forecasting horizon at a typical rate of 2.5%\nper year. These results have implications for theories of technological change,\nand assessments of candidate technologies and policies for climate change\nmitigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 21:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

By replacing the\nterrestrial minimum with a pelagic one, at roughly 7000g, the terrestrial\nmammal tradeoff model accurately predicts, with no tunable parameters, the\nobserved body masses of all extant cetacean species, including the 175,000,000g\nBlue Whale. This strong agreement between theory and data suggests that a\nuniversal macroevolutionary tradeoff governs body size evolution for all\nmammals, regardless of their habitat. The dramatic sizes of cetaceans can thus\nbe attributed mainly to the increased convective heat loss is water, which\nshifts the species size distribution upward and pushes its right tail into\nranges inaccessible to terrestrial mammals. Under this macroevolutionary\ntradeoff, the largest expected species occurs where the rate at which\nsmaller-bodied species move up into large-bodied niches approximately equals\nthe rate at which extinction removes them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 22:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 23:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-14"}

There are also many natural cones that can been\nregarded as \"more\" or \"less\" positive than these standard examples. In\nparticular, entanglement theory deals with the cones of separable operators and\nentanglement witnesses, which satisfy very strong and weak positivity\nproperties respectively.\n  Rather complementary to the various cones that arise in entanglement theory\nare norms. The trace and operator norms for operators and the diamond and\ncompletely bounded norms for superoperators are the typical norms that are seen\nthroughout quantum information theory. In this work our main goal is to develop\na family of norms that play a role analogous to the cone of entanglement\nwitnesses.

Having examined the\npossible motivations arising from improved scientific knowledge and access to\nextraterrestrial raw materials, he concludes that the ultimate benefits of\nspace colonisation will be the increased opportunities for developing human\n(and post-human) diversity, intellectual and aesthetic potential and,\nespecially, 'spirituality'. By the latter concept he meant a striving for\n\"sensitive and intelligent awareness of things in the universe (including\npersons), and of the universe as a whole.\" A key insight articulated by\nStapledon in this lecture was that this should be the aspiration of all human\ndevelopment anyway, with or without space colonisation, but that the latter\nwould greatly increase the scope for such developments. Another key aspect of\nhis vision was the development of a diverse, but connected, 'Commonwealth of\nWorlds' extending throughout the Solar System, and eventually beyond, within\nwhich human potential would be maximised. In this paper I analyse Stapledon's\nvision of space colonisation, and will conclude that his overall conclusions\nremain sound.

Recently, the $f(T)$ gravity has been invoked as an\nalternative approach for explaining the observed acceleration expansion of the\nUniverse. If gravity is described by a $f(T)$ theory instead of general\nrelativity, there are a number of issues that ought to be reexamined in the\nframework of $f(T)$ theories. In this work, to proceed further with the current\ninvestigation of the limits and potentialities of the $f(T)$ gravity theories,\nwe derive and discuss the bounds imposed by the energy conditions on a general\n$f(T)$ functional form. The null and strong energy conditions in the framework\nof $f(T)$ gravity are derived from first principles, namely the purely\ngeometric Raychaudhuri's equation along with the requirement that gravity is\nattractive. The weak and dominant energy conditions are then obtained in a\ndirect approach via an effective energy-momentum tensor for $f(T)$ gravity.\nAlthough similar, the energy condition inequalities are different from those of\ngeneral relativity (GR), but in the limit $f(T)=T$ the standard forms for the\nenergy conditions in GR are recovered. As a concrete application of the derived\nenergy conditions to locally homogeneous and isotropic $f(T)$ cosmology, we use\nthe recent estimated value of the Hubble parameter to set bounds from the weak\nenergy condition on the parameters of two specific families of $f(T)$ gravity\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 01:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 03:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 02:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-10"}

The bump can be approximated by a thermal emission\ncomponent of temperature 1500 K that is of the order of the sublimation\ntemperature of interstellar dust grains. In the currently popular \"puffed up\nrim\" scenario, the bump represents stellar radiation that propagates through\nthe optically thin inner region of the surrounding accretion disk and is\nabsorbed and reemitted by the dust that resides just beyond the dust\nsublimation radius, Rsub. However, this model cannot account for the strongest\nbumps measured in these sources, and it predicts a large secondary bounce in\nthe interferometric visibility curve that is not observed. In this paper we\npresent an alternative interpretation, which attributes the bump to reemission\nof stellar radiation by dust that is uplifted from the disk by a centrifugally\ndriven wind. Winds of this type are a leading candidate for the origin of the\nstrong outflows associated with protostars, and there is observational evidence\nfor disk winds originating on scales ~Rsub. Using a newly constructed Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer code, we show that this model can account for the NIR\nexcess emission even in bright Herbig Ae stars such as AB Auriga and MWC 275,\nand that it successfully reproduces the basic features of the visibilities\nmeasured in these protostars. We argue that a robust dusty outflow in these\nsources could be self-limiting to a relatively narrow launching region between\nRsub and 2Rsub. Finally, we suggest that our model could also naturally account\nfor the NIR and scattered-light variability exhibited by a source like MWC 275,\nwhich may be triggered by the uplifting of dust clouds from the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 03:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 21:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Lithium is easily destroyed by proton capture in stellar\nenvironments, so its abundance may be crucial to discriminate among different\nmodels proposed to account for multiple populations. In order to reproduce the\nobserved O-Na anticorrelation and other patterns typical of multiple\npopulations, the formation of second generation stars must occur from the\nnuclearly processed stellar ejecta, responsible of the chemical anomalies,\ndiluted with pristine gas having the composition of first generation stars. The\nlithium abundance in the unprocessed gas -which is very likely to be equal to\nthe lithium abundance emerging from the Big Bang- affects the lithium chemical\npatterns among the cluster stars. This paper focuses on a scenario in which\nprocessed gas is provided by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine\nthe predictions of this scenario for the lithium abundances of multiple\npopulations. We study the role of the non-negligible lithium abundance in the\nejecta of massive AGB (A(Li)~2), and, at the same time, we explore how our\nmodels can constrain the extremely large ---and very model dependent--- lithium\nyields predicted by recent super--AGB models. We show that the super--AGB\nyields may be tested by examining the lithium abundances in a large set of blue\nmain sequence stars in wCen and/or NGC2808. In addition, we examine the\ndifferent model results obtained by assuming for the pristine gas either the\nBig Bang abundance predicted by the standard models (A(Li)=2.6-2.7), or the\nabundance detected at the surface of population II stars (A(Li)=2.2-2.3). Once\na chemical model is well constrained, the O--Li distribution could perhaps be\nused to shed light on the primordial lithium abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 07:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In the present calculation, we consider\nnot only the tensor coupling of vector mesons to octet baryons and the form\nfactors at interaction vertexes but also the internal (quark) structure change\nof baryons in dense matter. The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are\nperformed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants\ndetermined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling\nconstants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the\nlatest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle\ncomposition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from\nthat in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the\ndensity region below $\\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the\n\\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal\nbaryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter. Taking all\nthese effects into account, we can obtain the maximum neutron-star mass which\nis consistent with the recently observed mass, 1.97 \\pm 0.04 M_\\sun (PSR\nJ1614-2230). We therefore conclude that the extension from SU(6) symmetry to\nSU(3) symmetry in the meson-baryon couplings and the internal baryon-structure\nvariation in matter certainly enhance the mass of neutron star.

Here we report the first\ndetection of SN1957D in X-rays, as part of a 729 ks observation of M83 with\n\\chandra. The X-ray luminosity (0.3 - 8 keV) is 1.7 (+2.4,-0.3) 10**37 ergs/s.\nThe spectrum is hard and highly self-absorbed compared to most sources in M83\nand to other young supernova remnants, suggesting that the system is dominated\nat X-ray wavelengths by an energetic pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula. The\nhigh column density may be due to absorption within the SN ejecta. HST WFC3\nimages resolve the supernova remnant from the surrounding emission and the\nlocal star field. Photometry of stars around SN1957D, using WFC3 images,\nindicates an age of less than 10**7 years and a main sequence turnoff mass more\nthan 17 solar masses. New spectra obtained with Gemini-South show that the\noptical spectrum continues to be dominated by broad [O III] emission lines, the\nsignature of fast-moving SN ejecta. The width of the broad lines has remained\nabout 2700 km/s (FWHM).

The targets span a large range of reddening, E(B-V)\n~ 0.2 -- 1.0, and are distributed over a large sky area and involve a wide\nrange of stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity and\nmetallicity), confirming that the carriers of DIBs are ubiquitous in the\ndiffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The sample is used to investigate relations\nbetween strengths of DIBs and magnitudes of line-of-sight extinction, yielding\nresults (i.e., EW(5780)= 0.61 x E(B-V) and EW(6283) = 1.26 x E(B-V)) consistent\nwith previous studies. DIB features have also been detected in the\ncommissioning spectra of the Guoshoujing Telescope (LAMOST) of resolving power\nsimilar to that of SDSS. Detections of DIBs towards hundreds of thousands of\nstars are expected from the on-going and up-coming large scale spectroscopic\nsurveys such as RAVE, SDSS III and LAMOST, particularly from the LAMOST Digital\nSky Survey of the Galactic Anti-center (DSS-GAC). Such a huge database will\nprovide an unprecedented opportunity to study the demographical distribution\nand nature of DIBs as well as using DIBs to probe the distribution and\nproperties of the ISM and the dust extinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 10:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We argue that the bright loop often seen as the CME leading edge is\nthe result of pileup at the boundary of the erupting flux rope irrespective of\nwhether a cavity or, more generally, a 3-part CME can be identified. Based on\nour previous work on white light shock detection and supported by the MHD\nsimulations, we identify a new type of morphology, the `two-front' morphology.\nIt consists of a faint front followed by diffuse emission and the bright\nloop-like CME leading edge. We show that the faint front is caused by density\ncompression at a wave (or possibly shock) front driven by the CME. We also\npresent high-detailed multi-wavelength EUV observations that clarify the\nrelative positioning of the prominence at the bottom of a coronal cavity with\nclear flux rope structure. Finally, we visually check the full LASCO CME\ndatabase for flux rope structures. In the process, we classify the events into\ntwo clear flux rope classes (`3-part', `Loop'), jets and outflows (no clear\nstructure). We find that at least 40% of the observed CMEs have clear flux rope\nstructures. We propose a new definition for flux rope CMEs (FR-CMEs) as a\ncoherent magnetic, twist-carrying coronal structure with angular width of at\nleast 40 deg and able to reach beyond 10 Rsun which erupts on a time scale of a\nfew minutes to several hours.

Direct\ngas-phase condensation of MgS occurs at a low efficiency. Precipitation of MgS\non SiC precursor grains provides a more efficient formation mechanism, such\nthat the assumption of homogeneous MgS grains may not be correct. Using a Monte\nCarlo-based radiative transfer code, we aim to model the 30 \\mu m feature of\nthe extreme carbon star LL Peg with MgS dust particles. We find that for LL Peg\nthis modeling is insensitive to the unknown MgS optical properties at \\lambda <\n10 \\mu m. When MgS is allowed to be in thermal contact with amorphous carbon\nand SiC, the amount of MgS required to reproduce the strength of 30 \\mu m\nfeature agrees with the solar abundance of sulfur, thereby resolving the\nreported MgS mass problem.

A major interest is that this allows to develop a consistent\ntheory of quantum measurement in continuous time for these non-Markovian\nquantum trajectory models. In this context, the notions of instrument, a priori\nand a posteriori states are rigorously described. The key point is that by\nstarting from a stochastic equation on the Hilbert space of the system, we are\nable to respect the complete positivity of the mean dynamics for the\nstatistical operator and the requirements of the axioms of quantum measurement\ntheory.

This process is found to be enhanced\nfor the case that we immobilize the grafted chains, i.e. the sub-diffusive\nbehavior sets in at an earlier time and spans over a longer time period before\nbecoming diffusive.

It was later observed\nand detected with high significance by the Southern Cherenkov observatory\nH.E.S.S. Detection from the Northern hemisphere is difficult due to challenging\nobservation conditions under large zenith angles. In July 2006, the H.E.S.S.\ncollaboration reported an extraordinary outburst of VHE gamma-emission. During\nthe outburst, the VHE gamma-ray emission was found to be variable on the time\nscales of minutes and with a mean flux of ~7 times the flux observed from the\nCrab Nebula. Follow-up observations with the MAGIC-I standalone Cherenkov\ntelescope were triggered by this extraordinary outburst and PKS 2155-304 was\nobserved between 28 July to 2 August 2006 for 15 hours at large zenith angles.\nHere we present our studies on the behavior of the source after its\nextraordinary flare and an enhanced analysis method for data taken at high\nzenith angles. We developed improved methods for event selection that led to a\nbetter background suppression. The averaged energy spectrum we derived has a\nspectral index of -3.5 +/- 0.2 above 400GeV, which is in good agreement with\nthe spectral shape measured by H.E.S.S. during the major flare on MJD 53944.\nFurthermore, we present the spectral energy distribution modeling of PKS\n2155-304. With our observations we increased the duty cycle of the source\nextending the light curve derived by H.E.S.S. after the outburst.

Apart from fundamental significance, hybrid systems\ncan be exploited for practical purpose, noteworthily in the emerging field of\nquantum information control. A promising direction is provided by the\ncombination between long-lived atomic states and the accessible electrical\ndegrees of freedom in superconducting cavities and qubits.

The tensor force active in the isosinglet\nneutron-proton interaction channel leads to appreciable depletion/population of\nnucleons below/above the Fermi surface in the single-nucleon momentum\ndistribution in cold symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). We found that as a\nconsequence of the high momentum tail in SNM the kinetic part of the symmetry\nenergy $E^{kin}_{sym}(\\rho)$ is significantly below the well-known Fermi gas\nmodel prediction of approximately $12.5 (\\rho/\\rho_0)^{2/3}$.

These features have recently been confirmed by three independent studies\nbased on the state-of-the-art microscopic nuclear many-body theories.

Among the most relevant cases in which\nthe effective temperatures thus defined were shown to have a thermodynamic\nmeaning one finds the stationary dynamics of driven super-cooled liquids and\nvortex glasses, and the relaxation of glasses. Whether and under which\nconditions an effective thermal behavior can be found in quantum isolated\nmany-body systems after a global quench is a question of current interest. We\npropose to study the possible emergence of thermal behavior long after the\nquench by studying fluctuation-dissipation relations in which (possibly time-\nor frequency-dependent) parameters replace the equilibrium temperature. If\nthermalization within the Gibbs ensemble eventually occurs these parameters\nshould be constant and equal for all pairs of observables in \"partial\" or\n\"mutual\" equilibrium. We analyze these relations in the paradigmatic quantum\nsystem, i.e., the quantum Ising chain, in the stationary regime after a quench\nof the transverse field. The lack of thermalization to a Gibbs ensemble becomes\napparent within this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 15:11:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 15:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The drawback of the greedy algorithm is\nthat it requires $O(m \\cdot (n^{1 + 1/k} + n \\cdot \\log n))$ time. The other\nalgorithm is due to Awerbuch et al. \\cite{ABP91}. It constructs $O(k)$-spanners\nwith $O(k \\cdot n^{1 + 1/k} \\cdot \\Lambda)$ edges, weight $O(k^2 \\cdot n^{1/k}\n\\cdot \\Lambda) \\cdot \\omega(MST(G))$, within time $O(m \\cdot k \\cdot n^{1/k}\n\\cdot \\Lambda)$, where $\\Lambda$ is the logarithm of the aspect ratio of the\ngraph. The running time of both these algorithms is unsatisfactory. Moreover,\nthe usually faster algorithm of \\cite{ABP91} pays for the speedup by\nsignificantly increasing both the stretch, the sparsity, and the weight of the\nresulting spanner.\n  In this paper we devise an efficient algorithm for constructing sparse and\nlight spanners. Specifically, our algorithm constructs $((2k-1) \\cdot\n(1+\\eps))$-spanners with $O(k \\cdot n^{1 + 1/k})$ edges and weight $O(k \\cdot\nn^{1/k}) \\cdot \\omega(MST(G))$, where $\\eps > 0$ is an arbitrarily small\nconstant. The running time of our algorithm is $O(k \\cdot m + \\min\\{n \\cdot\n\\log n,m \\cdot \\alpha(n)\\})$. Moreover, by slightly increasing the running time\nwe can reduce the other parameters. These results address an open problem from\nthe ESA'04 paper by Roditty and Zwick \\cite{RZ04}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 15:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-09"}

The energy of the two nuclei is conserved and remains small during the\nmotion through the Coulomb barrier. The penetration through this barrier, which\nis the main obstacle for low-energy fusion, strongly depends on a form of the\nincident flux on the Coulomb center at large distances from it. In contrast to\nthe usual scattering, the incident wave is not a single plane wave but the\ncertain superposition of plane waves of the same energy and various directions,\nfor example, a convergent conical wave. As a result of interference, the wave\nfunction close to the Coulomb center is determined by a cusp caustic which is\nprobed by de Broglie waves. The particle flux gets away from the cusp and moves\nto the Coulomb center providing a not small probability of fusion (cusp driven\ntunneling).

The theory is based on an ansatz for the Helmholtz free energy\nwhere both the deviatoric and the volumetric contributions to the free energy\nare rate-dependent. The requirement that the free energy is fully rate\ndependent arises from the need to model the full range of conditions between\nthose found in quasi-static applications to those common in high-rate shock\nloading scenarios. Using a purely equilibrium equation of state is found to be\ninsufficient. The resulting model, called the Glassy Amorphous Polymer (GAP)\nmodel, suitably captures the thermo-mechanical behavior of both equilibrium\nproperties, but also high-rate phenomena like the shock Hugoniot.\nPolymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is used as a representative polymer because it is\none of the few polymers where sufficient experiments have been done to\ndetermine many of the parameters required by the GAP model. An important part\nof the GAP model is the Hierarchical Flow Stress (HFS) model, which is shown to\naccurately represent the stress-strain behavior of PMMA over a broad range of\nstrain rates and temperatures. The HFS model replicates the details of stress\nplateau, softening, and hardening behavior observed in glassy amorphous\npolymers. The theory is not restricted to isothermal conditions. Analysis is\ndevoted to several issues associated with a non-equilibrium equation of state\n(EOS). Because data is insufficient for the full determination of the model's\nnon-equilibrium EOS, several plausible conditions called the quasi-equilibrium\nhypothesis are put forth to complete the model. Comparisons of experimental and\ntheoretical results over a wide-range of loading rates and conditions are\nreported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jul 2012 19:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-12"}
