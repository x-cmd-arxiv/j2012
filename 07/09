This idea has recently come into the reach of the established\ndomain of silicon technology, leading to the realization of single-atom\ntransistors and to the first measurements of electron spin dynamics in single\ndonors. Here we show that we can electrically couple two donors embedded in a\nmulti-gate silicon transistor, and induce coherent oscillations in their charge\nstates by means of microwave signals. We measure single-electron tunneling\nacross the two donors, which reveals their energy spectrum. The lowest energy\nstates, corresponding to a single electron located on either of the two donors,\nform a two-level system (TLS) well separated from all other electronic levels.\nGigahertz driving of this TLS results in a quantum interference pattern\nassociated with the absorption or the stimulated emission of up to ten\nmicrowave photons. We estimate a charge dephasing time of 0.3 nanoseconds,\nconsistent with other types of charge quantum bits. Here, however, the\nrelatively short coherence time can be counterbalanced by fast operation\nsignals (in principle up to 1 terahertz) as allowed by the large empty energy\nwindow separating ground and excited states in donor atoms. The demonstrated\ncoherent coupling of two donors constitutes an essential step towards\ndonor-based quantum computing devices in silicon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 16:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-10"}

In Experiment 1, the experimenter described spatial locations\nof fictitious objects sequentially in two conditions: speech condition (SO,\nverbal descriptions clearly indicated the spatial layout) and speech and\ngesture condition (SR, verbal descriptions were ambiguous but accompanied by\nrobotic pointing gestures). Participants were then asked to recall the objects'\nspatial locations. We found that the number of spatial locations recalled in\nthe SR condition was on par with that in the SO condition, suggesting that\ntelerobotic pointing gestures compensated ambiguous speech during the process\nof spatial information. In Experiment 2, the experimenter described spatial\nlocations non-sequentially in the SR and SO conditions.

In a separate paper arxiv:1104.4684, the\nmethods of this paper (but for the most part not the resolution of\nsingularities theorems themselves) are used to prove results concerning\noscillatory integrals, exponential sums, and related matters.\n  Note: This paper should be viewed as a replacement for the resolution of\nsingularities portion of older versions of arxiv:1104.4684, as this paper is\nquite a bit different from that algorithm, and should be a lot easier to read.\nFor one, standard blowups are used here, rather than the monomial maps of\narxiv:1104.4684 which forced one to deal with technical issues related to such\nmonomial maps not necessarily being one to one. Secondly, the complicated\niterated domain subdivisions using Newton polyhedra that were done in\narxiv:1104.4684 have been reduced to a short one-stage argument, given in\nsection 2. Thirdly, forming partitions of unity can be done more naturally in\nthe context of the newer algorithm (see Lemma 3.5).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 18:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 19:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 17:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

The effects of binary interactions and stellar\npopulation mixture are taken into account. The results show some UV-upturn SEDs\nnaturally for bsCSPs. The SEDs of bsCSPs are affected obviously by all of three\nstellar population parameters, and the effects of three parameters are\ndegenerate. This suggests that the effects of metallicity, and the ages of the\nold (major in stellar mass) and young (minor) components of stellar populations\nshould be taken into account in SED studies of early-type galaxies. The\nsensitivities of SEDs at different wavelengths to the inputs of a stellar\npopulation model are also investigated. It is shown that UV SEDs are sensitive\nto all of three stellar population parameters, rather than to only stellar age.\nSpecial wavelength ranges according to some SED features that are relatively\nsensitive to stellar metallicity, young-component age, and old-component age of\nbsCSPs are found by this work. For example, the shapes of SEDs with wavelength\nranges of 5110-5250AA, 5250--5310AA, 5310--5350AA, 5830--5970AA, 20950--23550AA\nare relatively sensitive to the stellar metallicity of bsCSPs.

The model\npresents two liquid phases separated by a critical line. The difference between\nthe two phases is the presence of structure in the liquid of lower density,\ndescribed through orientational order of particles. We have considered the\neffect of small inert solute on the solvent thermodynamic phases. Solute\nstabilizes the structure of solvent, by the organization of solvent particles\naround solute particles, at low temperatures. Thus, even at very high\ndensities, the solution presents clusters of structured water particles\nsurrounding solute inert particles, in a region in which pure solvent would be\nfree of structure. Solute intercalates with solvent, a feature which has been\nsuggested by experimental and atomistic simulation data. Examination of solute\nsolubility has yielded a minimum in that property, which may be associated with\nthe minimum found for noble gases. We have obtained a line of minimum\nsolubility (TmS) across the phase diagram, accompanying the line of maximum in\ndensity (TMD). This coincidence is easily explained for non-interacting solute\nand it is in agreement with earlier results in the literature. We give a simple\nargument which suggests that interacting solute would dislocate TmS to higher\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 20:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A core\nformed via planetesimal accretion induces the fragmentation of surrounding\nplanetesimals, which generally inhibits further growth of the core by removal\nof the resulting fragments due to radial drift caused by gas drag. However, the\nemergence of the pressure maximum halts the drift of the fragments, while their\norbital eccentricities and inclinations are efficiently damped by gas drag. As\na result, the core of Saturn rapidly grows via accretion of the fragments near\nthe pressure maximum. We have found that in the minimum-mass solar nebula,\nkilometer sized planetesimals can produce a core exceeding 10 Earth masses\nwithin two million years. Since Jupiter may not have undergone significant type\nII inward migration, it is likely that Jupiter's formation was completed when\nthe local disk mass has already decayed to a value comparable to or less than\nJovian mass. The expected rapid growth of Saturn's core on a timescale\ncomparable to or shorter than observationally inferred disk lifetime enables\nSaturn to acquire the current amount of envelope gas before the disk gas is\ncompletely depleted. The high heat energy release rate onto the core surface\ndue to the rapid accretion of the fragments delays onset of runaway gas\naccretion until the core mass becomes somewhat larger than that of Jupiter,\nwhich is consistent with the estimate based on interior modeling.

This happens cyclically again and\nagain without violating the null energy condition. There is a special subset of\ngeodesically complete non-generic solutions which perform zero-size bounces\nwithout ever entering the antigravity regime in all cycles. For these, initial\nvalues of the fields are synchronized and quantized but the parameters of the\nmodel are not restricted. There is also a subset of spatial curvature-induced\nsolutions that have finite-size bounces in the gravity regime and never enter\nthe antigravity phase. These exist only within a small continuous domain of\nparameter space without fine tuning initial conditions. To obtain these\nresults, we identified 25 regions of a 6-parameter space in which the complete\nset of analytic solutions are explicitly obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2012 04:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Inon\\\"u and E.P. Wigner introduced the concept of\ndeformation of a Lie algebra by claiming that the limit $1/c \\rightarrow 0$,\nwhen c is the speed of light, of the composition law $(u,v) \\rightarrow\n(u+v)/(1+(uv/c^2))$ of speeds in special relativity (Poincar\\'e group) should\nproduce the composition law $(u,v) \\rightarrow u + v $ used in classical\nmechanics (Galil\\'ee group). However, the dimensionless composition law\n$(u'=u/c,v'=v/c) \\rightarrow (u'+v')/(1+u'v')$ does not contain any longer a\nperturbation parameter. Nevertheless, this idea brought the birth of the \"\ndeformation theory of algebraic structures\", culminating in the use of the\nChevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of Lie algebras and one of the first\napplications of computer algebra in the seventies. One may also notice that the\nmain idea of general relativity is to deform the Minkowski metric of space-time\nby means of the small dimensionless parameter $\\phi/c^2$ where $\\phi=GM/r$ is\nthe gravitational potential at a distance r of a central attractive mass M with\ngravitational constant G. A few years later, a \" deformation theory of\ngeometric structures \" on manifolds of dimension n was introduced and one may\nquote riemannian, symplectic or complex analytic structures. Though often\nconjectured, the link between the two approaches has never been exhibited and\nthe aim of this paper is to provide the solution of this problem by new\nmethods. The key tool is made by the \" Vessiot structure equations \" (1903) for\nLie groups or Lie pseudogroups of transformations, which, contrary to the \"\nCartan structure equations \", are still unknown today and contain \" structure\nconstants \" which, like in the case of constant riemannian curvature, have in\ngeneral nothing to do with any Lie algebra. The main idea is then to introduce\nthe purely differential Janet sequence $0 \\rightarrow \\Theta \\rightarrow T\n\\rightarrow F_0 \\rightarrow F_1 \\rightarrow ... \\rightarrow F_n \\rightarrow 0$\nas a resolution of the sheaf $\\Theta \\subset T$ of infinitesimal\ntransformations and to induce a purely algebraic \" deformation sequence \" with\nfinite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps, even if $\\Theta$ is infinite\ndimensional. The infinitesimal equivalence problem for geometric structures has\nto do with the local exactness at $ F_0 $ of the Janet sequence while the\ndeformation problem for algebraic structures has to do with the exactness of\nthe deformation sequence at the invariant sections of $F_1 $, that is ONE STEP\nFURTHER ON in the sequence and this unexpected result explains why the many\ntentatives previously quoted have not been successful. Finally, we emphasize\nthrough examples the part that could be played by computer algebra in any\nexplicit computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2012 06:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-11"}

According to MD, the TTCs\naround 0.8 are observed in nearly optimal conditions. Reaching higher values\nrequires special efforts and it should be difficult in practice. The TTC can be\npartially responsible for the persistent discrepancies between the twisting\nrigidity of DNA measured by different methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2012 12:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The aim of this study is to calibrate the usage of\nthe H and K wings in one-dimensional interpretation of spatially averaged\nspectra and in deriving per-pixel stratifications from resolved spectra. I use\nmulti-dimensional simulations of solar convection to synthesize the H and K\nwings, derive one-dimensional models from these wings as if they were observed,\nand compare the resulting models to the actual simulation input. I find that\nspatially-averaged models constructed from the synthesized wings generally\nmatch the simulation averages well, except for the deepest layers of the\nphotosphere where large thermal inhomogeneities and Planck-function\nnonlinearity gives large errors. The larger the inhomogeneity, the larger the\nlatter. The presence of strong network fields increases such inhomogeneity. For\nquiet photospheric conditions the temperature excesses reach about 200 K.\nOne-dimensional stratification fits of discrete structures such as granulation\nand small-scale magnetic concentrations give satisfactory results with errors\nthat are primarily due to steep temperature gradients and abrupt changes of\ntemperature with depth. I conclude that stratification modeling using the H and\nK wings is a useful technique for the interpretation of solar high-resolution\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2012 12:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We perform\nhydro-dynamical simulations of the dynamical clearing of a gap in a disk. A\n10Mjup body in a circular orbit at r = 90AU, perturbs the whole disks, even\nafter thousands of orbits. By then the model disk has an eccentric and\nirregular cavity, flanked by tightly wound spiral arms, but it is still\nevolving far from steady state.

However,\nhere the presence of a small number of cooperation facilitators enhances the\nfitness (reproductive potential) of cooperators, while it does not alter that\nof defectors. In a finite population of size N, the dynamics of the prisoner's\ndilemma with facilitators is characterized by the probability that cooperation\ntakes over (fixation probability) and by the mean times to reach the absorbing\nstates.

Our findings, corroborated by stochastic simulations, demonstrate\nthat the influence of facilitators crucially depends on the difference between\ntheir density z and the game's cost-to-benefit ratio r.

If later on,\nthere is a lot of activity in the South, then that flux will help reverse the\nSouth Pole. In this way, we get two humps in solar activity and a corresponding\ndifference in time of reversals. Such difference was first noted by Babcock\n(1959) from the very first observation of polar field reversal just after the\nmaximum of the strongly asymmetric solar cycle 19. At that time, the Southern\nHemisphere was most active before sunspot maximum and the South Pole duly\nreversed first, followed by the Northern Hemisphere more than a year later,\nwhen that hemisphere was most active. Solar cycles since then have had the\nopposite asymmetry, with the Northern Hemisphere being most active early in the\ncycle.

The\nidea of Layered Fault Tolerant Specification (LFTS) is proposed to make the\nmethod extensible to fault tolerant systems. The principle is layering the\nspecification in different levels, the first one for the normal behavior and\nthe others for the abnormal. The abnormal behavior is described in terms of an\nError Injector (EI), which represents a model of the erroneous interference\ncoming from the environment. This structure has been inspired by the notion of\nidealized fault tolerant component but the combination of LFTS and EI using\nRely/Guarantee reasoning to describe their interaction can be considered as a\nnovel contribution. The progress toward this method and this way to organize\nfault tolerant specifications has been made experimenting on case studies and\nan example is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 17:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-12"}
