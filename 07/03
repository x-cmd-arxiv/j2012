E_T^eff and M_eff are complementary variables, rather\nthan competitors; and plotting histograms in both can be useful to cross-check\nthe results, allowing a better and more robust identification of M_susy.

While avoiding any current setpoint overshoot to preserve the\ntip integrity, we present results from approaches of atomically defined\ntungsten tips to the tunneling regime with Au(111), HOPG, and Si(111) surfaces\nat room temperature. We conclude from these experiments that adatom mobility\nand physisorbed gas on the sample surface limit the choice of surfaces for\nwhich the tip integrity is preserved in tunneling experiments at room\ntemperature. The atomic structure of FIM tip apices is unchanged only after\ntunneling to the highly reactive Si(111) surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 17:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

Searches are carried out for hypothesized Higgs boson masses\nbetween 100 and 200 GeV/c^2.

In this paper we argue that cold ultrarelativistic\npulsar winds can be alternative sources of very narrow gamma-ray lines. We\ndemonstrate that Comptonization of a cold ultrarelativistic electron-positron\npulsar wind in the deep Klein-Nishina regime can readily provide very narrow\ndistinct gamma-ray line features.

The confirmation of 130 GeV line\nemission by low-energy threshold atmospheric Cherenkov telescope systems, in\nparticular by the new 27 m diameter dish of the H.E.S.S. array, would be\ncrucial for resolving the spatial structure of the reported hotspots, and thus\nfor distinguishing between the Dark Matter and Pulsar origins of the `Fermi\nLines'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 18:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The value is sufficiently large that either substantially\nenhanced Standard Model contributions or non-Standard Model physics is required\nto explain it. In the latter case only a limited number of possibilities would\nbe consistent with other existing flavor-changing constraints. We show that\nwarped extra dimensional models that explain the quark spectrum through flavor\nanarchy can naturally give rise to contributions of the size required to\nexplain the the LHCb result. The D meson asymmetry arises through a sizable\nCP-violating contribution to a chromomagnetic dipole operator. This happens\nnaturally without introducing inconsistencies with existing constraints in the\nup quark sector. We discuss some subtleties in the loop calculation that are\nsimilar to those in Higgs to \\gamma\\gamma. Loop-induced dipole operators in\nwarped scenarios and their composite analogs exhibit non-trivial dependence on\nthe Higgs profile, with the contributions monotonically decreasing when the\nHiggs is pushed away from the IR brane. We show that the size of the dipole\noperator quickly saturates as the Higgs profile approaches the IR brane,\nimplying small dependence on the precise details of the Higgs profile when it\nis quasi IR localized.

Using a detailed\ncalculation, we confirm the result first written down by Ryskin and Snigirev,\nthat 2v1 graphs in which the two NP ladders do not interact with one another do\ncontribute to the LO proton-proton DPS cross section, albeit with a different\ngeometrical prefactor to the one that applies to the `2v2'/`zero perturbative\nsplitting' graphs. We then show that 2v1 graphs in which the NP ladders\nexchange partons with one another also contribute to the LO proton-proton DPS\ncross section, provided that this `crosstalk' occurs at a lower scale than the\n1->2 branching on the other side of the graph. Due to the preference in the 2v1\ngraphs for the x value at which the branching occurs/crosstalk ceases to be\nmuch larger than x values at the hard scale, the effect of crosstalk\ninteractions is likely to be a decrease in the 2v1 cross section except at very\nsmall x values (< 10^-6). At moderate x values ~10^-3 - 10^-2, the x value at\nthe splitting is in the region ~10^-1 where PDFs do not change much with scale,\nand crosstalk effects are likely to be small. We give an explicit formula for\nthe contribution from the 2v1 graphs to the DPS cross section, and combine this\nwith the suggestion that `double perturbative splitting'/`1v1' graphs should be\nremoved from this cross section made in a previous publication, to obtain a\nformula for the DPS cross section.

The same procedure was\ndone for 1000 Monte Carlo simulations that were produced using the WMAP team\n{\\Lambda}CDM best-fit power spectrum. We also changed the quadrupole and\noctopole amplitudes to fit their observable WMAP values in the {\\Lambda}CDM\nmodel, hereafter M{\\Lambda}CDM. Our analysis showed asymmetries between the\nsoutheastern quadrant (SEQ) and the other quadrants (southwestern quadrant\n(SWQ), northeastern quadrant (NEQ) and northwestern quadrant (NWQ)). Over all\nWMAP maps, the probability for the occurrence of the SEQ-NEQ, SEQ-SWQ and\nSEQ-NWQ asymmetries varies from 0.1% (SEQ-NEQ) to 8.5% (SEQ-SWQ) using the KQ85\nmask and the KQ85 mask + |b|<10 degrees Galactic cut, respectively. We also\ncalculated the probabilities for the M{\\Lambda}CDM, finding no significant\ndifferences in the results. Moreover, the cold spot region was covered with\nmasks of 5,10 and 15 degrees radius and again the results remained unchanged.\nThis analysis was also repeated for random regions in the SEQ quadrant with a\n15-degree mask and the SEQ quadrant still remained asymmetric with respect to\nthe other quadrants of the CMB map. We found an excess of power in the TPCF at\nscales >100 degrees in the SEQ with respect to the other quadrants that is\nindependent of the Galactic cut used, and found no evidence for its possible\nrelation with the cold spot signal. We could not find any specific region\nwithin the SEQ that might be considered responsible for the quadrant asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 19:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

In case of a\nsingle secondary user (SU) in the secondary network, due to the lack of\ninformation of PUs' activities, the SU randomly allocates the subcarriers of\nthe primary network and collide with the PUs' subcarriers with a certain\nprobability. To maintain the quality of service (QoS) requirement of PUs, the\ninterference that SU causes onto PUs is controlled by adjusting SU's transmit\npower below a predefined threshold, referred to as interference temperature. In\nthis work, the average capacity of SU with subcarrier collisions is employed as\nperformance measure to investigate the proposed random allocation scheme for\nboth general and Rayleigh channel fading models. Bounds and scaling laws of\naverage capacity with respect to the number of SU's, PUs' and available\nsubcarriers are derived. In addition, in the presence of multiple SUs, the\nmultiuser diversity gain of SUs assuming an opportunistic scheduling is also\ninvestigated. To avoid the interference at the SUs that might be caused by the\nrandom allocation scheme and obtain the maximum sum rate for SUs based on the\navailable subcarriers, an efficient centralized sequential algorithm based on\nthe opportunistic scheduling and random allocation (utilization) methods is\nproposed to ensure the orthogonality of assigned subcarriers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 19:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

For well-mixed systems where interactions result in\nfitness reductions of the losers exceeding fitness gains of the winners,\nclassical theory predicts that two strategies go extinct. The effects of\nspatial heterogeneity and dispersal rates on this outcome are analyzed using a\ngeneral framework for evolutionary games in patchy landscapes. The analysis\nreveals that coexistence is determined by the rates at which dominant\nstrategies invade a landscape occupied by the subordinate strategy (e.g. rock\ninvades a landscape occupied by scissors) and the rates at which subordinate\nstrategies get excluded in a landscape occupied by the dominant strategy (e.g.\nscissor gets excluded in a landscape occupied by rock). These invasion and\nexclusion rates correspond to eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics near\nsingle strategy equilibria. Coexistence occurs when the product of the invasion\nrates exceeds the product of the exclusion rates.

This\nstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planet\nhost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and\niii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust\nconcentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we\nfind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we\nattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence\nthat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk\npopulation. Higher resolution imaging of stars with excesses is the best way to\nrule out galaxy confusion and identify more reliable disk candidates among\nKepler stars. A similar survey to ours that focusses on nearby stars would be\nwell suited to finding the distribution of rare warm disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 20:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-07"}

In such inverse problems, the functionals dampen or entirely\neliminate some of the signal's interesting features. This makes it difficult or\neven impossible to fully reconstruct the signal, even without noise. In this\npaper, we develop methods for handling sequences of related inverse problems,\nwith the problems varying either systematically or randomly over time.

The interference-limited\nreality in femtocell networks makes interference management (IM) the key to\nmaintaining the quality of service and fairness in femtocell networks.\nOver-the-air signaling is one of the most effective means for fast distributed\ndynamic IM. However, the design of this type of signal is challenging. In this\npaper, we address the challenges and propose an effective solution, referred to\nas single-tone signaling (STS). The proposed STS scheme possesses many highly\ndesirable properties, such as no dedicated resource requirement (no system\noverhead), no near-far effect, no inter-signal interference, and immunity to\nsynchronization error. In addition, the proposed STS signal provides a means\nfor high quality wideband channel estimation for the use of coordinated\ntechniques, such as coordinated beamforming. Based on the proposed STS, two\ndistributed dynamic IM schemes, ON/OFF power control and SLNR\n(signal-to-leakage-plus-noise-ratio)-based transmitter beam coordination, are\nproposed.

Kepler provides the longest continuous timeseries\ncurrently available, which calls for a study of the influence of the increased\ntimespan on the accuracy and precision of the obtained results. We find that in\ngeneral a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary to\nobtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95%\nof the stars, but this does depend on <dnu>. In a statistical sense the quoted\nuncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of the\nobtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to be\noverestimated for results of longer runs. Furthermore, the different\ndefinitions of the global parameters used in the different methods have\nnon-negligible effects on the obtained values. Additionally, we show that there\nis a correlation between nu_max and the flux variance. We conclude that longer\ntimeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes\n(from ~60% in 50 day runs to > 95% in 400 day runs with a slight method\ndependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters.\nThe trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longer\ntimeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the median\nabsolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from\n50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission).

The main goal of this analysis was to study the effect of initial\nhighly-anisotropic stages on the final soft hadronic observables typically\nmeasured in the experiment. The study was done in the context of the heavy-ion\nmeasurements performed at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) in Brookhaven\nNational Laboratory. Starting from the general assumption about the form of the\nphase-space distribution function, thermodynamic properties of locally\nanisotropic systems of particles have been studied and the form of the\ngeneralized equation of state has been formulated. The dynamic equations\ndetermining the evolution of a highly-anisotropic fluid have been introduced.\nThe form of the entropy source related to the mechanisms leading to\nthermalization of the system has been defined. In the simplest case of\npurely-longitudinal and boost-invariant expansion, different features of the\nmodel have been analyzed. Using the ADHYDRO model in the general (3+1)D and\nboost-invariant (2+1)D versions, different possible scenarios of early stages\nof heavy-ion collisions have been analyzed. The results of the ADHYDRO model\nhave been compared to the results obtained from the reference, perfect-fluid\nhydrodynamic model -- LHYQUID. The results of the hydrodynamic models were\ncoupled to the statistical Monte-Carlo model THERMINATOR. The following\nconclusions have been drawn: a) All studied observables are almost insensitive\nto the initial anisotropic stage provided the initial conditions of the\nevolution are properly readjusted, b) Complete thermalization of matter may\ntake place only at the times of about 1 fm/c. In this way the early\nthermalization puzzle may be circumvented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 10:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-04"}

Methods:\nPhotometric, spectroscopic, and interferometric data were analyzed, revealing\nthe basic physical properties of the system 65 UMa. A disentangling technique\nis used to perform the spectra decomposition. This combined approach allows us\nto study the long-term period changes in the system, identifying the period\nvariation due to the motion on the visual orbit, in addition to a short-term\nmodulation. Results: We find that the system contains one more component, hence\n65 UMa is a sextuple hierarchical system. The most inner pair of components\nconsists of an eclipsing binary orbiting around a barycenter on a circular\norbit, both components being almost identical of spectral type about A7. This\npair orbits on an eccentric orbit around a barycenter, and the third component\norbits with a period of about 640 days. This motion is reflected in the period\nvariation in the minima times of the eclipsing pair, as well as in the radial\nvelocities of the primary, secondary, and tertiary components. Moreover, this\nsystem orbits around a barycenter with the distant component resolved\ninterferometrically, whose period is of about 118 years. Two more distant\ncomponents (4\" and 63\") are also probably gravitationally bound to the system.\nThe nodal period of the eclipsing-pair orbit is on the order of only a few\ncenturies, which makes this system even more interesting for a future\nprospective detection of changing the depths of minima. Conclusions: We\nidentify a unique solution of the system 65 UMa, decomposing the individual\ncomponents and even shifting the system to higher multiplicity. The study of\nthis kind of multiple can help us to understand the origin of stellar systems.\nBesides 65 UMa, only another 11 sextuple systems have been studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 12:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-04"}

Multiple antennas use the same hardware to process the radio\nsignal. So only one antenna can transmit or receive at a time as all radio\nsignals need to go through the single RF chain. In MIMO there can be a separate\nRF chain for each antenna allowing multiple RF chains to coexist. MIMO\ntechnology has attracted attention in wireless communications, because it\noffers significant increases in data throughput and link range without\nadditional bandwidth or increased transmit power. It achieves this goal by\nspreading the same total transmit power over the antennas to achieve an array\ngain that improves the spectral efficiency (more bits per second per hertz of\nbandwidth) or to achieve a diversity gain that improves the link reliability.\nMultiple Input/Multiple Output (MIMO) is an area of intense development in the\nwireless industry because it delivers profound gains in range, throughput and\nreliability. As a result, manufacturers of wireless local area network (WLAN),\nwireless metropolitan area network (WMAN), and mobile phone equipment are\nembracing MIMO technology.

These data have been analysed by\nHiemstra et al. (2011) using a variety of phenomenological models. We\nre-examine the spectrum with a self-consistent relativistic reflection model. A\nnarrow absorption line near 7.2 keV may be present, which if real is likely the\nFe XXVI absorption line arising from highly ionised, rapidly outflowing disc\nwind. The blue shift of this feature corresponds to a velocity of about 11100\nkm/s, which is much larger than the typical values seen in stellar-mass black\nholes. Given that we also find the source to have a low inclination (i < 32\ndegrees; close to face-on), we would therefore be seeing through the very base\nof outflow. This could be a possible explanation for the unusually high\nvelocity. We use a reflection model combined with a relativistic convolution\nkernel which allows for both prograde and retrograde black hole spin, and treat\nthe potential absorption feature with a physical model for a photo-ionised\nplasma.

We construct the evolutionary tracks of growing\nplanets at planet traps in evolving protoplanetary disks and show that they\nprovide a good physical understanding of how these observational properties\narise. The fundamental feature of our model is that inhomogeneities in\nprotoplanetary disks give rise to multiple (up to 3) trapping sites for rapid\n(type I) planetary migration of planetary cores. The viscous evolution of disks\nresults in the slow radial movement of the traps and their cores from large to\nsmall orbital periods. In our model, the slow inward motion of planet traps is\ncoupled with the standard core accretion scenario for planetary growth. As\nplanets grow, type II migration takes over. Planet growth and radial movement\nare ultimately stalled by the dispersal of gas disks via photoevaporation. Our\nmodel makes a number of important predictions: that distinct sub-populations of\nplanets that reflect the properties of planet traps where they have grown\nresult in the mass-period relation; that the presence of these sub-populations\nnaturally explains a pile-up of planets at $\\sim 1$ AU; and that evolutionary\ntracks from the ice line do put planets at short periods and fill an earlier\nclaimed \"planet desert\" - sparse population of planets in the mass-semi-major\naxis diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 14:13:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Sep 2012 16:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The integrated Stokes spectra are employed to determine the\nfraction of the field of view covered by linear polarization signals.

In 2008, PHL 1092 was found to be in a remarkably low X-ray\nflux state during an XMM-Newton observation. Its 2 keV flux density had dropped\nby a factor of ~260 with respect to a previous observation performed 4.5 yr\nearlier. The UV flux remained almost constant, resulting in a significant\nsteepening of the optical-to-X-ray slope alpha_ox from -1.57 to -2.51, making\nPHL 1092 one of the most extreme X-ray weak quasars with no observed broad\nabsorption lines (BALs) in the UV. We have monitored the source since 2008 with\nthree further XMM-Newton observations, producing a simultaneous UV and X-ray\ndatabase spanning almost 10 yr in total in the activity of the source. Our\nmonitoring program demonstrates that the alpha_ox variability in PHL 1092 is\nentirely driven by long-term X-ray flux changes. We apply a series of\nphysically-motivated models with the goal of explaining the UV-to-X-ray\nspectral energy distribution (SED) and the extreme X-ray and alpha_ox\nvariability. We consider three possible models: i) A \"breathing corona\"\nscenario in which the size of the X-ray emitting corona is correlated with the\nX-ray flux. In this case, the lowest X-ray flux states of PHL 1092 are\nassociated with an almost complete collapse of the X-ray corona down to the\nmarginal stable orbit; ii) An absorption scenario in which the X-ray flux\nvariability is entirely due to intervening absorption. If so, PHL 1092 is a\nquasar with standard X-ray output for its optical luminosity, appearing as\nX-ray weak at times due to absorption; iii) A disc-reflection-dominated\nscenario in which the X-ray emitting corona is confined within a few\ngravitational radii from the black hole at all times. In this case, the\nintrinsic variability of PHL 1092 only needs to be a factor of ~10 rather than\nthe observed factor of ~260.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 14:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Particularly, present evolutionary optimization\napproaches generally start their search from scratch or the ground-zero state\nof knowledge, independent of how similar the given new problem of interest is\nto those optimized previously. There has thus been the apparent lack of\nautomated knowledge transfers and reuse across problems. Taking the cue, this\npaper introduces a novel Memetic Computational Paradigm for search, one that\nmodels after how human solves problems, and embarks on a study towards\nintelligent evolutionary optimization of problems through the transfers of\nstructured knowledge in the form of memes learned from previous problem-solving\nexperiences, to enhance future evolutionary searches. In particular, the\nproposed memetic search paradigm is composed of four culture-inspired\noperators, namely, Meme Learning, Meme Selection, Meme Variation and Meme\nImitation. The learning operator mines for memes in the form of latent\nstructures derived from past experiences of problem-solving. The selection\noperator identifies the fit memes that replicate and transmit across problems,\nwhile the variation operator introduces innovations into the memes. The\nimitation operator, on the other hand, defines how fit memes assimilate into\nthe search process of newly encountered problems, thus gearing towards\nefficient and effective evolutionary optimization. Finally, comprehensive\nstudies on two widely studied challenging well established NP-hard routing\nproblem domains, particularly, the capacitated vehicle routing (CVR) and\ncapacitated arc routing (CAR), confirm the high efficacy of the proposed\nmemetic computational search paradigm for intelligent evolutionary optimization\nof problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 14:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-04"}

The removal of the infrared divergence in the number\nequations is shown both numerically and analytically, through a study of the\nlong-wavelength and low-energy limit of the pair fluctuation density. Besides\nthe pseudogap temperature, also the pair formation temperature and the critical\ntemperature for superfluidity are derived. The latter corresponds to the\nBerezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. The pseudogap temperature,\nwhich coincides with the pair formation temperature in mean field, is found to\nbe suppressed with respect to the pair formation temperature by fluctuations.\nThis suppression is strongest for large binding energies of the pairs. Finally,\nwe investigate how the pair formation temperature, the pseudogap temperature\nand the BKT temperature behave as a function of both binding energy and\nimbalance between the pairing partners in the Fermi gas.

In this paper, we use the five non-trivial FRW\nmetrics with constant spacetime curvature (i.e., the static FRW metrics, but\nexcluding Minkowski) to prove that in static FRW spacetimes in which expansion\nbegan from an initial signularity, the visible universe today has a proper size\nequal to R_h(t_0/2), i.e., the gravitational horizon at half its current age.\nThe exceptions are de Sitter and Lanczos, whose contents had pre-existing\npositions away from the origin. In so doing, we confirm earlier results showing\nthe same phenomenon in a broad range of cosmologies, including LCDM, based on\nthe numerical integration of null geodesic equations through an FRW metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 08:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 12:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-26"}
