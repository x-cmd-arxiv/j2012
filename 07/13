It is shown that\nspin-orbital entanglement in superexchange models destabilizes the long-range\n(spin and orbital) order and may lead either to a disordered spin-liquid state\nor to novel phases at low temperature which arise from strongly frustrated\ninteractions. Such novel ground states cannot be described within the\nconventionally used mean field theory which separates spin and orbital degrees\nof freedom. Even in cases where the ground states are disentangled,\nspin-orbital entanglement occurs in excited states and may become crucial for a\ncorrect description of physical properties at finite temperature. As an\nimportant example of this behaviour we present spin-orbital entanglement in the\n$R$VO$_3$ perovskites, with $R$=La,Pr,...,Yb,Lu, where such finite temperature\nproperties of these compounds can be understood only using entangled states:\n($i$) thermal evolution of the optical spectral weights, ($ii$) the dependence\nof transition temperatures for the onset of orbital and magnetic order on the\nionic radius in the phase diagram of the $R$VO$_3$ perovskites, and ($iii$)\ndimerization observed in the magnon spectra for the $C$-type antiferromagnetic\nphase of YVO$_3$. Finally, it is shown that joint spin-orbital excitations in\nan ordered phase with coexisting antiferromagnetic and alternating orbital\norder introduces topological constraints for the hole propagation and will thus\nradically modify transport properties in doped Mott insulators where hole\nmotion implies simultaneous spin and orbital excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 16:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-13"}

Here,\ninterference network is referred to as a general single-hop communication\nscenario with arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers, and also\narbitrary distribution of messages among transmitters and receivers. It is\nshown that the information flow in such networks follows similar derivations\nfrom many aspects. This systematic study is launched by considering the basic\nbuilding blocks in Part I. The Multiple Access Channel (MAC), the Broadcast\nChannel (BC), the Classical Interference Channel (CIC) and the Cognitive Radio\nChannel (CRC) are proposed as the main building blocks for all interference\nnetworks. First, a brief review of existing results regarding these basic\nstructures is presented. New observations are also presented in this regard.\nSpecifically, it is shown that the well-known strong interference conditions\nfor the two-user CIC do not change if the inputs are dependent. Next, new\ncapacity outer bounds are established for the basic structures with two\nreceivers. These outer bounds are all derived based on a unified framework. By\nusing the derived outer bounds, some new capacity results are proved for the\nCIC and the CRC; a mixed interference regime is identified for the two-user\ndiscrete CIC where the sum-rate capacity is established. Also, a noisy\ninterference regime is derived for the one-sided discrete CIC. For the CRC, a\nfull characterization of the capacity region for a class of more-capable\nchannels is obtained. Moreover, it is shown that the derived outer bounds are\nuseful to study the channels with one-sided receiver side information wherein\none of the receivers has access to the non-intended message; capacity bounds\nare also discussed in details for such scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 16:51:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 06:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-18"}

Under the canonical assumption that\nthe spectrum of CRs is a power-law in momentum and that the spectrum of\nsecondaries is stationary, we find that the combination of the steep spectrum\nof CRs necessary to explain the spectrum of the halo and their very broad\nspatial distribution (and large energy density) result in a gamma-ray emission\nin excess of present limits, unless the cluster magnetic field is sufficiently\nlarge.

The severity of the latter corresponds to the absence of observed\nasteroids at low eccentricity, e, in both of these mmr and even more so at 2/1.\nChaos at higher e is present but weaker so that real bodies can remain over the\nage of the solar system. This reduced chaos, we suggest, arises because the\ndenser though weaker secondaries have widths that allow them to overlap and so\nprovide a continuous quite constant level of chaos over a broad eccentricity\nrange.

In\nparticular, we can naturally reproduce the bimodal distribution in observed\ncore radii separating the \"core-collapsed\" vs the \"non core-collapsed\"\nclusters. We see that the core-collapsed clusters are those that have reached\nor are about to reach the equilibrium \"binary burning\" phase. The non\ncore-collapsed clusters are still undergoing gravo-thermal contraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 19:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 21:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 21:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

These simple, model-independent strategies\nreduce the set of assumptions to near axisymmetry of the disc and are designed\nfor kinematically hot stars, which are less affected by spiral arms and other\neffects. The first two methods use the position-dependent rotational streaming\nin the heliocentric radial velocities U. The resulting rotation estimate\n{\\theta} from U velocities does not depend on Vg,\\odot. The first approach\ncompares this with rotation from the galactic azimuthal velocities to constrain\nVg,\\odot at an assumed R0. Both Vg,\\odot and R0 can be determined using the\nproper motion of Sgr A\\ast as a second constraint. The second strategy makes\nuse of {\\theta} being roughly proportional to R0. Therefore a wrong R0 can be\ndetected by an unphysical trend of Vg,\\odot with the intrinsic rotation of\ndifferent populations.

The\npredicted primordial 7Li abundance is four times that measured in the\natmospheres of Galactic halo stars. This discrepancy could be caused by\nmodification of surface lithium abundances during the stars' lifetimes or by\nphysics beyond the Standard Model that affects early nucleosynthesis. The\nlithium abundance of low-metallicity gas provides an alternative constraint on\nthe primordial abundance and cosmic evolution of lithium that is not\nsusceptible to the in situ modifications that may affect stellar atmospheres.\nHere we report observations of interstellar 7Li in the low-metallicity gas of\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy with a quarter the Sun's\nmetallicity. The present-day 7Li abundance of the Small Magellanic Cloud is\nnearly equal to the BBN predictions, severely constraining the amount of\npossible subsequent enrichment of the gas by stellar and cosmic-ray\nnucleosynthesis. Our measurements can be reconciled with standard BBN with an\nextremely fine-tuned depletion of stellar Li with metallicity. They are also\nconsistent with non-standard BBN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 16:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 12:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 19:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

A \\textit{maximal\nindependent set (MIS)} is a 1-ruling set. The problem of computing an MIS on a\nnetwork is a fundamental problem in distributed algorithms and the fastest\nalgorithm for this problem is the $O(\\log n)$-round algorithm due to Luby\n(SICOMP 1986) and Alon et al. (J. Algorithms 1986) from more than 25 years ago.\nSince then the problem has resisted all efforts to yield to a sub-logarithmic\nalgorithm. There has been recent progress on this problem, most importantly an\n$O(\\log \\Delta \\cdot \\sqrt{\\log n})$-round algorithm on graphs with $n$\nvertices and maximum degree $\\Delta$, due to Barenboim et al. (Barenboim,\nElkin, Pettie, and Schneider, April 2012, arxiv 1202.1983; to appear FOCS\n2012).\n  We approach the MIS problem from a different angle and ask if O(1)-ruling\nsets can be computed much more efficiently than an MIS? As an answer to this\nquestion, we show how to compute a 2-ruling set of an $n$-vertex graph in\n$O((\\log n)^{3/4})$ rounds. We also show that the above result can be improved\nfor special classes of graphs such as graphs with high girth, trees, and graphs\nof bounded arboricity.\n  Our main technique involves randomized sparsification that rapidly reduces\nthe graph degree while ensuring that every deleted vertex is close to some\nvertex that remains. This technique may have further applications in other\ncontexts, e.g., in designing sub-logarithmic distributed approximation\nalgorithms. Our results raise intriguing questions about how quickly an MIS (or\n1-ruling sets) can be computed, given that 2-ruling sets can be computed in\nsub-logarithmic rounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 21:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-16"}

One is the advection dominated accretion flows\n(ADAFs) which lie on low accretion rate regime, $\\la 10\\alpha^2\\ledd/c^2$;\nanother being the luminous hot accretion flows (LHAFs) which lie above this\naccretion rate. For the latter, we assume that the accretion flow will has a\ntwo-phase structure above a certain accretion rate, and a simplification is\nadopted in our calculation of the dynamics. Our results indicate that the\nradiative efficiency of hot accretion flow increases with the accretion rate\nand is highly enhanced by the direct viscous heating to electrons compared to\nthe previous case of $\\delta\\ll 1$. When the accretion rate is high, the\nradiative efficiency of hot accretion flow is comparable to that of the\nstandard thin disk. Fitting formulae of radiative efficiency as a function of\naccretion rate for various $\\delta$ values are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 22:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 00:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The analytical solution is compared with Monte Carlo\nsimulations and with experimental data, showing overall excellent agreement.\nThe generality of this theoretical framework allows to investigate also the\ncase of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections; in particular, we show that\nreactivation in that context plays a minor role. This may suggest that, while\nthe screening for tuberculous is necessary prior to initiating biologics, when\nconsidering non-tuberculous mycobacteria only a watchful monitoring during the\ntreatment is recommended.

After reducing the problem to a shortest distance\nminimization in a space of bounded linear operators, duality theory is applied\nto show existence of optimal solutions, which satisfy a \"time-varying\" allpass\nor flatness condition. Under mild assumptions the optimal TV controller is\nshown to be essentially unique. Next, the concept of M-ideals of operators is\nused to show that the computation of time-varying (TV) controllers reduces to a\nsearch over compact TV Youla parameters. This involves the norm of a TV compact\nHankel operator defined on the space of causal trace-class 2 operators and its\nmaximal vectors. Moreover, an operator identity to compute the optimal TV Youla\nparameter is provided. These results are generalized to the mixed sensitivity\nproblem for TV systems as well, where it is shown that the optimum is equal to\nthe operator induced of a TV mixed Hankel-Toeplitz. The final outcome of the\napproach developed here is that it leads to two tractable finite dimensional\nconvex optimizations producing estimates to the optimum within desired\ntolerances, and a method to compute optimal time-varying controllers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 23:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-16"}

For conventional axion mass\nwith 10^{-5} eV, the axion reveals a characteristic damping behavior in the\nevolution of density perturbations on scales smaller than the solar system\nsize. The damping scale is inversely proportional to the square-root of the\naxion mass. We show that the axion mass smaller than 10^{-24} eV induces a\nsignificant damping in the baryonic density power spectrum in cosmologically\nrelevant scales, thus deviating from the cold dark matter in the scale smaller\nthan the axion Jeans scale. With such a small mass, however, our basic\nassumption about the coherently oscillating scalar field is broken in the early\nuniverse. This problem is shared by other dark matter models based on the\nBose-Einstein condensate and the ultra-light scalar field. We introduce a\nsimple model to avoid this problem by introducing evolving axion mass in the\nearly universe, and present observational effects of present-day low-mass axion\non the baryon density power spectrum, the cosmic microwave background radiation\n(CMB) temperature power spectrum, and the growth rate of baryon density\nperturbation. In our low-mass axion model we have a characteristic small-scale\ncutoff in the baryon density power spectrum below the axion Jeans scale.

Here the recent\nfinding of patterning consistent with the law of brevity in Formosan macaque\nvocal communication (Semple et al., 2010) is revisited. It is shown that the\nnegative correlation between mean duration and frequency of use in the\nvocalizations of Formosan macaques is not an artifact of the use of a mean\nduration for each call type instead of the customary 'word' length of studies\nof the law in human language. The key point demonstrated is that the total\nduration of calls of a particular type increases with the number of calls of\nthat type. The finding of the law of brevity in the vocalizations of these\nmacaques therefore defies a trivial explanation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 08:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Sep 2012 07:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

This feature occurs naturally when resonant couples undergo dissipation\nthat damps the eccentricities. However, the resonant angles appear to librate\nat the end of the migration process, which is often believed to be an evidence\nthat the systems remain in resonance.\n  Here we provide an analytical model for the dissipation in resonant planetary\nsystems valid for low eccentricities. We confirm that dissipation accounts for\nan excess of pairs that lie just aside from the nominal periods ratios, as\nobserved by the Kepler mission. In addition, by a global analysis of the phase\nspace of the problem, we demonstrate that these final pairs are non-resonant.\nIndeed, the separatrices that exist in the resonant systems disappear with the\ndissipation, and remains only a circulation of the orbits around a single\nelliptical fixed point. Furthermore, the apparent libration of the resonant\nangles can be explained using the classical secular averaging method. We show\nthat this artifact is only due to the severe damping of the amplitudes of the\neigenmodes in the secular motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 08:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 12:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We further\ndevelop the general finite temperature real-time transport formalism by\nintroducing field superoperators that obey fermionic statistics. This direct\nsecond quantization in Liouville-Fock space strongly simplifies the\nconstruction of operators and superoperators which transform irreducibly under\nthe Anderson-model symmetry transformations. The fermionic field superoperators\nnaturally arise from the univalence (fermion-parity) superselection rule for\nthe total system. Expressed in these field superoperators, the causal structure\nof the perturbation theory for the effective time-evolution\nsuperoperator-kernel becomes explicit. The causal structure also implies the\nexistence of a fermion-parity protected eigenvector of the exact Liouvillian,\nexplaining a recently reported result on adiabatic driving [Phys. Rev. B 85,\n075301 (2012)] and generalizing it to arbitrary order in the tunnel coupling.\nFurthermore, in the WBL the causal representation exponentially reduces the\nnumber of diagrams for the time-evolution kernel.

We collected all\npreviously published X-ray eclipse times from 1977 to 2008, to which we added\nthe eclipse time observed by Suzaku in 2006. This point is very important to\ncover the time gap between the last RXTE eclipse time (taken in 2003) and the\nmost recent Chandra eclipse time (taken in 2008).

We compared the X-ray and the optical/UV ephemeris, and finally\nderived a new ephemeris of the source by combining the eclipse arrival times in\nthe X-ray and optical/UV bands. The X-ray eclipse time delays calculated with\nrespect to a constant orbital period model display a clear parabolic trend,\nconfirming that the orbital period of this source constantly increases at a\nrate of $\\dot{P}_{\\rm{orb}} =1.51(7) \\times 10^{-10}$ s/s.

We also\ninvestigate the possible presence of a delay of the optical/UV eclipse with\nrespect to the X-ray eclipse, finding that this delay may not be constant in\ntime. In particular, this variation is compatible with a sinusoidal modulation\nof the optical/UV eclipse arrival times with respect to the long-term parabolic\ntrend. In this case, the optical/UV eclipse should lag the X-ray eclipse and\nthe time-lag oscillate about an average value.

Radial velocities were obtained by\ncross-correlating the observed spectra with those of two template stars. We\nused the relationships available in the literature between the strength of\ninfrared Ca II lines and metallicities to derive the metal content of each\ncluster.

We\ndevelop bounds on the sample-complexity of learning item-clusters from\nprivatized user inputs. Significantly, our results identify a sample-complexity\nseparation between learning in an information-rich and an information-scarce\nregime, thereby highlighting the interaction between privacy and the amount of\ninformation (ratings) available to each user.\n  In the information-rich regime, where each user rates at least a constant\nfraction of items, a spectral clustering approach is shown to achieve a\nsample-complexity lower bound derived from a simple information-theoretic\nargument based on Fano's inequality.

We also outline a bootstrapping approach of using\n\"single-field\" classifiers to noisily label latent variables in a hierarchical\nmodel. Experimental results show that our proposed unsupervised methods perform\nquite competitively even with fully supervised record-linkage methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 19:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}
