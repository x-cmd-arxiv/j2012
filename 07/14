Usually, such studies are based on location data\nobtained from telemetry, and resource selection functions (RSF) are used for\ninference. Another important focus of wildlife research is estimation and\nmodeling population size and density. Recently developed spatial\ncapture-recapture (SCR) models accomplish this objective using individual\nencounter history data with auxiliary spatial information on location of\ncapture. SCR models include encounter probability functions that are\nintuitively related to RSFs, but to date, no one has extended SCR models to\nallow for explicit inference about space usage and resource selection. We\ndevelop a statistical framework for jointly modeling space usage, resource\nselection, and population density by integrating SCR data, such as from camera\ntraps, mist-nets, or conventional catch-traps, with resource selection data\nfrom telemetered individuals. We provide a framework for estimation based on\nmarginal likelihood, wherein we estimate simultaneously the parameters of the\nSCR and RSF models.\n  Our method leads to increases in precision for estimating population density\nand parameters of ordinary SCR models. Importantly, we also find that SCR\nmodels alone can estimate parameters of resource selection functions and, as\nsuch, SCR methods can be used as the sole source for studying space-usage;\nhowever, precision will be higher when telemetry data are available. Finally,\nwe find that SCR models using standard symmetric and stationary encounter\nprobability models produce biased estimates of density when animal space usage\nis related to a landscape covariate. Therefore, it is important that space\nusage be taken into consideration, if possible, in studies focused on\nestimating density using capture-recapture methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 16:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-16"}

Understanding the origin and\nevolution of bilateral organisms requires an understanding of how bilateral\nsymmetry develops, starting from a single cell. Bilateral symmetric growth of a\nmulticellular organism from a single starter cell is explained as resulting\nfrom the opposite handedness and orientation along one axis in two daughter\nfounder cells that are in equivalent developmental control network states.\nSeveral methods of establishing the initial orientation of the daughter cells\n(including oriented cell division and cell signaling) are discussed. The\norientation states of the daughter cells are epigenetically inherited by their\nprogeny. This results in mirror development with the two founding daughter\ncells generating complementary mirror image multicellular morphologies. The end\nproduct is a bilateral symmetric organism. The theory gives a unified\nexplanation of diverse phenomena including symmetry breaking, situs inversus,\ngynandromorphs, inside-out growth, bilaterally symmetric cancers, and the\nrapid, punctuated evolution of bilaterally symmetric organisms in the Cambrian\nExplosion. The theory is supported by experimental results on early embryonic\ndevelopment. The theory makes precise testable predications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 16:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-16"}

Little evidence is found for models that\nassume purely dipolar field geometries; however, strong support is found in the\ndata for a modified version of the X-wind model (Shu et al. 1994) which allows\nfor non-dipolar field geometries. The trapped flux concept in the X-wind model\nis key to making the analytic predictions which appear supported in the data.\nBy extension, our analysis provides support for the outflows predicted by the\nX-wind as these also originate in the trapped flux region. In addition, we find\nno support in the data for accretion powered stellar winds from young stars. By\ncomparing the analysis presented here of NGC 2264 with a similar analysis of\nstars in Taurus (age~1-2 Myr), we find evidence that the equilibrium\ninteraction between the magnetic field and accretion disk in TTS systems\nevolves as the stars grow older, perhaps as the result of evolution of the\nstellar magnetic field geometry.

In addition, we\nuse our accretion parameters to determine the relationship between accretion\nand H-beta luminosity, again finding good agreement with previously published\nresults; however, we also find that care must be used when applying this\nrelationship due to strong chromospheric emission in young stars which can lead\nto erroneous results in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 16:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The combined Suzaku, Swift and INTEGRAL data are represented by an\nabsorbed exponentially cut-off power-law with reflection from neutral material\nwith a photon index Gamma = 1.68+-0.03, a high-energy cut-off Ecut = 227+143-67\nkeV, a reflection component with R = 0.7+-0.3 and a Gaussian component to\naccount for the iron emission-line at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width of EW =\n85+-11 eV. The X-ray spectrum appears dominated by thermal, Seyfert-like\nprocesses, but there are also indications of non-thermal processes. The radio\nto gamma-ray spectral energy distribution can be fit with a single-zone\nsynchrotron-self Compton model, with no need for an additional thermal\ncomponent.

We used morphs between previously learned images to vary\nthe image similarity parametrically, and thereby modulate task difficulty from\nceiling to chance. Over this range we find that rats take more time before\nresponding in trials with more similar stimuli. We conclude that rats'\nperceptual decisions improve with time even in the absence of temporal\ninformation in the stimulus, and that rats modulate speed in response to\ndiscrimination difficulty to balance speed and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 21:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We\nrevisit the commons approach to unlicensed spectrum and try to show that a\ncommons can be basically regulated from the inside out. GT simulations of CR\ninteractions reveal the emergence of certain equilibria mirroring\nbehaviours/trends?. Once these ?trends identified, norms may be expressed and\nthen embedded into machines (CRs). Internalized norms may thus become the\nalternative to external enforcement of rules. We call these emerging norms\ntechno-social norms (TSNs). TSNs could eventually become a means of regulating\nthe use of unlicensed spectrum and making open spectrum access feasible. Open\nspectrum access scenarios are considered and analysis is performed based on\nreformulations of two game theoretical models: Cournot and Bertrand. The\nstandard oligopoly models are reformulated in terms of radio resource access in\nunlicensed bands. In order to capture the large variety of CR interaction\nsituations, several GT equilibrium concepts are considered: Nash, Pareto,\nBerge-Zhukovskii, and Lorenz. In order to capture the heterogeneity of CR\ninteractions, the standard GT model is enriched allowing players to be biased\ntoward different types of equilibrium (or rationality). An evolutionary\ngame-equilibrium detection method is used. Numerical simulations bring relevant\ninsights on the problem of autonomy vs. regulation in emerging CR environments.\nRelying on extensive GT simulations, some rules of behaviour - to be expanded\ninto techno-social norms - may be derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 21:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

VA has been applied to different problems in medical imaging\nsuch as imaging bones, microcalcifications in the breast, mass lesions, and\ncalcified arteries. The obtained images may have a resolution of 0.7--0.8 mm.\nCurrent VA systems based on confocal or linear array transducers generate\nC-scan images at the beam focal plane. Images on the axial plane are also\npossible, however the system resolution along depth worsens when compared to\nthe lateral one. Typical axial resolution is about 1.0 cm. Furthermore, the\nelevation resolution of linear array systems is larger than that in lateral\ndirection. This asymmetry degrades C-scan images obtained using linear arrays.\nThe purpose of this article is to study VA image restoration based on a 3D\npoint spread function (PSF) using classical deconvolution algorithms: Wiener,\nconstrained least-squares (CLSs), and geometric mean filters. To assess the\nfilters' performance, we use an image quality index that accounts for\ncorrelation loss, luminance and contrast distortion. Results for simulated VA\nimages show that the quality index achieved with the Wiener filter is 0.9 (1\nindicates perfect restoration). This filter yielded the best result in\ncomparison with the other ones. Moreover, the deconvolution algorithms were\napplied to an experimental VA image of a phantom composed of three stretched\n0.5 mm wires. Experiments were performed using transducer driven at two\nfrequencies, 3075 kHz and 3125 kHz, which resulted in the difference-frequency\nof 50 kHz. Restorations with the theoretical line spread function (LSF) did not\nrecover sufficient information to identify the wires in the images. However,\nusing an estimated LSF the obtained results displayed enough information to\nspot the wires in the images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 21:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

Tidal disruption of the comet\nnucleus led to a chain of sub-nuclei about 100-1000 m in diameter; these went\non to collide with the planet two years later (Chodas & Yeomans 1996). They\nwere intensively studied prior to and during the collisions, making SL9 the\nbest natural benchmark for physical models of small body disruption. For the\nfirst time in the study of this event, we use numerical codes treating\nrubble-piles as collections of polyhedra (Korycansky & Asphaug 2009). This\nintroduces forces of dilatation and friction, and inelastic response. As in our\nprevious studies (Asphaug & Benz 1994,1996) we conclude that the progenitor\nmust have been a rubble-pile, and we obtain approximately the same pre-breakup\ndiameter (about 1.5 km) in our best fits to the data. We find that the\ninclusion of realistic fragment shapes leads to grain locking and dilatancy, so\nthat even in the absence of friction or other dissipation we find that\ndisruption is overall more difficult than in our spheres-based simulations. We\nconstrain the comet's bulk density at about 300-400 kg/m^3, half that of our\nspheres-based predictions and consistent with recent estimates derived from\nspacecraft observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2012 03:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 04:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 19:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A list of the ballot group identifiers along\nwith number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the\nballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be\nmissing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions\nabout those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of\nmissing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it\nsuffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected\nballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple\nmodification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them\nautomatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors.

This\nensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.\nOn the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on\nthe total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ\nhas no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2012 11:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

On the one side, the Bethe Ansatz is a simple\nproduct state of generalised pair operators. On the other hand, the\nRichardson-Gaudin equations are strongly coupled in a non-linear way, making\nthem prone to singularities. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to give a clear\nphysical interpretation to the Richardson-Gaudin variables because no physical\noperator is directly related to the individual variables. Purpose: The purpose\nof this paper is to shed more light on the critical behavior of the\nRichardson-Gaudin equations, and how this is related to the product wave\nstructure of the Bethe Ansatz. Method: A pseudo-deformation of the quasi-spin\nalgebra is introduced, leading towards a Heisenberg-Weyl algebra in the\ncontraction limit of the deformation parameter. This enables an adiabatic\nconnection of the exact Bethe Ansatz eigenstates with pure bosonic multiphonon\nstates. The physical interpretation of this approach is an adiabatic\nsuppression of the Pauli exclusion principle. Results: The method is applied to\na so-called \"picket-fence\" model for the BCS Hamiltonian, displaying a typical\ncritical behavior in the Richardson-Gaudin variables. It was observed that the\nassociated bosonic multiphonon states change collective nature at the critical\ninteraction strengths of the Richardson-Gaudin equations. Conclusions: The\nPauli exclusion principle is the main responsible for the critical behavior of\nthe Richardson-Gaudin equations, which can be suppressed by means of a pseudo\ndeformation of the quasispin algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2012 12:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-20"}

Kazhdan-Lusztig showed that\ninverting and writing the character of an irreducible highest weight module as\na linear combination of characters of Verma modules, the coefficients in the\nlinear combination are also Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials evaluated at 1, up to a\nsign. In this paper, we show how to prove Kazhdan-Lusztig's character\nmultiplicity inversion formula by induction using coherent continuation\nfunctors. Unitary representations may be identified by determining if\ncharacters and signature characters are the same. The signature character of a\nVerma module may be written as a linear combination of signature characters of\nirreducible highest weight modules where the coefficients in the linear\ncombination are signed Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials evaluated at 1. An analogous\nargument by induction using coherent continuation functors proves an analogous\nmultiplicity inversion formula for signature characters: the signature\ncharacter of an irreducible highest weight module is a linear combination of\nsignature characters of Verma modules where the coefficients, up to a sign, are\nalso signed Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials evaluated at 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2012 13:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

It was later believed that these units\nmay provide a link between quantum theory and gravity in a yet to be developed\ntheory of quantum gravity. I propose a model where the Planck units appear\nnaturally by assuming that the quantum vacuum can be gravitationally polarized\nbased on recent work on the gravitational properties of anti-particles. In\norder to match the observed values, we arrive at Planck particle/anti-particle\npairs (micro black holes) with Planck masses that define the gravitational\nconstant in vacuum through gravitational polarization. This gives the Planck\nmass a new important interpretation as indeed linking quantum fluctuations to\ngravity by defining the gravitational constant. In addition, a better\nunderstanding of why the Planck length is usually associated as the smallest\nlength in nature can be illustrated from another perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2012 12:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
