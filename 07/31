This change in behaviour has been variously\nattributed to either the X-rays switching from being produced in the flow to\nbeing dominated by the jet, or to the flow switching seed photons from the disc\nto self generated seed photons from cyclo-synchrotron. Here we build a simple\ntruncated disc, hot inner flow, plus standard conical synchrotron jet model to\nexplore what this predicts for the X-ray emission mechanism as a function of\nmass accretion rate.\n  We find that the change in X-ray spectral index can be quantitatively (not\njust qualitatively) explained by the seed photon switch in the hot flow i.e.\nthis supports models where the X-rays are always produced by the hot flow. By\ncontrast, standard conical jet models are as radiatively inefficient as the hot\nflow so there is no transition in X-ray production mechanism with $\\dot{m}$.\nIncluding the effects of electron cooling allows the jet X-rays to drop more\nslowly with accretion rate and hence overtake the X-rays from the hot flow,\nhowever this produces a corresponding change in the radio-X-ray correlation,\nwhich is not observed. We argue that the unbroken radio-X-ray correlation down\nto quiescence rules out the jet transition model as an explanation for the\ntrend in X-ray spectral index.\n  Our favoured model is then a truncated disc with an inner, hot, radiatively\ninefficient flow which always dominates the hard X-rays, coupled to a conical\nsynchrotron jet which produces the radio emission. However, even this has\nissues at low $\\dot{m}$ as the low optical depth and high temperature of the\nflow means that the Compton spectrum is not well approximated by a power law.\nThis shows the need for a more sophisticated model for the electron\ndistribution in the hot flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 16:08:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 09:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Since its discovery, the MiMeS Collaboration has\ncontinued to obtain spectroscopic and magnetic observations in order to refine\nour knowledge of its magnetic field strength and geometry, rotational period,\nand spectral properties and variability. In this paper we report new ESPaDOnS\nspectropolarimetric observations of HD 57682, which are combined with\npreviously published ESPaDOnS data and archival H{\\alpha} spectroscopy.

In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the H{\\alpha} equivalent width undergoes a\ndouble-wave variation during a single rotation of the star, consistent with the\nderived magnetic geometry. We group the variable lines into two classes: those\nthat, like H{\\alpha}, exhibit non-sinusoidal variability, often with multiple\nmaxima during the rotation cycle, and those that vary essentially sinusoidally.\nBased on our modelling of the H{\\alpha} emission, we show that the variability\nis consistent with emission being generated from an optically thick, flattened\ndistribution of magnetically-confined plasma that is roughly distributed about\nthe magnetic equator. Finally, we discuss our findings in the magnetospheric\nframework proposed in our earlier study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 16:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The dust temperature is set by radiative equilibrium\nbetween heating by embedded stars and radiation from dust. The gas temperature\nis determined using an energy-rate balance algorithm which includes molecular\ncooling, dust-gas collisional energy transfer, and cosmic-ray ionization. The\nfragmentation proceeds roughly similarly to simulations in which the gas\ntemperature is set to the dust temperature, but there are differences. The\nstructure of regions around sink particles have properties similar to those of\nClass 0 objects, but the infall speeds and mass accretion rates were, on\naverage, higher than those seen for regions forming only low-mass stars. The\ngas and dust temperature have complex distributions not well modeled by\napproximations that ignore the detailed thermal physics. There is no simple\nrelationship between density and kinetic temperature. In particular, high\ndensity regions have a large range of temperatures, determined by their\nlocation relative to heating sources. The total luminosity underestimates the\nstar formation rate at these early stages, before ionizing sources are\nincluded, by an order of magnitude. As predicted in our previous work, a larger\nnumber of intermediate mass objects form when improved thermal physics is\nincluded, but the resulting IMF still has too few low mass stars.

We show that ADBs are closed\nunder union, concatenation and Kleene star, and under intersection with regular\nlanguages, but not closed under complementation and intersection with other ADB\nlanguages. We show that the emptiness and the membership problems are decidable\nin polynomial time for ADBs, whereas the universality problem is undecidable.\nFinally we consider the linear-time model checking problem, i.e., whether the\nlanguage of an ADB is contained in a regular language, and show that the model\nchecking problem is PSPACE-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 18:05:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 17:23:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 22:45:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 16:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

Our approach begins from the response to a uniform external strain\nfield, which is an active time-dependent coordinate transformation in d space\ndimensions. These transformations form the group GL(d,R) of invertible\nmatrices, and the infinitesimal generators are called strain generators. These\nenable us to express the Kubo formula in different ways, related by Ward\nidentities; some of these make contact with the adiabatic transport approach.\nFor Galilean-invariant systems, we derive a relation between the stress\nresponse tensor and the conductivity tensor that is valid at all frequencies\nand in both the presence and absence of a magnetic field. In the presence of a\nmagnetic field and at low frequency, this yields a relation between the Hall\nviscosity, the q^2 part of the Hall conductivity, the inverse compressibility\n(suitably defined), and the diverging part of the shear viscosity (if any);\nthis relation generalizes a result found recently.

We\nexplore the observational consequences of a hypothetical spicule dominated\ncorona and conclude from the large discrepancy between predicted and actual\nobservations that only a small fraction of the hot plasma can be supplied by\nspicules (<2% in active regions, <5% in the quiet Sun, and <8% in coronal\nholes). The red-blue asymmetries of EUV spectral lines and the ratio of lower\ntransition region (LTR; T<0.1 MK) to coronal emission measures are both\npredicted to be 2 orders of magnitude larger than observed. Furthermore, hot\nspicule material would cool dramatically by adiabatic expansion as it rises\ninto the corona, so substantial coronal heating would be needed to maintain the\nhigh temperatures that are seen at all altitudes. We suggest that the corona\ncontains a mixture of thin strands, some of which are populated by spicule\ninjections, but most of which are not. A majority of the observed hot emission\noriginates in non-spicule strands and is explained by traditional coronal\nheating models. However, since these models predict far too little emission\nfrom the LTR, most of this emission comes from the bulk of the spicule material\nthat is only weakly heated and visible in He II (304 A) as it falls back to the\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 19:27:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 20:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 18:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

Further,\nthe computational resources needed for carrying out the data analysis may be\ndistributed across multiple data centers or community resources such as Grids.\nIn this paper, we develop a modeling framework to capture MapReduce execution\nin a highly distributed environment comprising distributed data sources and\ndistributed computational resources.

Evolution of galaxies is affected by the environment in which\nthey reside. Our aim is to study the effects that the local group scale and the\nsupercluster scale environment have on galaxies. We use a luminosity-density\nfield to determine density of the large-scale environment of galaxies in groups\nof various richness. We calculate fractions of different types of galaxies in\ngroups with richnesses up to 50 member galaxies and in different large-scale\nenvironments from voids to superclusters. The fraction of passive elliptical\ngalaxies rises and the fraction of star-forming spiral galaxies declines when\nthe richness of a group of galaxies rises from two to approximately ten\ngalaxies. On the large scale, the passive elliptical galaxies become more\nnumerous than star-forming spirals when the environmental density grows to the\ndensity level typical for superclusters. The large-scale environment affects\nthe level of these fractions in groups: galaxies in equally rich groups are\nmore likely to be elliptical in supercluster environments than in lower\ndensities. The crossing point, where the number of passive and star-forming\ngalaxies is equal, happens in groups with lower richness in superclusters than\nin voids. Galaxies in low-density areas require richer groups to evolve from\nstar-forming to passive. Groups in superclusters are on average more luminous\nthan groups in large-scale environments with lower density. Our results suggest\nthat the evolution of galaxies is affected by both, by the group in which the\ngalaxy resides, and by its large-scale environment.

Nevertheless, we find that\n\\Gamma_{\\phi} is small compared to the rates determined by extrinsic factors in\nmost of the current qubit designs (phase and flux qubits, transmon, fluxonium).\nThe split transmon, in which a single junction is replaced by a SQUID loop,\nrepresents an exception that could make possible the measurement of\n\\Gamma_{\\phi}. Fluctuations of the qubit frequency leading to inhomogeneous\nbroadening may be caused by the fluctuations in the occupation numbers of the\nAndreev states associated with a phase-biased Josephson junction.

An increase in\nslip is observed in comparison to the steady flow for shear rates below the\ncritical shear rate of the corresponding steady flow. This increased slip is\nattributed to fluid inertial forces not represented in a steady flow. An\nunsteady mathematical model for slip is established, which estimates the\nincrement in slip at the boundary. The model shows that slip is also dependent\non acceleration in addition to the shear rate of fluid at the wall. By writing\nacceleration in terms of shear rate, it is shown that slip at the wall in\nunsteady flows is governed by the gradient of shear rate and shear rate of the\nfluid. Non-dimensionalizing the model gives a universal curve which can be used\nto find the slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface based on the\ninformation of shear rate and gradient of shear rate of the fluid. A governing\nnon-dimensional number, defined as the ratio of phase speed to speed of sound,\nis identified to help in explaining the mechanism responsible for the\ntransition of slip boundary condition from finite to a perfect slip and\ndetermining when this would occur. Phase lag in fluid velocity relative to wall\nis observed. The lag increases with decreasing time period of wall oscillation\nand increasing wall hydrophobicity. The phenomenon of hysteresis is seen when\nlooking into the variation of slip velocity as a function of wall velocity and\nslip velocity as a function of fluid shear rate.

Indeed, many of the usual\nconcepts of static graphs have no obvious counterpart in time-varying ones. In\nthis paper, we introduce the notion of temporal reachability graphs.

An edge exists from one node to another in the\nreachability graph at time t if there exists a journey (i.e., a spatiotemporal\npath) in the connectivity graph from the first node to the second, leaving\nafter t, with a positive edge traversal time tau, and arriving within a maximum\ndelay delta. We make three contributions. First, we develop the theoretical\nframework around temporal reachability graphs. Second, we harness our\ntheoretical findings to propose an algorithm for their efficient computation.\nFinally, we demonstrate the analytic power of the temporal reachability graph\nconcept by applying it to synthetic and real-life datasets.

To first order, the torques exerted by the interior and\nexterior disks cancel, analogous to the cancellation of the torques from the\ngravitational interaction with the gas (type I migration). Assuming the\ndispersion-dominated regime and power-laws characterized by indices {\\alpha}\nand {\\beta} for the surface density and eccentricity profiles, we calculate the\nnet torque on the planet. We consider both distant encounters and close\n(orbit-crossing) encounters. We find that the close and distant encounter\ntorques have opposite signs with respect to their {\\alpha} and {\\beta}\ndependences; and that the torque is especially sensitive to the eccentricity\ngradient ({\\beta}). Compared to type-I migration due to excitation of density\nwaves, the planetesimal-driven migration rate is generally lower due to the\nlower surface density of solids in gas-rich disk, although this may be\npartially or fully offset when their eccentricity and inclination are small.\nAllowing for the feedback of the planet on the planetesimal disk through\nviscous stirring, we find that under certain conditions a self-regulated\nmigration scenario emerges, in which the planet migrates at a steady pace that\napproaches the rate corresponding to the one-sided torque. If the local\nplanetesimal disk mass to planet mass ratio is low, however, migration stalls.\nWe quantify the boundaries separating the three migration regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 21:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

It is often assumed\nthat the patches from which halos formed are locally biased with respect to the\ninitial fluctuation field, meaning that the halo-patch fluctuation field can be\nwritten as a Taylor series in that of the dark matter. If quantities other than\nthe local density influence halo formation, then this Lagrangian bias will\ngenerically be nonlocal; the Taylor series must be performed with respect to\nthese other variables as well. We illustrate the effect with Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of a model in which halo formation depends on the local shear (the\nquadrupole of perturbation theory), and provide an analytic model which\nprovides a good description of our results. Our model, which extends the\nexcursion set approach to walks in more than one dimension, works both when\nsteps in the walk are uncorrelated, as well as when there are correlations\nbetween steps. For walks with correlated steps, our model includes two distinct\ntypes of nonlocality: one is due to the fact that the initial density profile\naround a patch which is destined to form a halo must fall sufficiently steeply\naround it -- this introduces k-dependence to even the linear bias factor, but\notherwise only affects the monopole of the clustering signal. The other is due\nto the surrounding shear field; this affects the quadratic and higher order\nbias factors, and introduces an angular dependence to the clustering signal. In\nboth cases, our analysis shows that these nonlocal Lagrangian bias terms can be\nsignificant, particularly for massive halos; they must be accounted for in\nanalyses of higher order clustering such as the halo bispectrum in Lagrangian\nor Eulerian space.

We propose two definitions, selected in part due to their\nsimplicity: they do not require filtration of the fluid phase velocity field,\nnor do they require the construction of conditional averages on particle\nlocations. A key benefit of this simplicity is that the stochastic slip\nvelocity proposed here can be calculated equally well for laboratory, field,\nand numerical experiments. The stochastic slip velocity allows the definition\nof a Reynolds number that should indicate whether large particles in turbulent\nflow behave (a) as passive tracers; (b) as a linear filter of the velocity\nfield; or (c) as a nonlinear filter to the velocity field. We calculate the\nvalue of stochastic slip for ellipsoidal and spherical particles (the size of\nthe Taylor microscale) measured in laboratory homogeneous isotropic turbulence.\nThe resulting Reynolds number is significantly higher than 1 for both particle\nshapes, and velocity statistics show that particle motion is a complex\nnon-linear function of the fluid velocity.

We reconstruct the trigger jet\nusing the FASTJET algorithm, with a E_{T} (p_{T}) cut of 3.0 GeV(/c) on the\ntowers(tracks) in order to reduce the heavy-ion collision background. The\nparticle identification of tracks with p_{T} up to ~ 2.8 GeV/c is obtained by\ntaking advantage of STAR TOF and TPC detectors with full azimuth coverage.\nCorrelations in \\Delta\\phi between jets and identified hadrons are presented,\nand the particle ratios in different regions of azimuth are measured. Particle\nratios associated with the trigger jet vs. the recoil jet, and comparisons to\ninclusive particle ratios can help to distinguish between jet-related (vacuum\nand medium-modified) and bulk-related contributions to the ratios enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 03:52:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Sep 2012 17:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Available measurements suggest that there is isotopic diversity in the\ncomet population. The Herschel Space Observatory revealed an ocean-like ratio\nin the Jupiter-family comet 103P/Hartley 2, whereas most values measured in\nOort-cloud comets are twice as high as the ocean D/H ratio. We present here a\nnew measurement of the D/H ratio in the water of an Oort-cloud comet. HDO,\nH_2O, and H_2^18O lines were observed with high signal-to-noise ratio in comet\nC/2009 P1 (Garradd) using the Herschel HIFI instrument. Spectral maps of two\nwater lines were obtained to constrain the water excitation. The D/H ratio\nderived from the measured H_2^16O and HDO production rates is 2.06+/-0.22 X\n10**-4. This result shows that the D/H in the water of Oort-cloud comets is not\nas high as previously thought, at least for a fraction of the population, hence\nthe paradigm of a single, archetypal D/H ratio for all Oort-cloud comets is no\nlonger tenable. Nevertheless, the value measured in C/2009 P1 (Garradd) is\nsignificantly higher than the Earth's ocean value of 1.558 X 10**-4. The\nmeasured H_2^16O/H_2^18O ratio of 523+/-32 is, however, consistent with the\nterrestrial value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 08:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The origin of this non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic\ninstability lies in the collisional coupling of the neutral particles to the\nmagnetized plasma in the presence of a sheared background flow. Unsurprisingly,\nthe maximum growth rate and most unstable wavenumber depend on the flow\ngradient and ambient diffusivities.\n  The orientation of the magnetic field, velocity shears and perturbation wave\nvector play a crucial role in assisting the instability. When the magnetic\nfield and wave vector are both vertical, ambipolar and Ohm diffusion can be\ncombined as Pedersen diffusion and cause only damping; in this case only Hall\ndrift in tandem with shear flow drives the instability. However, for\nnon-vertical fields and oblique wave vectors, both ambipolar diffusion and Hall\ndrift are destabilizing.\n  We investigate the stability of magnetic elements in the network and\ninternetwork regions.

In this\npaper, we continue the study of set graphs and related topics, focusing on\ncomputational complexity aspects. We prove that set graph recognition is\nNP-complete, even when the input is restricted to bipartite graphs with exactly\ntwo leaves. The problem remains NP-complete if, in addition, we require that\nthe extensional acyclic orientation be also `slim', that is, that the digraph\nobtained by removing any arc from it is not extensional. We also show that the\ncounting variants of the above problems are #P-complete, and prove similar\ncomplexity results for problems related to a generalization of extensional\nacyclic digraphs, the so-called `hyper-extensional digraphs', which were\nproposed by Aczel to describe hypersets.

Here we present some of the most sophisticated\nSMBH feedback simulations to date showing that quasar's effects on galaxies are\nnot always negative. We find that when the ambient shocked gas cools rapidly,\nthe shocked gas is compressed into thin cold dense shells, filaments and\nclumps. Driving these high density features out is much more difficult than\nanalytical models predict since dense filaments are resilient to the feedback.\nHowever, in this regime quasars have another way of affecting the host -- by\ntriggering a massive star formation burst in the cold gas by over-pressurising\nit. Under these conditions SMBHs actually accelerate star formation in the\nhost, having a positive rather than negative effect on their host galaxies. The\nrelationship between SMBH and galaxies is thus even more complex and symbiotic\nthan currently believed. We also suggest that the instabilities found here may\nencourage the chaotic AGN feeding mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 09:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We analyze aspects of the effect of crosstalk in Hebbian learning\nusing the classical Oja model.\n  Methods: In previous work we showed that crosstalk leads to learning of the\nprincipal eigenvector of EC (the input covariance matrix pre-multiplied by an\nerror matrix that describes the crosstalk pattern), and found that with\npositive input correlations increasing crosstalk smoothly degrades performance.\nHowever, the Oja model requires negative input correlations to account for\nbiological ocular segregation. Although this assumption is biologically\nsomewhat implausible, it captures features that are seen in more complex\nmodels. Here, we analyze how crosstalk would affect such segregation.\n  Results: We show that for statistically unbiased inputs crosstalk induces a\nbifurcation from segregating to non-segregating outcomes at a critical value\nwhich depends on correlations. We also investigate the behavior in the vicinity\nof this critical state and for weakly biased inputs.\n  Conclusions: Our results show that crosstalk can induce a bifurcation under\nspecial conditions even in the simplest Hebbian models and that even the low\nlevels of crosstalk observed in the brain could prevent normal development.\nHowever, during learning pairwise input statistics are more complex and\ncrosstalk-induced bifurcations may not occur in the Oja model. Such\nbifurcations would be analogous to \"error catastrophes\" in genetic models, and\nwe argue that they are usually absent for simple linear Hebbian learning\nbecause such learning is only driven by pairwise correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 14:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 04:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-02"}

Methods: The underlying idea is that\nmany iterative algorithms for finding such a solution are perturbation\nresilient in the sense that, even if certain kinds of changes are made at the\nend of each iterative step, the algorithm still produces a\nconstraints-compatible solution. This property is exploited by using permitted\nchanges to steer the algorithm to a solution that is not only\nconstraints-compatible, but is also desirable according to a specified\noptimization criterion. The approach is very general, it is applicable to many\niterative procedures and optimization criteria used in medical physics.\nResults: The main practical contribution is a procedure for automatically\nproducing from any given iterative algorithm its superiorized version, which\nwill supply solutions that are superior according to a given optimization\ncriterion. It is shown that if the original iterative algorithm satisfies\ncertain mathematical conditions, then the output of its superiorized version is\nguaranteed to be as constraints-compatible as the output of the original\nalgorithm, but it is superior to the latter according to the optimization\ncriterion. This intuitive description is made precise in the paper and the\nstated claims are rigorously proved. Superiorization is illustrated on\nsimulated computerized tomography data of a head cross-section and, in spite of\nits generality, superiorization is shown to be competitive to an optimization\nalgorithm that is specifically designed to minimize total variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 05:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For a\nconsistent description of the symmetries of dynamical systems at different\ntimes and the symmetries of the various parts of such systems, we introduce\ndiscrete analogs of the gauge connections. Gauge structures are particularly\nimportant to describe the quantum behavior. We show that quantum behavior is\nthe result of a fundamental inability to trace the identity of\nindistinguishable objects in the process of evolution.

Using\nmathematical arguments of a general nature we can show that any quantum\ndynamics can be reduced to a sequence of permutations.

The observable values can be expressed in terms of\npermutation invariants. We also show that for the description of quantum\nphenomena, instead of a nonconstructive number system --- the field of complex\nnumbers, it is enough to use cyclotomic fields --- the minimal extentions of\nnatural numbers suitable for quantum mechanics.
