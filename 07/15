NMF\nand its extensions minimize either the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the\nEuclidean distance between $X$ and $W^T H$ to model the Poisson noise or the\nGaussian noise. In practice, when the noise distribution is heavy tailed, they\ncannot perform well. This paper presents Manhattan NMF (MahNMF) which minimizes\nthe Manhattan distance between $X$ and $W^T H$ for modeling the heavy tailed\nLaplacian noise. Similar to sparse and low-rank matrix decompositions, MahNMF\nrobustly estimates the low-rank part and the sparse part of a non-negative\nmatrix and thus performs effectively when data are contaminated by outliers. We\nextend MahNMF for various practical applications by developing box-constrained\nMahNMF, manifold regularized MahNMF, group sparse MahNMF, elastic net inducing\nMahNMF, and symmetric MahNMF. The major contribution of this paper lies in two\nfast optimization algorithms for MahNMF and its extensions: the rank-one\nresidual iteration (RRI) method and Nesterov's smoothing method. In particular,\nby approximating the residual matrix by the outer product of one row of W and\none row of $H$ in MahNMF, we develop an RRI method to iteratively update each\nvariable of $W$ and $H$ in a closed form solution. Although RRI is efficient\nfor small scale MahNMF and some of its extensions, it is neither scalable to\nlarge scale matrices nor flexible enough to optimize all MahNMF extensions.\nSince the objective functions of MahNMF and its extensions are neither convex\nnor smooth, we apply Nesterov's smoothing method to recursively optimize one\nfactor matrix with another matrix fixed. By setting the smoothing parameter\ninversely proportional to the iteration number, we improve the approximation\naccuracy iteratively for both MahNMF and its extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2012 16:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-17"}

By using\ntransmission capacity as the performance metric, the number of hopping\nchannels, CPFSK modulation index, and code rate are jointly optimized.

It compares two alternative notions of\nConditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) available in the current literature. These\nnotions are both based on the conditional distribution of a random variable Y\ngiven a stress event for a random variable X, but they use different types of\nstress events. We derive representations of these alternative CoVaR notions in\nterms of copulas, study their general dependence consistency and compare their\nperformance in several stochastic models. Our central finding is that\nconditioning on X>=VaR_\\alpha(X) gives a much better response to dependence\nbetween X and Y than conditioning on X=VaR_\\alpha(X). We prove general results\nthat relate the dependence consistency of CoVaR using conditioning on\nX>=VaR_\\alpha(X) to well established results on concordance ordering of\nmultivariate distributions or their copulas. These results also apply to some\nother systemic risk measures, such as the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and\nthe Systemic Impact Index (SII). We provide counterexamples showing that CoVaR\nbased on the stress event X=VaR_\\alpha(X) is not dependence consistent. In\nparticular, if (X,Y) is bivariate normal, then CoVaR based on X=VaR_\\alpha(X)\nis not an increasing function of the correlation parameter. Similar issues\narise in the bivariate t model and in the model with t margins and a Gumbel\ncopula. In all these cases, CoVaR based on X>=VaR_\\alpha(X) is an increasing\nfunction of the dependence parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jul 2012 22:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 13:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 13:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-30"}

We discuss a number of fundamental questions directly\nrelated to numerical computations of the final state atomic probabilities. A\nfew appropriate variational expansions for atomic wave functions of the\nincident lithium atom and final helium atom and/or tritium negatively charged\nion are discussed. It appears that the final ${}^4$He atom arising during the\nnuclear $(n,{}^{6}$Li; ${}^4$He$,t)$-reaction in the three-electron Li atom can\nalso be created in its triplet states. The formation of the quasi-stable\nthree-electron $e^{-}_3$ during the nuclear $(n; t)-$reaction at the Li atom is\nbriefly discussed. Bremsstrahlung emitted by atomic electrons accelerated by\nthe rapidly moving nuclear fragments from this reaction is analyzed. The\nfrequency spectrum of the emitted radiation is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 01:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2012 15:45:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 00:03:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2012 06:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 00:04:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2013 05:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-17"}

This class includes (among others)\nminimizing the makespan, maximizing the minimum load, and minimizing the l_p\nnorm of the machine loads vector. Previously, this kind of result was only\nknown for the makespan objective. Monotone algorithms have the property that an\nincrease in the speed of a machine cannot decrease the amount of work assigned\nto it. The key idea of our novel method is to show that for goal functions that\nare sufficiently well-behaved functions of the machine loads, it is possible to\ncompute in polynomial time a highly structured nearly optimal schedule.\nMonotone approximation schemes have an important role in the emerging area of\nalgorithmic mechanism design. In the game-theoretical setting of these\nscheduling problems there is a social goal, which is one of the objective\nfunctions that we study. Each machine is controlled by a selfish\nsingle-parameter agent, where its private information is its cost of processing\na unit sized job, which is also the inverse of the speed of its machine. Each\nagent wishes to maximize its own profit, defined as the payment it receives\nfrom the mechanism minus its cost for processing all jobs assigned to it, and\nplaces a bid which corresponds to its private information. For each one of the\nproblems, we show that we can calculate payments that guarantee truthfulness in\nan efficient manner. Thus, there exists a dominant strategy where agents report\ntheir true speeds, and we show the existence of a truthful mechanism which can\nbe implemented in polynomial time, where the social goal is approximated within\na factor of 1+epsilon for every epsilon>0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 15:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}
