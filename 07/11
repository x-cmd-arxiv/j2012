As a\nresult, we find that protected end states in a TI become unstable and decay\nwith time. Very remarkably, the interaction with the thermal environment\n(fermion-boson) respects chiral symmetry, which is the symmetry responsible for\nthe protection (robustness) of the end states in this TI when it is isolated\nfrom the environment. Therefore, this mechanism makes end states unstable while\npreserving their protecting symmetry. Our results have immediate practical\nimplications in recently proposed simulations of TI using cold atoms in optical\nlattices. Accordingly, we have computed lifetimes of topological end states for\nthese physical implementations that are useful to make those experiments\nrealistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 16:43:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 23:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-25"}

For the above applications, our\napproach is based on a refinement of a result, concerning the behavior of\nglobal minimizers of the associated energy over large balls, subject to\nDirichlet conditions. Combining this refinement with global bifurcation theory\nand the sliding method, we can prove uniform estimates for solutions away from\ntheir nodal set. Combining our approach with a-priori estimates that we obtain\nby blow-up, a doubling lemma, and known Liouville type theorems, we can give a\nnew proof of a known Liouville type theorem without using boundary blow-up\nsolutions. We can also provide an alternative proof, and a useful extension, of\na Liouville theorem, involving the presence of an obstacle. Making use of the\nlatter extension, we consider the singular perturbation problem with mixed\nboundary conditions. Moreover, we prove some new one-dimensional symmetry and\nrigidity properties of certain entire solutions to Allen-Cahn type equations,\nas well as in half spaces, convex cylindrical domains. In particular, we\nprovide a new proof of Gibbons' conjecture in two dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 17:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 19:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 12:40:52 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 07:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2014 22:08:48 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 01:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 00:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 18:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 18:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2012 22:29:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 01:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 14:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 10 Sep 2012 16:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 17:50:19 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 20:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

For dwarf galaxies, this process could be\nthe dominant source of halo stars. The effect is caused by stellar\nfeedback-driven bulk motions of dense gas which, by causing potential\nfluctuations in the inner regions of the halo, couple to all collisionless\ncomponents. This effect has been demonstrated to generate cores in otherwise\ncuspy cold dark matter profiles and is particularly effective in dwarf galaxy\nhaloes. It can build a stellar spheroid with larger ages and lower\nmetallicities at greater radii without requiring an outside-in formation model.\nGlobular cluster-type star clusters can be created in the galactic ISM and then\nmigrate to the spheroid on 100\\thinspace Myr timescales.

These priors can\nconveniently be expressed as a maximization over zero-mean Gaussians with\ndifferent variance hyperparameters. Standard MAP estimation (Type I) involves\nmaximizing over both the hyperparameters and coefficients, while an empirical\nBayesian alternative (Type II) first marginalizes the coefficients and then\nmaximizes over the hyperparameters, leading to a tractable posterior\napproximation. The underlying cost functions can be related via a dual-space\nframework from Wipf et al. (2011), which allows both the Type I or Type II\nobjectives to be expressed in either coefficient or hyperparmeter space. This\nperspective is useful because some analyses or extensions are more conducive to\ndevelopment in one space or the other. Herein we consider the estimation of a\ntrade-off parameter balancing sparsity and data fit. As this parameter is\neffectively a variance, natural estimators exist by assessing the problem in\nhyperparameter (variance) space, transitioning natural ideas from Type II to\nsolve what is much less intuitive for Type I. In contrast, for analyses of\nupdate rules and sparsity properties of local and global solutions, as well as\nextensions to more general likelihood models, we can leverage coefficient-space\ntechniques developed for Type I and apply them to Type II. For example, this\nallows us to prove that Type II-inspired techniques can be successful\nrecovering sparse coefficients when unfavorable restricted isometry properties\n(RIP) lead to failure of popular L1 reconstructions. It also facilitates the\nanalysis of Type II when non-Gaussian likelihood models lead to intractable\nintegrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 17:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-11"}

This\nobservation has significant impact on low-energy supersymmetry. First, some\nfine-tuning is necessary to accommodate such a Higgs mass in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) because the tree-level mass of the SM-like\nHiggs boson in the MSSM is relatively small. We study the possibility of\nlifting the mass of the SM-like Higgs boson by non-decoupling D-term from an\nadditional U(1) gauge symmetry. In particular, we focus on a gauged\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry which can also be related to a possible solution of the\nmu problem in the MSSM. In addition to the measurement of the mass of the\nHiggs, the data also reveals a tantalizing hint of a significantly enhanced\ndi-photon signal rate, 1.56 pm 0.43 and 1.9 pm 0.5 times of the SM prediction\nin the CMS and ATLAS experiments, respectively. We demonstrate that such an\nenhancement can be accommodated in this MSSM extension. Anomaly cancellation\nrequires the introduction of charged exotics. If some of them happen to be\nlight and have sizable coupling to the SM-like Higgs boson, the di-photon\nsignal rate can be enhanced significantly. EW precision measurements provide\nstringent constraints on this model. Taking these into account, we identify two\nbenchmark scenarios.

In addition,\nsimultaneous observations of the ONC region including CHS7797 were performed in\nthe I, J, Ks and IRAC [3.6] and [4.5] bands over a time interval of about 40d.\nCHS7797 shows an unusual large-amplitude variation of about 1.7 mag in the R,\nI, and z' bands with a period 17.786. The amplitude of the brightness\nmodulation decreases only slightly at longer wavelengths. The star is faint\nduring 2/3 of the period and the shape of the phased light-curves for seven\ndifferent observing seasons shows minor changes and small-amplitude variations.\nInterestingly, there are no significant colour-flux correlations for\nwavelengths smaller than 2microns, while the object becomes redder when fainter\nat longer wavelengths. CHS7797 has a spectral type of M6 and an estimated mass\nbetween 0.04-0.1Msun. The analysis of the data suggests that the periodic\nvariability of CHS7797 is most probably caused by an orbital motion.\nVariability as a result of rotational brightness modulation by spots is\nexcluded by the lack of any color-brightness correlation in the optical. The\nlatter indicates that CHS7797 is most probably occulted by circumstellar matter\nin which grains have grown from typical 0.1 microns to 1-2 micron sizes. We\ndiscuss two possible scenarios in which CHS7797 is periodically eclipsed by\nstructures in a disc, namely that CHS7797 is a single object with a\ncircumstellar disc, or that CHS7797 is a binary system, similar to KH15D, in\nwhich an inclined circumbinary disc is responsible of the variability. Possible\nreasons for the typical 0.3mag variations in I-band at a given phase are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 21:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The most promising signatures for IMBHs are found in the\ncores of GCs, where the evidence now comes from the stellar velocity\ndistribution, the surface density profile, and, for very deep observations, the\nmass-segregation profile near the cluster center. However, interpretation of\nthe data, and, in particular, constraints on central IMBH masses, require the\nuse of detailed cluster dynamical models. Here we present results from Monte\nCarlo cluster simulations of GCs that harbor IMBHs. As an example of\napplication, we compare velocity dispersion, surface brightness and\nmass-segregation profiles with observations of the GC M10, and constrain the\nmass of a possible central IMBH in this cluster. We find that, although M10\ndoes not seem to possess a cuspy surface density profile, the presence of an\nIMBH with a mass up to 0.75% of the total cluster mass, corresponding to about\n600 Msun, cannot be excluded. This is also in agreement with the surface\nbrightness profile, although we find it to be less constraining, as it is\ndominated by the light of giants, causing it to fluctuate significantly. We\nalso find that the mass-segregation profile cannot be used to discriminate\nbetween models with and without IMBH. The reason is that M10 is not yet\ndynamically evolved enough for the quenching of mass segregation to take\neffect. Finally, detecting a velocity dispersion cusp in clusters with central\ndensities as low as in M10 is extremely challenging, and has to rely on only\n20-40 bright stars. It is only when stars with masses down to 0.3 Msun are\nincluded that the velocity cusp is sampled close enough to the IMBH for a\nsignificant increase above the core velocity dispersion to become detectable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 21:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Workfunction values of some\ncharacteristic surfaces in these emerging semiconducting materials may differ\nby more than $\\approx$ 2 eV as predicted by Density Functional Theory\ncalculations. This large anisotropy is a consequence of the relative\norientation of rod-like [MC$_{2}$]$_{\\infty}$ negatively charged polymeric\nsubunits and the surfaces, with M being a transition metal or metalloid element\nand C$_{2}$ refers to the acetylide ion C$_{2}^{2-}$, with the rods embedded\ninto an alkali cation matrix. It is shown that the conversion of the seasoned\nCs$_{2}$Te photo-emissive material to ternary acetylide Cs$_{2}$TeC$_{2}$\nresults in substantial reduction of its $\\approx$ 3 eV workfunction down to\n1.71-2.44 eV on the Cs$_{2}$TeC$_{2}$(010) surface while its high quantum yield\nis preserved. Similar low workfunction values are predicted for other ternary\nacetylides as well, allowing for a broad range of applications from improved\nelectron- and light-sources to solar cells, field emission displays, detectors\nand scanners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 00:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In network\nengineering, this framework has been particularly insightful towards\nunderstanding how Internet protocols allocate bandwidth, and motivated diverse\nresearch efforts on distributed mechanisms to maximize network utility while\nincorporating new relevant constraints, on energy, power, storage, stability,\netc., e.g., for systems ranging from communication networks to the smart-grid.\nHowever when the available resources and/or users' utilities vary over time,\nreward allocations will tend to vary, which in turn may have a detrimental\nimpact on the users' overall satisfaction or quality of experience.\n  This paper introduces a generalization of NUM framework which explicitly\nincorporates the detrimental impact of temporal variability in a user's\nallocated rewards. It explicitly incorporates tradeoffs amongst the mean and\nvariability in users' reward allocations, as well as fairness.

One challenge in achieving efficient\nbuilding operation is the fact that few financial motivations exist for\nencouraging low energy configuration and operation of buildings. As a result,\nincentive schemes for managers of large buildings are being proposed for the\npurpose of saving energy. This paper focuses on incentive design for the\nconfiguration and operation of building-wide heating, ventilation, and\nair-conditioning (HVAC) systems, because these systems constitute the largest\nportion of energy usage in most buildings. We begin with an empirical model of\na building-wide HVAC system, which describes the tradeoffs between energy\nconsumption, quality of service (as defined by occupant satisfaction), and the\namount of work required for maintenance and configuration. The model has\nsignificant non-convexities, and so we derive some results regarding\nqualitative properties of non-convex optimization problems with certain\npartial-ordering features. These results are used to show that \"baselining\"\nincentive schemes suffer from moral hazard problems, and they also encourage\nenergy reductions at the expense of also decreasing occupant satisfaction. We\npropose an alternative incentive scheme that has the interpretation of a\nperformance-based bonus. A theoretical analysis shows that this encourages\nenergy and monetary savings and modest gains in occupant satisfaction and\nquality of service, which is confirmed by our numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 00:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-12"}

Previous (standard) studies of the anticipated SN\nbirthrate from this channel have assumed that the merger process is\nconservative and that the primary criterion for explosion is that the merged\nmass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. Han & Webbink (1999) demonstrated that\nmass transfer and merger in close double WDs will in many cases be\nnon-conservative. Pakmor et al. (2011) further suggested that the merger\nprocess should be violent in order to initiate an explosion. We have therefore\ninvestigated how the SN Ia birthrate from the double-degenerate (DD) channel is\naffected by these constraints. Using the binary-star population-synthesis\nmethod, we have calculated the DD SN Ia birthrate under conservative and\nnon-conservative approximations, and including lower mass and mass-ratio limits\nindicated by recent smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic calculations. The predicted\nDD SN Ia rate is significantly reduced by all of these constraints. With\ndynamical mass loss alone (violent merger) the birthrate is reduced to 56% of\nthe conservative rate. Requiring that the mass ratio $q>2/3$ further reduces\nthe birthrate to 18% that of the standard assumption.

In this paper, we address successfully a general problem,\nhenceforth called generalized network tomography, wherein the objective is to\nestimate the link performance parameters for networks with arbitrary topologies\nusing only end-to-end measurements of pure unicast probe packets.\nMathematically, given a binary matrix $A,$ we propose a novel algorithm to\nuniquely estimate the distribution of $X,$ a vector of independent non-negative\nrandom variables, given only IID samples of the components of the random vector\n$Y = AX.$ This algorithm, in fact, does not even require any prior knowledge of\nthe unknown distributions. The idea is to approximate the distribution of each\ncomponent of $X$ using linear combinations of known exponential bases and\nestimate the unknown weights. These weights are obtained by solving a set of\npolynomial systems based on the moment generating function of the components of\n$Y.$ For unique identifiability, it is only required that every pair of columns\nof the matrix $A$ be linearly independent, a property that holds true for the\nrouting matrices of all multicast tree networks.

Here, we study, both\nanalytically and numerically, the scaling behavior of the FPT distribution to a\ngiven target node, averaged over all starting nodes. We find that random walks\narrive quickly at a local hub, and therefore, the FPT distribution shows a\ncrossover with respect to time from fast decay behavior (induced from the\nattractive effect to the hub) to slow decay behavior (caused by the exploring\nof the entire system). Moreover, the mean FPT is independent of the degree of\nthe target node in the case of compact exploration.

Using earthquakes as a working example, we show that the energy\nradiated by such events follows a power-law or Pareto distribution. This means,\nin theory, that the expected value of the energy does not exist (is infinite),\nand in practice, that the mean of a finite set of data in not representative of\nthe full population. Also, the distribution presents scale invariance, which\nimplies that it is not possible to define a characteristic scale for the\nenergy. A simple model to account for this peculiar statistics is a branching\nprocess: the activation or slip of a fault segment can trigger other segments\nto slip, with a certain probability, and so on. Although not recognized\ninitially by seismologists, this is a particular case of the stochastic process\nstudied by Galton and Watson one hundred years in advance, in order to model\nthe extinction of (prominent) families. Using the formalism of probability\ngenerating functions we will be able to derive, in an accessible way, the main\nproperties of these models. Remarkably, a power-law distribution of energies is\nonly recovered in a very special case, when the branching process is at the\nonset of attenuation and intensification, i.e., at criticality. In order to\naccount for this fact, we introduce the self-organized critical models, in\nwhich, by means of some feedback mechanism, the critical state becomes an\nattractor in the evolution of such systems. Analogies with statistical physics\nare drawn.

In this paper, we consider the channel training\noptimization problem in EH communication systems, i.e., how to obtain accurate\nchannel state information to improve the communication performance. In contrast\nto conventional communication systems, the optimization of the training power\nand training period in EH communication systems is a coupled problem, which\nmakes such optimization very challenging. We shall formulate the optimal\ntraining design problem for EH communication systems, and propose two solutions\nthat adaptively adjust the training period and power based on either the\ninstantaneous energy profile or the average energy harvesting rate. Numerical\nand simulation results will show that training optimization is important in EH\ncommunication systems. In particular, it will be shown that for short block\nlengths, training optimization is critical. In contrast, for long block\nlengths, the optimal training period is not too sensitive to the value of the\nblock length nor to the energy profile.

Putting the pieces\ntogether of this dynamical behavior is not an easy task and requires a detailed\nunderstanding of the physical processes that control the temporal evolution of\nthe observables. There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that Be\ndisks are well described by standard $\\alpha$-disk theory. This paper is the\nfirst of a series that aims at studying the possibility of inferring several\ndisk and stellar parameters through the follow-up of various observables. Here\nwe study the temporal evolution of the disk density for different dynamical\nscenarios, including the disk build-up as a result of a long and steady mass\ninjection from the star, the disk dissipation that occurs after mass injection\nis turned off, as well as scenarios in which active periods are followed by\nperiods of quiescence.

Magneto-plasmonics, acousto-plasmonics and generation of\nhigh-energy photoelectrons using ultrashort SP pulses represent a few examples\nhow the combination of ideas developed in the individual subfields can be used\nto generate new knowledge suggesting plenty of exciting applications in\nnanophotonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 13:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-08"}

This is already a highly non-trivial statement in the\nspatially homogeneous case. There the Einstein equations reduce to ordinary\ndifferential equations and it becomes a statement that the solutions of the\nEinstein equations can be approximated by heteroclinic chains of the\ncorresponding dynamical system. For a long time progress on proving a statement\nof this kind rigorously was very slow but recently there has been new progress\nin this area, particularly in the case of the vacuum Einstein equations. In\nthis paper we generalize some of these results to the Einstein-Maxwell\nequations. It turns out that this requires new techniques since certain\neigenvalues are in a less favourable configuration in the case with a magnetic\nfield. The difficulties which arise in that case are overcome by using the fact\nthat the dynamical system of interest is of geometrical origin and thus has\nuseful invariant manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 14:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

The five methods are applied to the same CME event, which\noccurred on August 7 2010. Their corresponding results are presented and\ncompared, especially in their propagation direction and spatial extent in 3D.\nWe find that mask fitting and geometric localisation method produce consistent\nresults. Reconstructions including three-view observations are more precise\nthan reconstructions done with only two views. Compared to the forward modeling\nmethod, in which a-priori shape of the CME geometry is assumed, mask fitting\nhas more flexibility. Polarisation ratio method makes use of the Thomson\nscattering geometry. We find spatially the 3D CME derived from mask fitting\nlies mostly in the overlap region obtained with the polarisation method from\nCOR2 A and B. In addition, mask fitting can help resolve the front/back\nambiguity inherent in the polarisation ratio method. However, local correlation\ntracking plus triangulation did not show a consistent result with the other\nfour methods. For reconstructions of a diffuse CME, when the separation angle\nbetween STEREO A and B is large, finding two corresponding points in a STEREO\nimage pair becomes very difficult.

Recently, ULI has been applied\nto the fabrication of astrophotonic devices such as integrated beam combiners,\n3D integrated waveguide fan-outs and multimode-to-single mode convertors\n(photonic lanterns). Here, we outline our work on applying ULI to the\nfabrication of volume phase gratings (VPGs) in fused silica and gallium\nlanthanum sulphide (GLS) glasses. The VPGs we fabricated had a spatial\nfrequency of 333 lines/mm. The optimum fused silica grating was found to\nexhibit a first order diffraction efficiency of 40 % at 633 nm, but exhibited\napproximately 40 % integrated scattered light. The optimum GLS grating was\nfound to exhibit a first order diffraction efficiency of 71 % at 633 nm and\nless than 5 % integrated scattered light. Importantly for future astronomy\napplications, both gratings survived cooling to 20 K. This paper summarises the\ngrating design and ULI manufacturing process, and provides details of the\ndiffraction efficiency performance and blaze curves for the VPGs. In contrast\nto conventional fabrication technologies, ULI can be used to fabricate VPGs in\nalmost any dielectric material, including mid-IR transmitting materials such as\nthe GLS glass used here. Furthermore, ULI potentially provides the freedom to\nproduce complex groove patterns or blazed gratings. For these reasons, we\nbelieve that ULI opens the way towards the development of novel VPGs for future\nastronomy related applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 14:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-09"}

Most\nnotably, recovery of the signal by computationally efficient algorithms is\nguaranteed for certain randomized acquisition systems. However, there is a\ndiscrepancy between the theoretical guarantees and practical applications. In\napplications, including Fourier imaging in various modalities, the measurements\nare acquired by inner products with vectors selected randomly (sampled) from a\nframe. Currently available guarantees are derived using a so-called restricted\nisometry property (RIP), which has only been shown to hold under ideal\nassumptions. For example, the sampling from the frame needs to be independent\nand identically distributed with the uniform distribution, and the frame must\nbe tight.

Existing censorship circumvention systems\nface different difficulties in providing unobservable communication with their\nclients; this limits their availability and poses threats to their users. To\nprovide the required unobservability, several recent circumvention systems\nsuggest modifying Internet routers running outside the censored region to\nintercept and redirect packets to censored destinations. However, these\napproaches require modifications to ISP networks, and hence requires\ncooperation from ISP operators and/or network equipment vendors, presenting a\nsubstantial deployment challenge. In this report we propose a deployable and\nunobservable censorship-resistant infrastructure, called FreeWave. FreeWave\nworks by modulating a client's Internet connections into acoustic signals that\nare carried over VoIP connections. Such VoIP connections are targeted to a\nserver, FreeWave server, that extracts the tunneled traffic of clients and\nproxies them to the uncensored Internet. The use of actual VoIP connections, as\nopposed to traffic morphing, allows FreeWave to relay its VoIP connections\nthrough oblivious VoIP nodes, hence keeping itself unblockable from censors\nthat perform IP address blocking. Also, the use of end-to-end encryption\nprevents censors from identifying FreeWave's VoIP connections using packet\ncontent filtering technologies, like deep-packet inspection. We prototype the\ndesigned FreeWave system over the popular VoIP system of Skype. We show that\nFreeWave is able to reliably achieve communication bandwidths that are\nsufficient for web browsing, even when clients are far distanced from the\nFreeWave server.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 15:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 02:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

We present an approximate algorithm for deciding whether a network\nis monotone in distribution and illustrate its application to a real-life\nnetwork in oncology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 15:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}
