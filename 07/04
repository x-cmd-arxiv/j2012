The laboratory spectra were analyzed with the support of\nsimulations based on the density functional theory. For each PAH molecule,\neight IR spectra were computed by combining the B3LYP functional with as many\ndifferent basis sets, namely 4-31G, 4-31G(d), 6-31G, 6-311G, 6-31G(d),\n6-31G(d,p), 6-31+G(d,p), and 6-31++G(d,p).

It was concluded from the examples of 2- and 9-VA that the\noptimum basis set is 6-31G unless a steric interaction has to be taken into\naccount, in which case the optimum basis set is 6-31G(d). Thus, in the presence\nof such an interaction, the use of d-type polarization functions is\nrecommended.

We have considered these problems in theory and practice and\nreached the following conclusion; in order to build an ideal system for\nautonomic communication, there are three key problems to be solved. Motivated\nby the need for AC, we have designed an efficient and low-cost Peer-to-Peer\n(P2P) overlay called Maya-Pyramid overlay (MPO) and combined merits of\nunstructured P2P with those of structured P2P overlays. Differing from the\ntraditional hierarchical P2P (i.e. tree-like structure) overlay, (1) MPO is\ncomposed of levels and layers, which uses small world characteristic to improve\nefficiency, and the maintenance cost is decreased because update and backup\nonly take place in two neighboring levels or layers instead of recursively\nperform in higher levels. (2) Unlike normal redundant mechanisms for solving\nthe single fault problem: Tri-Information Center (Tri-IC) mechanism is\npresented in order to improve robustness by alleviating the load of cluster\nheads in a hierarchical P2P overlay. (3) A source ranking mechanism is proposed\nin order to discourage free riding and whitewashing and to encourage frequent\ninformation exchanges between peers. (4) Inspired by Pastry's ID structure for\na structured DHT algorithm, a 3D unique ID structure is presented in the\nunstructured P2P overlay. This will guarantee anonymity in routing, and will\nbe, not only more efficient because it applies the DHT-like routing algorithm\nin the unstructured P2P overlay, but also more adaptive to suit AC. Evaluation\nproved that MPO is robust, highly efficient and of a low-cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 17:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-04"}

In order to handle the very large number of planetesimals required\nby planet formation simulations, we introduce the concept of a `tracer'\nparticle.

It is a functional that captures the notions of order/disorder\nand of distance to an equilibrium distribution. The former is computed by a\nmeasure of entropy, while the latter depends on the definition of a stochastic\ndivergence. When the scene is illuminated by coherent radiation, image data is\ncorrupted by speckle noise, as is the case of ultrasound-B, sonar, laser and\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In the amplitude and intensity formats,\nthis noise is multiplicative and non-Gaussian requiring, thus, specialized\ntechniques for image processing and understanding. One of the most successful\nfamily of models for describing these images is the Multiplicative Model which\nleads, among other probability distributions, to the G0 law. This distribution\nhas been validated in the literature as an expressive and tractable model,\ndeserving the \"universal\" denomination for its ability to describe most types\nof targets. In order to compute the statistical complexity of a site in an\nimage corrupted by speckle noise, we assume that the equilibrium distribution\nis that of fully developed speckle, namely the Gamma law in intensity format,\nwhich appears in areas with little or no texture.

BaSnO3 is a semiconducting oxide with a large band\ngap of more than 3.1 eV. Recently, we discovered that La doped BaSnO3 exhibits\nunusually high electrical mobility of 320 cm^2(Vs)^-1 at room temperature and\nsuperior thermal stability at high temperatures [H. J. Kim et al. Appl. Phys.\nExpress. 5, 061102 (2012)]. Following that work, we report various physical\nproperties of (Ba,La)SnO3 single crystals and films including\ntemperature-dependent transport and phonon properties, optical properties and\nfirst-principles calculations. We find that almost doping-independent mobility\nof 200-300 cm^2(Vs)^-1 is realized in the single crystals in a broad doping\nrange from 1.0x10^19 to 4.0x10^20 cm^-3. Moreover, the conductivity of ~10^4\nohm^-1cm^-1 reached at the latter carrier density is comparable to the highest\nvalue. We attribute the high mobility to several physical properties of\n(Ba,La)SnO3: a small effective mass coming from the ideal Sn-O-Sn bonding,\nsmall disorder effects due to the doping away from the SnO2 conduction channel,\nand reduced carrier scattering due to the high dielectric constant. The\nobservation of a reduced mobility of ~70 cm^2(Vs)^-1 in the film is mainly\nattributed to additional carrier-scatterings which are presumably created by\nthe lattice mismatch between the substrate SrTiO3 and (Ba,La)SnO3. The main\noptical gap of (Ba,La)SnO3 single crystals remained at about 3.33 eV and the\nin-gap states only slightly increased, thus maintaining optical transparency in\nthe visible region. Based on these, we suggest that the doped BaSnO3 system\nholds great potential for realizing all perovskite-based, transparent\nhigh-frequency high-power functional devices as well as highly mobile\ntwo-dimensional electron gas via interface control of heterostructured films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 17:46:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 15:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

We argue that the clouds may\nbe gravitationally bound to the supermassive black hole. If true, stabilisation\nby thermal pressure alone becomes even more difficult. We further argue that if\nmagnetic fields should be present in such clouds at a level that could affect\nthe stability properties, they need to be strong enough to compete with the\nradiation pressure on the cloud. This would imply magnetic field values of a\nfew Gauss for a sample of Active Galactic Nuclei we draw from the literature.\nWe then investigate the effect of several magnetic configurations on cloud\nstability in axi-symmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations. For a purely\nazimuthal magnetic field which provides the dominant pressure support, the\ncloud first gets compressed by the opposing radiative and gravitational forces.\nThe pressure inside the cloud then increases, and it expands vertically.\nKelvin-Helmholtz and column density instability lead to a filamentary\nfragmentation of the cloud. This radiative dispersion continues until the cloud\nis shredded down to the resolution level. For a helical magnetic field\nconfiguration, a much more stable cloud core survives with a stationary density\nhistogram which takes the form of a power law.

Usually, the word extreme refers directly to\ncluster mass, which is not a direct observable and thus subject to substantial\nuncertainty. Hence, it is desirable to extend studies of extreme clusters to\ndirect observables, such as the Einstein radius (ER). We aim to evaluate the\noccurrence probability of the large observed ER of MACS J0717.5 within the\nstandard LCDM cosmology. In particular, we want to model the distribution\nfunction of the single largest ER in a given cosmological volume and to study\nwhich underlying assumptions and effects have the strongest impact on the\nresults. We obtain this distribution by a Monte Carlo approach, based on the\nsemi-analytic modelling of the halo population on the past lightcone. After\nsampling the distribution, we fit the results with the general extreme value\n(GEV) distribution which we use for the subsequent analysis. We find that the\ndistribution of the maximum ER is particularly sensitive to the precise choice\nof the halo mass function, lens triaxiality, the inner slope of the halo\ndensity profile and the mass-concentration relation. Using the distributions so\nobtained,we study the occurrence probability of the large ER of MACS J0717.5,\nfinding that this system is not in tension with LCDM. We also find that the GEV\ndistribution can be used to fit very accurately the sampled distributions and\nthat all of them can be described by a Frechet distribution. With a multitude\nof effects that strongly influence the distribution of the single largest ER,\nit is more than doubtful that the standard LCDM cosmology can be ruled out on\nthe basis of a single observation.

Hints of such behavior has been seen in the measurements in\nseveral experiments.

A crucial part of the extended model was the calculation of the\nquark spin flip probability after each hadron emission in the jet.

A subset of 105 observations selected to\nminimize lunar and thermal effects gives a continuous, median spectrum from\n0.83 to 2.5 microns which we present in electronic form. The data are used to\ncharacterize the broadband continuum emission between atmospheric OH features\nand correlate its properties with observing conditions such as lunar angle and\ntime of night. We find that the moon contributes significantly to the\ninter-line continuum in the Y and J bands whereas the observed H band continuum\nis dominated by the blended Lorentzian wings of multiple OH line profiles even\nat R=6000. Lunar effects may be mitigated in Y and J through careful scheduling\nof observations, but the most ambitious near-IR programs will benefit from\nallocation during dark observing time if those observations are not limited by\nread noise. In Y and J our measured continuum exceeds space-based average\nestimates of the Zodiacal light, but it is not readily identified with known\nterrestrial foregrounds. If further measurements confirm such a fundamental\nbackground, it would impact requirements for OH-suppressed instruments\noperating in this regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 20:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 20:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The study is part of an extensive\nXMM-Newton monitoring consisting of 10 pointings (~60 ks each) about once every\nfour days, and includes also a reanalysis of previous XMM-Newton and Chandra\nobservations. Mrk 509 shows a clear (EW=58 eV) neutral Fe Kalpha emission line\nthat can be decomposed into a narrow (sigma=0.027 keV) component (found in the\nChandra HETG data) plus a resolved (sigma=0.22 keV) component. We find the\nfirst successful measurement of a linear correlation between the intensity of\nthe resolved line component and the 3-10 keV flux variations on time-scales of\nyears down to a few days. The Fe Kalpha reverberates the hard X-ray continuum\nwithout any measurable lag, suggesting that the region producing the resolved\nFe Kalpha component is located within a few light days-week (r<~10^3 rg) from\nthe Black Hole (BH). The lack of a redshifted wing in the line poses a lower\nlimit of >40 rg for its distance from the BH. The Fe Kalpha could thus be\nemitted from the inner regions of the BLR, i.e. within the ~80 light days\nindicated by the Hbeta line measurements. In addition to these two neutral Fe\nKalpha components, we confirm the detection of weak (EW~8-20 eV) ionised Fe K\nemission. This ionised line can be modeled with either a blend of two narrow\nFeXXV and FeXXVI emission lines or with a single relativistic line produced, in\nan ionised disc, down to a few rg from the BH. Finally, we observe a\nweakening/disappearing of the medium and high velocity high ionisation Fe K\nwind features found in previous XMM-Newton observations. This campaign has made\npossible the first reverberation measurement of the resolved component of the\nFe Kalpha line, from which we can infer a location for the bulk of its emission\nat a distance of r~40-1000 rg from the BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jul 2012 20:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Such games are a commonly used model in many formal methods, as they\nmake the interaction of a system with its environment explicit. Often, a\nwinning strategy for one of the players is used as a certificate or as an\nartefact for further processing in the application. Small such certificates,\ni.e., strategies that can be written down very compactly, are typically\npreferred. For safety games, we only need to consider positional strategies.\nThese map game positions of a player onto a move that is to be taken by the\nplayer whenever the play enters that position. For representing positional\nstrategies compactly, a common goal is to minimize the number of positions for\nwhich a winning player's move needs to be defined such that the game is still\nwon by the same player, without visiting a position with an undefined next\nmove. We call winning strategies in which the next move is defined for few of\nthe player's positions sparse.\n  Unfortunately, even roughly approximating the density of the sparsest\nstrategy for a safety game has been shown to be NP-hard. Thus, to obtain sparse\nstrategies in practice, one either has to apply some heuristics, or use some\nexhaustive search technique, like ILP (integer linear programming) solving. In\nthis paper, we perform a comparative study of currently available methods to\nobtain sparse winning strategies for the safety player in safety games. We\nconsider techniques from common knowledge, such as using ILP or SAT\n(satisfiability) solving, and a novel technique based on iterative linear\nprogramming. The results of this paper tell us if current techniques are\nalready scalable enough for practical use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 01:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-05"}

Due to the increase in the\npoloidal momentum of the wave as it propagates into the tokamak, the parallel\nmomentum of the wave increases considerably. The change of the perpendicular\nmomentum of the wave is such that the toroidal angular momentum of the wave is\nconserved. If the perpendicular momentum transfer via electron Landau damping\nis ignored, the transfer of the toroidal angular momentum to the plasma will be\nlarger than the injected toroidal angular momentum. A proper quasilinear\ntreatment proves that both perpendicular and parallel momentum are transferred\nto the electrons. The toroidal angular momentum of the electrons is then\ntransferred to the ions via different mechanisms for the parallel and\nperpendicular momentum. The perpendicular momentum is transferred to ions\nthrough an outward radial electron pinch, while the parallel momentum is\ntransferred through collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 02:29:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 18:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Through\nanalyzing the distributions of the physical parameters, we suggest turbulent\nflows can shape the clump structure and dominate their density distribution in\nlarge scale, but not affect in small scale due to the local fluctuations.\nEighty two dense cores are identified in the molecular clumps.

The relationship between $M_{vir}$ and $M_{LTE}$ can be well fitted\nwith a power law. The core mass function here is much more flatten than the\nstellar initial mass function.

We\nuse this well known quantity to show that a gravitational potential energy can\nbe consistently defined. As examples, we study the case of the exterior regions\nof an asymptotically flat black hole and of the $\\Lambda>0$ Schwarzschild de\nSitter case, where an asymptotic region is not available. We then consider the\nsituation in which the test particle is absorbed by the black hole, and analyze\nthe energetics in detail. In particular, we show that the notion of horizon\nenergy as defined by the isolated horizons formalism provides a satisfactory\nnotion of energy compatible with the particle's total conserved energy. With\nthese choices, there is a global conservation of energy. Finally, we comment on\na recent proposal to define energy of the black hole as seen by a nearby\nobserver at rest, for which this feature is lost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 03:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 18:09:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2015 19:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

It follows from the law of large numbers that a plurality vote among the\nn individuals would result in the correct outcome, with probability approaching\none exponentially quickly as n tends to infinity. Our interest in this paper is\nin a variant of the process above where, after forming their initial opinions,\nthe voters update their decisions based on some interaction with their\nneighbors in a social network. Our main example is \"majority dynamics\", in\nwhich each voter adopts the most popular opinion among its friends. The\ninteraction repeats for some number of rounds and is then followed by a\npopulation-wide plurality vote.\n  The question we tackle is that of \"efficient aggregation of information\": in\nwhich cases is the better alternative chosen with probability approaching one\nas n tends to infinity? Conversely, for which sequences of growing graphs does\naggregation fail, so that the wrong alternative gets chosen with probability\nbounded away from zero? We construct a family of examples in which interaction\nprevents efficient aggregation of information, and give a condition on the\nsocial network which ensures that aggregation occurs. For the case of majority\ndynamics we also investigate the question of unanimity in the limit. In\nparticular, if the voters' social network is an expander graph, we show that if\nthe initial population is sufficiently biased towards a particular alternative\nthen that alternative will eventually become the unanimous preference of the\nentire population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 04:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

The important applications of the influence analysis in social network\ninclude influence maximization for viral marketing, finding the most\ninfluential nodes, online advertising, etc. For many of these applications, it\nis crucial to evaluate the influenceability of a node. In this paper, we study\nthe problem of evaluating influenceability of nodes in social network based on\nthe widely used influence spread model, namely, the independent cascade model.\nSince this problem is #P-complete, most existing work is based on Naive\nMonte-Carlo (\\nmc) sampling. However, the \\nmc estimator typically results in a\nlarge variance, which significantly reduces its effectiveness. To overcome this\nproblem, we propose two families of new estimators based on the idea of\nstratified sampling. We first present two basic stratified sampling (\\bss)\nestimators, namely \\bssi estimator and \\bssii estimator, which partition the\nentire population into $2^r$ and $r+1$ strata by choosing $r$ edges\nrespectively. Second, to further reduce the variance, we find that both \\bssi\nand \\bssii estimators can be recursively performed on each stratum, thus we\npropose two recursive stratified sampling (\\rss) estimators, namely \\rssi\nestimator and \\rssii estimator. Theoretically, all of our estimators are shown\nto be unbiased and their variances are significantly smaller than the variance\nof the \\nmc estimator. Finally, our extensive experimental results on both\nsynthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our new\nestimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 06:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-05"}

Based on the susceptible-infected model in contact process,\nwe study numerically how weak ties influence the predictability of epidemic\ndynamics. We first investigate the effects of different kinds of weak ties on\nthe variabilities of both the arrival time and the prevalence of disease, and\nfind that the bridgeness with small degree can enhance the predictability of\nepidemic spreading. Once weak ties are settled, compared with the variability\nof arrival time, the variability of prevalence displays a diametrically opposed\nchanging trend with both the distance of the initial seed to the bridgeness and\nthe degree of the initial seed. More specifically, the further distance and the\nlarger degree of the initial seed can induce the better predictability of\narrival time and the worse predictability of prevalence. Moreover, we discuss\nthe effects of weak tie number on the epidemic variability. As community\nstrength becomes very strong, which is caused by the decrease of weak tie\nnumber, the epidemic variability will change dramatically. Compared with the\ncase of hub seed and random seed, the bridgenss seed can result in the worst\npredictability of arrival time and the best predictability of prevalence. These\nresults show that the variability of arrival time always marks a complete\nreversal trend of that of prevalence, which implies it is impossible to predict\nepidemic spreading in the early stage of outbreaks accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 09:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-05"}

In particular, we show that for instances with n \\geq 5 agents, any such\nmechanism either admits a unique dictator, or always places the facilities at\nthe leftmost and the rightmost location of the instance. As a corollary, we\nobtain that the best approximation ratio achievable by deterministic\nstrategyproof mechanisms for the problem of locating 2 facilities on the line\nto minimize the total connection cost is precisely n-2. Another rather\nsurprising consequence is that the Two-Extremes mechanism of (Procaccia and\nTennenholtz, EC 2009) is the only deterministic anonymous strategyproof\nmechanism with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location on the\nline.\n  The proof of the characterization employs several new ideas and technical\ntools, which provide new insights into the behavior of deterministic\nstrategyproof mechanisms for K-Facility Location games, and may be of\nindependent interest.

The proof uses universal digraph\ncombinatorics, including an acyclic version of the countable random digraph,\nwhich I call the countable random Q-graded digraph, and higher analogues\narising as uncountable Fraisse limits, leading to the hypnagogic digraph, a\nset-homogeneous, class-universal, surreal-numbers-graded acyclic class digraph,\nclosely connected with the surreal numbers. The proof shows that $L^M$ contains\na submodel that is a universal acyclic digraph of rank $Ord^M$. The method of\nproof also establishes that the countable models of set theory are linearly\npre-ordered by embeddability: for any two countable models of set theory, one\nof them is isomorphic to a submodel of the other. Indeed, they are\npre-well-ordered by embedability in order-type exactly $\\omega_1+1$.\nSpecifically, the countable well-founded models are ordered by embeddability in\naccordance with the heights of their ordinals; every shorter model embeds into\nevery taller model; every model of set theory $M$ is universal for all\ncountable well-founded binary relations of rank at most $Ord^M$; and every\nill-founded model of set theory is universal for all countable acyclic binary\nrelations. Finally, strengthening a classical theorem of Ressayre, the same\nproof method shows that if $M$ is any nonstandard model of PA, then every\ncountable model of set theory---in particular, every model of ZFC---is\nisomorphic to a submodel of the hereditarily finite sets $HF^M$ of $M$.

The\npresence of a massive cluster (MS1054-03) in the FIRES field, and of\nsignificant large scale structure in the CDFS field, allows us to study the\nenvironmental dependence of SFRs amongst this population of low-mass galaxies.\nComparing our results with more massive galaxies at this epoch, with our\nprevious survey (ROLES) at the higher redshift z=1, and with SDSS Stripe 82\ndata, we find no significant evolution of the stellar mass function of\nstar-forming galaxies between z=0 and z=1, and no evidence that its shape\ndepends on environment. The correlation between specific star formation rate\n(sSFR) and stellar mass at z=0.75 has a power-law slope of beta=-0.2, with\nevidence for a steeper relation at the lowest masses. The normalization of this\ncorrelation lies as expected between that corresponding to z=1 and the present\nday. The global SFR density is consistent with an evolution of the form (1+z)^2\nover 0<z<1, with no evidence for a dependence on stellar mass. The sSFR of\nthese star-forming galaxies at z=0.75 does not depend upon the density of their\nlocal environment. Considering just high-density environments, the low-mass end\nof the sSFR-M* relation in our data is steeper than that in Stripe 82 at z=0,\nand shallower than that measured by ROLES at z=1. Evolution of low-mass\ngalaxies in dense environments appears to be more rapid than in the general\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 13:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A crucial question is, if for such a Higgs mass value, one could\nextrapolate the model up to high scales while keeping the minimum of the scalar\npotential that breaks the electroweak symmetry stable. Vacuum stability\nrequires indeed the Higgs boson mass to be $M_H \\gsim 129 \\pm 1$ GeV, but the\nprecise value depends critically on the input top quark pole mass which is\nusually taken to be the one measured at the Tevatron, $m_t^{\\rm exp}=173.2 \\pm\n0.9$ GeV.

The\nmost commonly used mechanisms either break Lorentz-invariance explicitly or\ndeform it at high energies. However, the former option is very tightly\nconstrained by experiment already, the latter generically leads to problems\nwith locality. We show here that there exists a third way to integrate\ndeviations from Lorentz-invariance into quantum field theory that circumvents\nthe problems of the other approaches. The way this is achieved is an extension\nof the standard model in which photons can have different speeds without\nsingling out a preferred restframe, but only as long as they are in a quantum\nsuperposition. Once a measurement has been made, observables are subject to the\nlaws of special relativity, and the process of measurement introduces a\npreferred frame. The speed of light can take on different values, both\nsuperluminal and subluminal (with respect to the usual value of the speed of\nlight), without the need for Lorentz-invariance violating operators and without\ntachyons.

We explain this\nuniversal fragmentation dynamics analytically based on the Bose-Hubbard model.\nWe thereby show that the extent to which many-body effects become important at\nlater times depends crucially on the initial state. Even for arbitrarily large\nparticle numbers and arbitrarily weak interaction strength the dynamics is\nmany-body in nature and the fragmentation universal. There is no weakly\ninteracting limit where the Gross-Piatevskii mean-field is valid for long\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 15:02:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jul 2012 08:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 02:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 18:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 19:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

The best fit eccentricity from this solution\nis 0.09+0.25-0.09, and we find agreement for this data set using a Bayesian\nanalysis and a periodogram analysis. We measure a metallicity for the star of\n+0.35\\pm0.06 dex, whereas another recent work (Trevisan et al. 2011) finds\n+0.47\\pm0.05 dex. Thus HD77338b is one of the most metal-rich planet host stars\nknown and the most metal-rich star hosting a sub-Neptune mass planet. We\nsearched for a transit signature of HD77338b but none was detected. We also\nhighlight an emerging trend where metallicity and mass seem to correlate at\nvery low masses, a discovery that would be in agreement with the core accretion\nmodel of planet formation. The trend appears to show that for Neptune-mass\nplanets and below, higher masses are preferred when the host star is more\nmetal-rich. Also a lower boundary is apparent in the super metal-rich regime\nwhere there are no very low-mass planets yet discovered in comparison to the\nsub-solar metallicity regime. A Monte Carlo analysis shows that this, low-mass\nplanet desert, is statistically significant with the current sample of 36\nplanets at around the 4.5\\sigma\\ level. In addition, results from Kepler\nstrengthen the claim for this paucity of the lowest-mass planets in super\nmetal-rich systems. Finally, this discovery adds to the growing population of\nlow-mass planets around low-mass and metal-rich stars and shows that very\nlow-mass planets can now be discovered with a relatively small number of data\npoints using stable instrumentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 15:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 18:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Aims: We\ninvestigate how these observed splittings can constrain the modelling of the\nphysical processes transporting angular momentum in stellar interiors. Methods:\nWe first compare models including a comprehensive treatment of shellular\nrotation only, with the rotational splittings observed for the red giant KIC\n8366239. We then study how these asteroseismic constraints can give us\ninformation about the efficiency of an additional mechanism for the internal\ntransport of angular momentum. This is done by computing rotating models of KIC\n8366239 that include a constant viscosity corresponding to this physical\nprocess, in addition to the treatment of shellular rotation. Results: We find\nthat models of red giant stars including shellular rotation only predict steep\nrotation profiles, which are incompatible with the measurements of rotational\nsplittings in the red giant KIC 8366239. Meridional circulation and shear\nmixing alone are found to produce an insufficient internal coupling so that an\nadditional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum is needed\nduring the post-main sequence evolution. We show that the viscosity nu_add\ncorresponding to this mechanism is strongly constrained to be nu_add=3x10^4\ncm^2 s^-1 thanks to the observed ratio of the splittings for modes in the wings\nto those at the centre of the dipole forests. Such a value of viscosity may\nsuggest that the same unknown physical process is at work during the main\nsequence and the post-main sequence evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 15:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\nelectron nematicity has been recently observed in the iron-pnictide and cuprate\nhigh-temperature superconductors. Whether such a tendency of electrons to\nself-organise unidirectionally has a common feature in these superconductors\nis, however, a highly controversial issue. In the cuprates, the nematicity has\nbeen suggested as a possible source of the pseudogap phase, whilst in the\niron-pnictides, it has been commonly associated with the\ntetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural phase transition at $T_s$. Here, we\nprovide the first thermodynamic evidence in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 that the nematicity\ndevelops well above the structural transition and persists to the nonmagnetic\nsuperconducting regime, resulting in a new phase diagram strikingly similar to\nthe pseudogap phase diagram in the cuprates. Our highly sensitive magnetic\nanisotropy measurements using microcantilever torque-magnetometry under\nin-plane field rotation reveal pronounced two-fold oscillations, which break\nthe tetragonal symmetry. Combined with complementary high-resolution\nsynchrotron X-ray and resistivity measurements, our results consistently\nidentify two distinct temperatures - one at $T^{\\ast}$, signifying a true\nnematic transition, and the other at $T_s (< T^{\\ast})$, which we show to be\nnot a true phase transition, but rather what we refer to as a \"meta-nematic\ntransition\", in analogy to the well-known metamagnetic transition in the theory\nof magnetism. Our observation of the extended nematic phase above the\nsuperconducting dome establishes that the nematicity has primarily an\nelectronic origin, inherent in the normal state of high-temperature\nsuperconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 15:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-05"}

In actual fact, about 90% of connections on the internet use TCP to\ncommunicate. Through several upgrades and improvements, TCP became well\noptimized for the very reliable wired networks. As a result, TCP considers all\npacket timeouts in wired networks as due to network congestion and not to bit\nerrors. However, with networking becoming more heterogeneous, providing wired\nas well as wireless topologies, TCP suffers from performance degradation over\nerror-prone wireless links as it has no mechanism to differentiate error losses\nfrom congestion losses. It therefore considers all packet losses as due to\ncongestion and consequently reduces the burst of packet, diminishing at the\nsame time the network throughput. This paper proposes a new TCP congestion\ncontrol scheme appropriate for wireless as well as wired networks and is\ncapable of distinguishing congestion losses from error losses. The proposed\nscheme is based on using the reserved field of the TCP header to indicate\nwhether the established connection is over a wired or a wireless link.\nAdditionally, the proposed scheme leverages the SNR ratio to detect the\nreliability of the link and decide whether to reduce packet burst or retransmit\na timed-out packet. Experiments conducted, revealed that the proposed scheme\nproved to behave correctly in situations where timeouts were due to error and\nnot to congestion. Future work can improve upon the proposed scheme so much so\nthat it can leverage CRC and HEC errors so as to better determine the cause of\ntransmission timeouts in wireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2012 08:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-06"}
