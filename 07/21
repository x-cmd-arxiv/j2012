Since then, these\nideas has proved extremely fruitful. A rich statistical methodology has\ndeveloped that is based on data depth and, more general, nonparametric depth\nstatistics. General notions of data depth have been introduced as well as many\nspecial ones. These notions vary regarding their computability and robustness\nand their sensitivity to reflect asymmetric shapes of the data. According to\ntheir different properties they fit to particular applications. The upper level\nsets of a depth statistic provide a family of set-valued statistics, named\ndepth-trimmed or central regions. They describe the distribution regarding its\nlocation, scale and shape. The most central region serves as a median. The\nnotion of depth has been extended from data clouds, that is empirical\ndistributions, to general probability distributions on R^d, thus allowing for\nlaws of large numbers and consistency results. It has also been extended from\nd-variate data to data in functional spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 16:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Oct 2012 12:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-18"}

Motivated by this\nprogress, we explore here the benefits of performing the relevant computations\nin a Geometric Algebra framework, which is particularly suited to describing\nreflections. Starting from the Coxeter generators of the reflections, we\ndescribe how the relevant chiral (rotational), full (Coxeter) and binary\npolyhedral groups can be easily generated and treated in a unified way in a\nversor formalism. In particular, this yields a simple construction of the\nbinary polyhedral groups as discrete spinor groups. These in turn are known to\ngenerate Lie and Coxeter groups in dimension four, notably the exceptional\ngroups D_4, F_4 and H_4. A Clifford algebra approach thus reveals an unexpected\nconnection between Coxeter groups of ranks 3 and 4. We discuss how to extend\nthese considerations and computations to the Conformal Geometric Algebra setup,\nin particular for the non-crystallographic groups, and construct root systems\nand quasicrystalline point arrays. We finally show how a Clifford versor\nframework sheds light on the geometry of the Coxeter element and the Coxeter\nplane for the examples of the two-dimensional non-crystallographic Coxeter\ngroups I_2(n) and the three-dimensional groups A_3, B_3, as well as the\nicosahedral group H_3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 17:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 00:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

Alice keeps an ancilla photon and sends a signal photon to Bob,\nwhere intrinsic bi-partite correlation of these photons is obtained through\nfirst order intensity correlation in their detectors. The key bits are\ndistributed through sharing four bi-partite correlation functions and photon\ncounting. The scheme consists of two parts; first, Alice prepares deterministic\nphoton states and Bob measures the photon states based on his random choice on\ncorrelation functions. Second, Alice guesses Bob's choice of correlation\nfunctions and sets the key bits by sending out photon states. Bob verifies the\nkey bits through the photon states regardless Alice made a right or wrong\nguess. We called this key distribution scheme as prepare-measure-guess-verify\n(PMGV) protocol. We discuss the protocol by using a highly attenuated laser\nlight, and then point out the advantages of using a fiber based correlated\nphoton-pair to achieve better performance in security, communication distance\nand success rate of key distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 17:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-23"}

A constraint of $2M \\leq N$ is imposed so that random coding with\nmessage-splitting achieves the optimal GDOF. Unlike symmetric case, two cross\nchannels to unintended receivers from each transmitter can have different\nstrengths, and hence, well known Han-Kobayashi common-private message splitting\nwould not achieve the optimal GDOF. Instead, splitting each user's message into\nthree parts is shown to achieve the optimal GDOF. The capacity of the\ncorresponding deterministic model is first established which provides\nsystematic way of determining side information for converse. Although this\ndeterministic model is philosophically similar to the one considered by Gou and\nJafar, additional constraints are imposed so that capacity description of the\ndeterministic model only contains the essential terms for establishing the GDOF\nof Gaussian case. Based on this, the optimal GDOF of Gaussian case is\nestablished with $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ capacity approximation.

Both the average macroscopic behavior and the fluctuating\nproperties of the hydrodynamic fields are obtained from the microscopic\ndynamics. This analysis yields a fluctuating balance equation for the local\nenergy density at the mesoscopic level, characterized by two terms: (i) a\ndiffusive term, with a current that fluctuates around its average behavior\ngiven by nonlinear Fourier's law, and (ii) a dissipation term which is a\ngeneral function of the local energy density. The quasi-elasticity of\nmicroscopic dynamics, required in order to have a nontrivial competition\nbetween diffusion and dissipation in the macroscopic limit, implies a noiseless\ndissipation term in the balance equation, so dissipation fluctuations are\nenslaved to those of the density field. The microscopic complexity is thus\ncondensed in just three transport coefficients, the diffusivity, the mobility\nand a new dissipation coefficient, which are explicitly calculated within a\nlocal equilibrium approximation. Interestingly, the diffusivity and mobility\ncoefficients obey an Einstein relation despite the fully nonequilibrium\ncharacter of the problem. The general theory here presented is applied to a\nparticular albeit broad family of systems, the simplest nonlinear dissipative\nvariant of the so-called KMP model for heat transport. The theoretical\npredictions are compared to extensive numerical simulations, and an excellent\nagreement is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 18:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-29"}

For this reason,\ncomparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny\nthat describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The\nprobability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for\ntrait evolution, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this fixed tree.\nHowever, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to\nestimates of other evolutionary quantities, and many comparative evolutionary\nbiologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this paper, we present a\nframework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in\ncomparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a\ncontinuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we\nderive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity,\nwhich is the sum of branch lengths connecting a set of taxa. We then present a\ngeneralization of phylogenetic diversity which is equivalent to the expected\ntrait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated\nby a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We derive\nexpressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree.\nGiven one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast\nlikelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades.

Besides highly reliable communication and\nefficient utilization of the radio spectrum, the security of information\ntransmission against eavesdropping is critical in the cognitive radios for many\npotential applications. In this paper, this problem is investigated from an\ninformation theoretic viewpoint. Capacity limits are explored for the Cognitive\nRadio Channel (CRC) with confidential messages. As an idealized information\ntheoretic model for the cognitive radio, this channel includes two transmitters\nwhich send independent messages to their corresponding receivers such that one\ntransmitter, i.e., the cognitive transmitter, has access non-causally to the\nmessage of the other transmitter, i.e., the primary transmitter. The message\ndesignated to each receiver is required to be kept confidential with respect to\nthe other receiver. The secrecy level for each message is evaluated using the\nequivocation rate. Novel inner and outer bounds for the capacity-equivocation\nregion are established. It is shown that these bounds coincide for some special\ncases. Specifically, the capacity-equivocation region is derived for a class of\nless-noisy CRCs and also a class of semi-deterministic CRCs. For the case where\nonly the message of the cognitive transmitter is required to be kept\nconfidential, the capacity-equivocation region is also established for the\nGaussian CRC with weak interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 19:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 19:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 13:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

The method takes into account the gap\nbetween the mass of real stars and that of the star-particles in N-body\nsimulations, which best correspond to the mass of star clusters with different\nage and metallicity, i.e. a manifold of single stellar sopulations (SSP).\nMethods.

Its optical design consists of front-end re-imaging optics, an\nall-reflective image slicer-type, integral field unit (IFU) called FISICA, and\na long-slit grating spectrograph back-end that is coupled with a HAWAII 2RG\nfocal plane array. The full wavelength range is achieved by selecting between\ntwo different gratings. By virtue of its re-imaging optics, the spectrograph is\nquite versatile and can be used at multiple telescopes. The size of its\nfield-of-view is unrivalled by other similar spectrographs, offering a 4.5\" x\n12\" integral field at a 10-meter class telescope (or 20\" x 50\" at a 2.3-meter\ntelescope). The use of WIFIS will be crucial in astronomical problems which\nrequire wide-field, two-dimensional spectroscopy such as the study of merging\ngalaxies at moderate redshift and nearby star/planet-forming regions and\nsupernova remnants. We discuss the final optical design of WIFIS, and its\npredicted on-sky performance on two reference telescope platforms: the 2.3-m\nSteward Bok telescope and the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We also present\nthe results from our laboratory characterization of FISICA. IFU properties such\nas magnification, field-mapping, and slit width along the entire slit length\nwere measured by our tests. The construction and testing of WIFIS is expected\nto be completed by early 2013. We plan to commission the instrument at the\n2.3-m Steward Bok telescope at Kitt Peak, USA in Spring 2013.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 20:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We use density functional\ntheory, corrected for onsite Coulombic interactions (DFT+U), to explore various\nadsorption sites and configurations for CO2 on stoichiometric and reduced CeO2\n(110). Our model of reduced CeO2 (110) contains oxygen vacancies at the topmost\natomic layer and undergoes surface reconstruction upon introduction of these\nvacancies. We find that CO2 adsorption on reduced CeO2 (110) is\nthermodynamically favored over the corresponding adsorption on stoichiometric\nCeO2 (110). The most stable adsorption configuration consists of CO2 adsorbed\nparallel to the reduced CeO2 (110) surface, with the molecule situated near the\nsite of the oxygen vacancy. Structural changes in the CO2 molecule are also\nobserved upon adsorption, so that the resulting O-C-O angle is 136.9 degrees\nand the C-O bonds are 1.198 Angstroms and 1.311 Angstroms in length,\nrespectively. The molecule bends out of plane to form a unidentate carbonate,\nas opposed to the bidentate carbonate found by other researchers for CO\nadsorption to stoichiometric CeO2. We deduce that charge transfer from reduced\nsurface Ce3+ ions to the adsorbate to form the carbonate anion is the first\nstep in the activation and reduction process and cleavage of the C-O bond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 01:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

The\nexamples of accelerating universe which includes phantom, quintessence and\n$\\Lambda$CDM acceleration are worked out in detail and their physical\nproperties are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 07:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 04:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

As a by-product, our method produces a\ndictionary of optimized orthonormal descriptors for each segmented region. The\nunique feature of our method is that it achieves the simultaneous segmentation\nand description for non-smooth image structures under the same optimization\nframework.

We show\nthat when the external trap potential and finite-range interparticle\ninteraction have a time-dependency the exact solutions of the corresponding\ntime-dependent many-boson Schr\\\"odinger equation are still available. We use\nthese exact solutions to benchmark the recently developed multiconfigurational\ntime-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 99},\n030402 (2007), Phys. Rev.

In particular, we\nbenchmark the MCTDHB method for: (i) the ground state; (ii) the breathing\nmany-body dynamics activated by a quench scenario where the interparticle\ninteraction strength is suddenly turned on to a finite value; (iii) the\nnon-equilibrium dynamic for driven scenarios where both the trap- and\ninterparticle-interaction potentials are {\\it time-dependent}. Excellent\nconvergence of the ground state and dynamics is demonstrated. The great\nrelevance of the self-consistency and time-adaptivity, which are the intrinsic\nfeatures of the MCTDHB method, is demonstrated by contrasting the MCTDHB\npredictions and those obtained within the standard full configuration\ninteraction method spanning the Fock space of the same size, but utilizing as\none-particle basis set the fixed-shape eigenstates of the one-particle\npotential.

The difficulty comes\nfrom the assumption that decisions are irrevocable: if we choose to accept an\nelement when it is presented by the stream then we can never get rid of it, and\nif we choose not to accept it then we cannot later add it. Babaioff, Immorlica,\nand Kleinberg [SODA 2007] introduced this problem, gave O(1)-competitive\nalgorithms for certain classes of matroids, and conjectured that every matroid\nadmits an O(1)-competitive algorithm. However, most matroids that are known to\nadmit an O(1)-competitive algorithm can be easily represented using graphs\n(e.g. graphic and transversal matroids). In particular, there is very little\nknown about F-representable matroids (the class of matroids that can be\nrepresented as elements of a vector space over a field F), which are one of the\nfoundational matroid classes. Moreover, most of the known techniques are as\ndependent on graph theory as they are on matroid theory. We go beyond graphs by\ngiving an O(1)-competitive algorithm for regular matroids (the class of\nmatroids that are representable over every field), and use techniques that are\nmatroid-theoretic rather than graph-theoretic. We use the regular matroid\ndecomposition theorem of Seymour to decompose any regular matroid into matroids\nwhich are either graphic, cographic, or isomorphic to R_{10}, and then show how\nto combine algorithms for these basic classes into an algorithm for regular\nmatroids. This allows us to generalize beyond regular matroids to any class of\nmatroids that admits such a decomposition into classes for which we already\nhave good algorithms. In particular, we give an O(1)-competitive algorithm for\nthe class of max-flow min-cut matroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 14:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

A nonrepetitive\ncoloring of a graph is a coloring of its vertices such that all simple paths\nare nonrepetitively colored.
