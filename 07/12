The abundances of many observed compounds in interstellar molecular\nclouds still lack an explanation, despite extensive research that includes both\ngas and solid (dust-grain surface) phase reactions. Aims. We aim to\nqualitatively prove the idea that a hydrogen-poor subsurface chemistry on\ninterstellar grains is responsible for at least some of these chemical\n\"anomalies\". This chemistry develops in the icy mantles when photodissociation\nreactions in the mantle release free hydrogen, which escapes the mantle via\ndiffusion. This results in serious alterations of the chemical composition of\nthe mantle because pores in the mantle provide surfaces for reactions in the\nnew, hydrogen-poor environment. Methods. We present a simple kinetic model,\nusing existing astrochemical reaction databases. Gas phase, surface and\nsubsurface pore reactions are included, as are physical transformations of\nmolecules. Results. Our model produces significantly higher abundances for\nvarious oxidized species than most other models. We also obtain quite good\nresults for some individual species that have adequate reaction network. Thus,\nwe consider that the hydrogen-poor mantle chemistry may indeed play a role in\nthe chemical evolution of molecular clouds. Conclusions. The significance of\noutward hydrogen diffusion has to be proved by further research. A huge number\nof solid phase reactions between many oxidized species is essential to obtain\ngood, quantitative modeling results for a comparison with observations. We\nspeculate that a variety of unobservable hydrogen-poor sulfur oxoacid\nderivatives may be responsible for the \"disappearance\" of sulfur in dark cloud\ncores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 16:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-12"}

As in standard projection operator methods, a set of resolved\nvariables is selected to capture the slow, macroscopic behavior of the system,\nand the family of quasi-equilibrium probability densities on phase space\ncorresponding to these resolved variables is employed as a statistical model.\nThe macroscopic dynamics of the mean resolved variables is determined by\noptimizing over paths of these probability densities. Specifically, a cost\nfunction is introduced that quantifies the lack-of-fit of such paths to the\nunderlying microscopic dynamics; it is an ensemble-averaged, squared-norm of\nthe residual that results from submitting a path of trial densities to the\nLiouville equation. The evolution of the macrostate is estimated by minimizing\nthe time integral of the cost function. The value function for this\noptimization satisfies the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and it\ndetermines the optimal relation between the statistical parameters and the\nirreversible fluxes of the resolved variables, thereby closing the reduced\ndynamics. The resulting equations for the macroscopic variables have the\ngeneric form of governing equations for nonequilibrium thermodynamics, and they\nfurnish a rational extension of the classical equations of linear irreversible\nthermodynamics beyond the near-equilibrium regime.

No evidence of positive superhumps was\ndetected during this observation. This finding indicates that the disk\nexhibited retrograde precession during this superoutburst, contrary to all\nother known cases of superoutbursts. The duration of this superoutburst was\nshorter than those of ordinary superoutbursts and the intervals of normal\noutbursts were longer than ordinary ones. We suggest a possibility that such\nunusual outburst properties are likely a result of the disk tilt, which is\nsupposed to be a cause of negative superhumps: the tilted disk could prevent\nthe disk from being filled with materials in the outmost region which is\nsupposed to be responsible for long-duration superoutbursts in ER UMa-type\ndwarf novae. The discovery signifies the importance of the classical prograde\nprecession in sustaining long-duration superoutbursts. Furthermore, the\npresence of pronounced negative superhumps in this system with a high\nmass-transfer rate favors the hypothesis that hydrodynamical lift is the cause\nof the disk tilt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 16:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Recent radiative transfer\ncalculations support this picture and show that the spectral peak is inherited\nfrom initially thermal radiation, which is changed by heating into a broad\nphoton distribution with a high-energy tail. We discuss the processes that\nregulate the observed position of the spectral peak E_pk. The opaque jet has\nthree radial zones: (1) Planck zone r<R_P where a blackbody spectrum is\nenforced; this zone ends where Thomson optical depth decreases to tau~10^5. (2)\nWien zone R_P<r<R_W with Kompaneets parameter y>>1 where radiation has a\nBose-Einstein spectrum, and (3) Comptonization zone r>R_W where the radiation\nspectrum develops the high-energy tail. Besides the initial jet temperature, an\nimportant factor regulating E_pk is internal dissipation (of bulk motions and\nmagnetic energy) at large distances from the central engine. Dissipation in the\nPlanck zone reduces E_pk, and dissipation in the Wien zone increases E_pk. In\njets with sub-dominant magnetic fields, the predicted E_pk varies around 1 MeV\nup to a maximum value of about 10 MeV. If the jet carries an energetically\nimportant magnetic field, E_pk can be additionally increased by dissipation of\nmagnetic energy. This increase is hinted by observations, which show E_pk up to\nabout 20 MeV. We also consider magnetically dominated jets; then a simple model\nof magnetic dissipation gives E_pk~30 Gamma_W keV where Gamma_W is the jet\nLorentz factor at the Wien radius R_W.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 16:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Nov 2012 15:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The SMA data (angular\nresolution ~0.6\") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, while\nthe Keck AO Ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1\") resolve the lens into a\npair of galaxies separated by 0.3\". We present an optical spectrum of the\nforeground lens obtained with the Gemini-South telescope that provides a lens\nredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. We develop and apply a new lens modeling\ntechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the SMG is magnified by a\nfactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (IR) luminosity of\nL_IR = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 Lsun. We measure a half-light radius of the\nbackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an IR luminosity\nsurface density of Sigma_IR = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 Lsun kpc^-2, a value that\nis typical of z > 2 SMGs but significantly lower than IR luminous galaxies at\nz~0. The two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types with\nEinstein radii of theta_E1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_E2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 that\nimply masses of M_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 Msun and M_lens2 = (3.7 +/-\n0.3) x 10^10 Msun. The two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo a\ndissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should be\nsimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6.

To break this tension we explore\nSED fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) and\nallow for nebular emission.

The planets' masses, M1 and M2, correspond to those of\nJupiter and Saturn. Hydrodynamical calculations in two and three dimensions are\nused to quantify the migration rates and analyze the conditions under which the\noutward migration mechanism may operate. The planets are taken to be fully\nformed after 1e6 and before 3e6 years. The orbital evolution of the planets in\nan evolving disk is then calculated until the disk's gas is completely\ndissipated. Orbital locking in the 3:2 mean motion resonance may lead to\noutward migration under appropriate conditions of disk viscosity and\ntemperature. However, resonance locking does not necessarily result in outward\nmigration. This is the case, for example, if convergent migration leads to\nlocking in the 2:1 mean motion resonance, as post-formation disk conditions\nseem to suggest. Accretion of gas on the planets may deactivate the outward\nmigration mechanism by raising the mass ratio M2/M1 and/or by reducing the\naccretion rate toward the star, hence depleting the inner disk. For migrating\nplanets locked in the 3:2 mean motion resonance, there are stalling radii that\ndepend on disk viscosity and on stellar irradiation, when it determines the\ndisk's thermal balance.

As\nfast rotation causes spectral features to be washed out, stars with low\nprojected rotational velocities are sought for radial velocity surveys.\n  At our intermediate spectral resolution we have confirmed the identification\nof neutral atomic lines reported in Mclean et al. 2007. We also calculated\npseudo-equivalent widths (p-EW) of 12 atomic lines. Our results confirm that\nthe p-EW of K I lines are strongly dependent on spectral types. We observe that\nthe p-EW of Fe I and Mn I lines remain fairly constant with later spectral\ntype. We suggest that those lines are particularly suitable for deriving\nmetallicities for late-M dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 20:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

A natural\nconsequence of STDP is establishment of causality in the sense that a neuron\nlearns to fire with a lag after specific presynaptic neurons have fired. The\neffect of STDP on synchrony is elusive because spike synchrony implies unitary\nspike events of different neurons rather than a causal delayed relationship\nbetween neurons. We explore how synchrony can be facilitated by STDP in\noscillator networks with a pacemaker. We show that STDP with asymmetric\nlearning windows leads to self-organization of feedforward networks starting\nfrom the pacemaker. As a result, STDP drastically facilitates frequency\nsynchrony. Even though differences in spike times are lessened as a result of\nsynaptic plasticity, the finite time lag remains so that perfect spike\nsynchrony is not realized. In contrast to traditional mechanisms of large-scale\nsynchrony based on mutual interaction of coupled neurons, the route to\nsynchrony discovered here is enslavement of downstream neurons by upstream\nones. Facilitation of such feedforward synchrony does not occur for STDP with\nsymmetric learning windows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 00:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-13"}

We address this\nissue by explicitly modeling the ancillary cost associated with demand\nvariability. We argue that a time-varying price equal to the suppliers'\ninstantaneous marginal cost may not achieve social optimality, and that\nconsumer demand fluctuations should be properly priced. We propose a dynamic\npricing mechanism that explicitly encourages consumers to adapt their\nconsumption so as to offset the variability of demand on conventional units.\nThrough a dynamic game-theoretic formulation, we show that (under suitable\nconvexity assumptions) the proposed pricing mechanism achieves social\noptimality asymptotically, as the number of consumers increases to infinity.\nNumerical results demonstrate that compared with marginal cost pricing, the\nproposed mechanism creates a stronger incentive for consumers to shift their\npeak load, and therefore has the potential to reduce the need for long-term\ninvestment in peaking plants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 05:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-13"}

From EUV observations, the wave signature appears to be dome shaped\nhaving a component propagating on the solar surface (v~280 km s-1) as well as\noff-disk (v~600 km s-1) away from the Sun. The off-disk dome of the wave\nconsists of two enhancements in intensity, which conjointly develop and can be\nfollowed up to white-light coronagraph images.

The method proceeds in the opposite way compared\nto a monochromator-based method, by simultaneously removing several sharp\nenergy bands from the incident beam, instead of selecting a single one. It uses\na diamond single crystal placed upstream of the sample. Each Laue diffraction\nby diamond lattice planes attenuates the corresponding energy in the incident\nspectrum. By rotating the crystal, the filtered-out energies can be varied in a\ncontrolled manner, allowing one to determine the extinction energies of several\nLaue spots of the studied sample. The energies filtered-out by the diamond\ncrystal are obtained by measuring its Laue pattern with an other 2D detector,\nat each rotation step. This article demonstrates the feasibility of the method,\nand its validation through the measurement of a known lattice parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 07:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jul 2012 20:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 17:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-19"}

Due to the intrinsic atom-cavity field\nnonlinearity, several interesting phenomena arise which are the focuses of this\nwork. For the energy structure, the bistability appears in the energy levels\ndue to this atoms-cavity field nonlinearity, and the same phenomena can be\nfound in the intra-cavity photons number. With an increase of the pump-cavity\ndetunings, the higher and lower energy levels show a loop structure due to this\ncavity-mediated effects. In the dynamical process, an extensive numerical\nsimulation of localization of the BECs for atoms initially trapped in one-,\ntwo-, and three-wells are performed for the symmetric and asymmetric cases in\ndetail. It is shown that the the transition from oscillation to the\nlocalization can be modified by the cavity-mediated potential, which will\nenlarge the regions of oscillation. With the increasing of the atomic\ninteraction, the oscillation is blocked and the localization emerges. The\ncondensates atoms can be trapped either in one-, two-, or in three wells\neventually where they are initially uploaded for certain parameters. In\nparticular, we find that the transition from the oscillation to the\nlocalization is accompanied with some irregular regime where tunneling dynamics\nis dominated by chaos for this cavity-mediated system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 10:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-13"}

The data reveal significant\ncycle-to-cycle fluctuations in the pulsation period, indicating that classical\nCepheids may not be as accurate astrophysical clocks as commonly believed:\nregardless of the specific points used to determine the O-C values, the cycle\nlengths show a scatter of 0.015-0.02 days over the 120 cycles covered by the\nobservations. A very slight correlation between the individual Fourier\nparameters and the O-C values was found, suggesting that the O - C variations\nmight be due to the instability of the light curve shape. Random fluctuation\ntests revealed a linear trend up to a cycle difference 15, but for long term,\nthe period remains around the mean value. We compare the measurements with\nsimulated light curves that were constructed to mimic V1154 Cyg as a perfect\npulsator modulated only by the light travel time effect caused by low-mass\ncompanions. We show that the observed period jitter in V1154 Cyg represents a\nserious limitation in the search for binary companions. While the Kepler data\nare accurate enough to allow the detection of planetary bodies in close orbits\naround a Cepheid, the astrophysical noise can easily hide the signal of the\nlight-time effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 10:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2012 10:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this paper we study the all-logit\ndynamics, where at each time step all players concurrently update their\nstrategies according to the logit choice function. In the well studied\none-logit dynamics [Blume, 1993] instead at each step only one randomly chosen\nplayer is allowed to update.\n  We study properties of the all-logit dynamics in the context of local\ninteraction games, a class of games that has been used to model complex social\nphenomena and physical systems. In a local interaction game, players are the\nvertices of a social graph whose edges are two-player potential games. Each\nplayer picks one strategy to be played for all the games she is involved in and\nthe payoff of the player is the sum of the payoffs from each of the games. We\nprove that local interaction games characterize the class of games for which\nthe all-logit dynamics is reversible.\n  We then compare the stationary behavior of one-logit and all-logit dynamics.\nSpecifically, we look at the expected value of a notable class of observables,\nthat we call decomposable observables. We prove that the difference between the\nexpected values of the observables at stationarity for the two dynamics depends\nonly on the rationality level beta and on the distance of the social graph from\na bipartite graph. In particular, if the social graph is bipartite then\ndecomposable observables have the same expected value. Finally, we show that\nthe mixing time of the all-logit dynamics has the same twofold behavior that\nhas been highlighted in the case of the one-logit: for some games it\nexponentially depends on the rationality level beta, whereas for other games it\ncan be upper bounded by a function independent from beta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 10:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2012 14:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2013 13:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2013 19:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-31"}

A\nmajor goal of the review is to integrate the several approaches proposed in the\nliterature, from semi-microscopic to phenomenological. In particular, we first\nconsider \"dry\" systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to\nfriction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium, and clarify the\ndifferences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered\nstates, the nematic and the polar. We then consider the active hydrodynamics of\na suspension, and relate as well as contrast it with the dry case. We further\nhighlight various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of\nmatter. We discuss and connect various semi-microscopic derivations of the\ncontinuum theory, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum\nmodel. Throughout the review, we discuss the experimental relevance of these\ntheories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of\nliving cells, and vibrated granular materials. We suggest promising extensions\ntowards greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to ethology, and\nremark on some exotic active-matter analogues. Lastly, we summarize the outlook\nfor a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of\ndetailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living\nor artificial constituents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 11:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-13"}

Since the\nformer step is not subject to any stability restriction, the Courant condition\nis computed only in terms of the residual velocity, leading to substantially\nlarger time steps. The magnetic field is advanced in time using the constrained\ntransport method in order to preserve the divergence-free condition.\nConservation of total energy and angular momentum is enforced at the discrete\nlevel by properly expressing the source terms in terms of upwind fluxes\navailable during the standard solver.\n  Our results show that applications of the proposed orbital-advection scheme\nto problems of astrophysical relevance provides, at reduced numerical cost,\nequally accurate and less dissipative results than standard time-marching\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

To make the APP more\nefficient for high-contrast imaging, its bandwidth should be as large as\npossible, and the location of the D-shaped area should be easily swapped to the\nother side of the PSF. We present the design of a broadband APP that yields two\nPSFs that have the opposite sides cleared out. Both properties are enabled by a\nhalf-wave liquid crystal layer, for which the local fast axis orientation over\nthe pupil is forced to follow the required phase structure. For each of the two\ncircular polarization states, the required phase apodization is thus obtained,\nand, moreover, the PSFs after a quarter-wave plate and a polarizing\nbeam-splitter are complementary due to the antisymmetric nature of the phase\napodization. The device can be achromatized in the same way as half-wave plates\nof the Pancharatnam type or by layering self-aligning twisted liquid crystals\nto form a monolithic film called a multi-twist retarder. As the VAPP introduces\na known phase diversity between the two PSFs, they may be used directly for\nwavefront sensing. By applying an additional quarter-wave plate in front, the\ndevice also acts as a regular polarizing beam-splitter, which therefore\nfurnishes high-contrast polarimetric imaging. If the PSF core is not saturated,\nthe polarimetric dual-beam correction can also be applied to polarized\ncircumstellar structure.

When a\nresistor reaches its fatigue threshold, it burns irreversibly. Over time, this\ndrives cracks to grow until the system is fractured in two parts. We study the\nrelation between the macroscopic exponent of the crack growth rate -- entering\nthe phenomenological Paris law -- and the microscopic damage-accumulation\nexponent, $\\gamma$, under the influence of disorder. The way the jumps of the\ngrowing crack, $\\Delta a$, and the waiting-time between successive breaks,\n$\\Delta t$, depend on the type of material, via $\\gamma$, are also\ninvestigated. We find that the averages of these quantities, $<\\Delta a>$ and\n$<\\Delta t>/<t_r>$, scale as power laws of the crack length $a$, $<\\Delta a>\n\\propto a^{\\alpha}$ and $<\\Delta t>/<t_r> \\propto a^{-\\beta}$, where $<t_r>$ is\nthe average rupture time. Strikingly, our results show, for small values of\n$\\gamma$, a decrease in the exponent of the Paris law in comparison with the\nhomogeneous case, leading to an increase in the lifetime of breaking materials.\nFor the particular case of $\\gamma=0$, when fatigue is exclusively ruled by\ndisorder, an analytical treatment confirms the results obtained by simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 14:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-05"}

Skands of finite lengths are ordinary\nwell-founded sets, and skands of very long length (like the hyper-skand of all\nordinals) are hyper-classes.\n  Self-similar skands are also considered, and they clarify the reflexivity of\nsets, i.e., the meaning of the relation X is a member of X; in particular,\nself-similar skands considered as non-well-founded sets are always reflexive,\nbut not vice versa. The existence of self-similar skands shows at once that\nRussell's well-known paradox is not a paradox at all. The inconsistency of\nRussell's \"set\" R, which is the collection of all sets that are not members of\nthemselves, is proved here not with the help of Russell's paradox (as it is\ntraditionally given, which is incorrect), but via a simple method of the\nmaximality (universality) of R which goes back to Cantor and can be also\napplied to other set-theoretical paradoxes.\n  Generalized skands are also defined and a new look at the generalized\nskand-class of all ordinals is demonstrated.

The spectrally\ndispersed visibility data are analyzed by fitting a circular fully\nlimb-darkened disk (FDD). Results. The FDD diameter as function of wavelength\nis similar for all oxygen-rich stars. The apparent size is almost constant\nbetween 8 and 10 micron and gradually increases at wavelengths longer than 10\nmicron. The apparent FDD diameter in the carbon-rich star V Hya essentially\ndecreases from 8 to 12 micron. The FDD diameters are about 2.2 times larger\nthan the photospheric diameters estimated from K-band observations found in the\nliterature. The silicate dust shells of R Aql, R Hya and W Hya are located\nfairly far away from the star, while the silicate dust shell of R Aqr and the\namorphous carbon (AMC) and SiC dust shell of V Hya are found to be closer to\nthe star at around 8 photospheric radii. Phase-to-phase variations of the\ndiameters of the oxygen-rich stars could be measured and are on the order of\n15% but with large uncertainties. From a comparison of the diameter trend with\nthe trends in RR Sco and S Ori it can be concluded that in oxygen-rich stars\nthe overall larger diameter originates from a warm molecular layer of H2O, and\nthe gradual increase longward of 10 micron can be most likely attributed to the\ncontribution of a close Al2O3 dust shell. The chromatic trend of the Gaussian\nFWHM in V Hya can be explained with the presence of AMC and SiC dust. The\nobservations suggest that the formation of amorphous Al2O3 in oxygen- rich\nstars occurs mainly around or after visual minimum. However, no firm\nconclusions can be drawn concerning the mass-loss mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
