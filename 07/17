(1) Microlensing observations toward the Magellanic\nClouds rule out the Milky Way halo being dominated by MAssive Compact Halo\nObjects (MACHOs). This confirms most dark matter is non-baryonic, consistent\nwith other observations. (2) Microlensing has discovered about 20 extrasolar\nplanets (16 published), including the first two Jupiter-Saturn like systems and\nthe only \"cold Neptunes\" yet detected. They probe a different part of the\nparameter space and will likely provide the most stringent test of core\naccretion theory of planet formation. (3) Microlensing provides a unique way to\nmeasure the mass of isolated stars, including brown dwarfs to normal stars.\nHalf a dozen or so stellar mass black hole candidates have also been proposed.\n(4) High-resolution, target-of-opportunity spectra of highly-magnified dwarf\nstars provide intriguing \"age\" determinations which may either hint at enhanced\nhelium enrichment or unusual bulge formation theories. (5) Microlensing also\nmeasured limb-darkening profiles for close to ten giant stars, which challenges\nstellar atmosphere models. (6) Data from surveys also provide strong\nconstraints on the geometry and kinematics of the Milky Way bar (through proper\nmotions); the latter indicates predictions from current models appear to be too\nanisotropic compared with observations.

Stellar-mass black holes in the \"low/hard\" state are an\nexcellent laboratory in which to study disk-jet connections, but few\ncoordinated observations are made using spectrometers that can incisively probe\nthe inner disk. We report on a series of 20 Suzaku observations of Cygnus X-1\nmade in the jet-producing low/hard state. Contemporaneous radio monitoring was\ndone using the Arcminute MicroKelvin Array radio telescope. Two important and\nsimple results are obtained: (1) the jet (as traced by radio flux) does not\nappear to be modulated by changes in the inner radius of the accretion disk;\nand (2) the jet is sensitive to disk properties, including its flux,\ntemperature, and ionization. Some more complex results may reveal aspects of a\ncoupled disk-corona-jet system. A positive correlation between the reflected\nX-ray flux and radio flux may represent specific support for a plasma ejection\nmodel of the corona, wherein the base of a jet produces hard X-ray emission.\nWithin the framework of the plasma ejection model, the spectra suggest a jet\nbase with v/c ~ 0.3, or the escape velocity for a vertical height of z ~ 20\nGM/c^2 above the black hole. The detailed results of X-ray disk continuum and\nreflection modeling also suggest a height of z ~ 20 GM/c^2 for hard X-ray\nproduction above a black hole, with a spin in the range 0.6 < a < 0.99. This\nheight agrees with X-ray time lags recently found in Cygnus X-1.

In an intermediate regime, with a\nmass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss\nduring the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences\nfallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of\nsuch an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,\npossibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that\nmay or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic\nsignature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer\nthrough the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is\noccurring inside. We explore whether fallback onto young NSs can be detected by\nground-based interferometers. When the incoming material has sufficient angular\nmomentum to form a disk, the accretion spins up the NS sufficiently to produce\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and gravitational radiation at frequencies of\n~700-2400 Hz for ~30-3000 s until collapse to a BH occurs. Using a realistic\nexcess cross-power search algorithm, we show that such events are detectable by\nAdvanced LIGO out to ~17 Mpc. From the rate of nearby core-collapse supernovae,\nwe estimate that there will be ~1-2 events each year that are worth checking\nfor fallback GWs. The observation of these unique GW signatures coincident with\nelectromagnetic detections would identify the transient events that are\nassociated with this channel of BH formation, while providing information about\nthe protoneutron star progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jul 2012 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Three-dimensional magnetic fields are included in the\nperturbation equations; however the equilibrium is assumed to be well-described\nby purely hydrodynamic forces. The model, in principle very general, is used to\nstudy the behavior of fluid displacements in an environment resembling the\nsolar convection zone. Some very suggestive results emerge. All but\nhigh-latitude displacements align themselves with the observed surfaces of\nconstant angular velocity. The tendency for the angular velocity to remain\nconstant with depth in the bulk of the convective zone, together with other\ncritical features of the rotation profile, emerge from little more than a\nvisual inspection of the governing equation. In the absence of a background\naxial angular velocity gradient, displacements exhibit no poleward bias,\nsuggesting that solar convection \"plays-off\" of prexisting shear rather than\ncreates it.

In addition, we show that when a certain maximum-likelihood\nestimation can be performed in each step, the adaptive GAMP method can yield\nasymptotically consistent parameter estimates, which implies that the algorithm\nachieves a reconstruction quality equivalent to the oracle algorithm that knows\nthe correct parameter values. Remarkably, this result applies to essentially\narbitrary parametrizations of the unknown distributions, including ones that\nare nonlinear and non-Gaussian. The adaptive GAMP methodology thus provides a\nsystematic, general and computationally efficient method applicable to a large\nrange of complex linear-nonlinear models with provable guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 01:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2012 13:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 23:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

In this paper,\nwe show that if we use architecturally restricted verifiers instead of\nrestricting the working memory, i.e. replacing the working tape(s) with a\nsingle counter, we can define some IPS's for each decidable language. Such\nverifiers are called two-way probabilistic one-counter automata (2pca's). Then,\nwe show that by adding a fixed-size quantum memory to a 2pca, called a two-way\none-counter automaton with quantum and classical states (2qcca), the protocol\ncan be space efficient. As a further result, if the 2qcca can use a quantum\ncounter instead of a classical one, then the protocol can even be public, also\nknown as Arthur-Merlin games.\n  We also investigate the computational power of 2pca's and 2qcca's as language\nrecognizers. We show that bounded-error 2pca's can be more powerful than their\ndeterministic counterparts by giving a bounded-error simulation of their\nnondeterministic counterparts. Then, we present a new programming technique for\nbounded-error 2qcca's and show that they can recognize a language which seems\nnot to be recognized by any bounded-error 2pca.

Lastly, we prove a conjecture posed by Ravikumar (FSTTCS 1992)\nregarding 1-pebble probabilistic finite automata, i.e. they can recognize some\nnonstochastic languages with bounded error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 05:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-18"}

We present a study of the envelope morphology of the carbon Mira R For\nwith VLTI/MIDI. This object is one of the few asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars that underwent a dust-obscuration event. The cause of such events is\nstill a matter of discussion. Several symmetric and asymmetric scenarios have\nbeen suggested in the literature. Methods. Mid-infrared interferometric\nobservations were obtained separated by two years. The observations probe\ndifferent depths of the atmosphere and cover different pulsation phases. The\nvisibilities and the differential phases were interpreted using GEM-FIND, a\ntool for fitting spectrally dispersed interferometric observations with the\nhelp of wavelength-dependent geometric models. Results. We report the detection\nof an asymmetric structure revealed through the MIDI differential phase. This\nasymmetry is observed at the same baseline and position angle two years later.\nThe observations are best simulated with a model that includes a uniform-disc\nplus a Gaussian envelope plus a point-source. The geometric model can reproduce\nboth the visibilities and the differential phase signatures. Conclusions. Our\nMIDI data favour explanations of the R For obscuration event that are based on\nan asymmetric geometry. We clearly detect a photocentre shift between the star\nand the strongly resolved dust component. This might be caused by a dust clump\nor a substellar companion. However, the available observations do not allow us\nto distinguish between the two options. The finding has strong implications for\nfuture studies of the geometry of the envelope of AGB stars: if this is a\nbinary, are all AGB stars that show an obscuration event binaries as well?

An analysis of three DAs is performed, where\nprevious studies came to conflicting conclusions as to the stars' nitrogen\nconfigurations. The nitrogen abundances were found to be in keeping with DAs of\nhigher Teff, with a homogeneous distribution. A search for circumstellar gas\ndiscs was performed on eight stars, where circumstellar pollution may explain\nthe differences between predicted and observed metal abundances. No positive\ndetections were made. Already the subject of previous studies, the\ncircumstellar absorption features seen at many hot DAs were again analysed,\nusing a more advanced technique than those implemented in previous studies.\nThis allowed, for the first time, column density measurements for all\nnon-photospheric absorbing material. The derived column density measurements\nare consistent with those predicted to exist in white dwarf Stromgren Spheres,\nand the velocities of the absorbing material are not far from the velocities of\neither the observed ISM or predicted LISM clouds along the stars' sight lines.\nHowever, given the distances to some of the stars, it is unlikely that the\nionised material resides in the LISM in all cases; it may however be loosely\nrelated to it. The observations here could not conclusively rule out the\nionisation of circumstellar material about the stars, though no evidence for\nsuch material has yet been found. The velocity of the circumstellar material at\nWD2218+706 is inconsistent with the expansion velocity of the PN at the star,\nimplying that the circumstellar material does not reside in the PN, though it\nmay have originated there. Once though to be related to these circumstellar\nfeatures, mass loss at the DAs has been ruled out, since the high log g of\nthese stars prohibits the loss of significant mass in a stellar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 08:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-18"}

Rather than an alternative to existing automated tools, it is\nput forward as an instrument for quick-look analysis, and for gaining physical\ninsight when interpreting the outputs provided by automated tools. Though the\nrecipe is of general application, it was developed for understanding the nature\nof the Automatic Spectroscopic K-means based (ASK) template spectra. They\nresulted from the classification of all the galaxy spectra in the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey data release 7 (SDSS-DR7), thus being a comprehensive representation\nof the galaxy spectra in the local universe. Using the recipe, we give a\ndescription of the properties of the gas and the stars that characterize the\nASK classes, from those corresponding to passively evolving galaxies, to HII\ngalaxies undergoing a galaxy-wide starburst. The qualitative analysis is found\nto be in excellent agreement with quantitative analyses of the same spectra. A\nnumber of byproducts follow from the analysis. There is a tight correlation\nbetween the age of the stellar population and the metallicity of the gas, which\nis stronger than the correlations between galaxy mass and stellar age, and\ngalaxy mass and gas metallicity. The galaxy spectra are known to follow a\n1-dimensional sequence, and we identify the luminosity-weighted mean stellar\nage as the affine parameter that describes the sequence. All ASK classes happen\nto have a significant fraction of old stars, although spectrum-wise they are\noutshined by the youngest populations. Old stars are metal rich or metal poor\ndepending on whether they reside in passive galaxies or in star-forming\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 09:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We show\nthat such systems have a long pre-contact phase, which lasts for 8-9 Gyrs,\nwhile the contact phase takes only about 0.8 Gyr, which is rather a short\nfraction of the total life. With low mass transfer rate during contact,\nmoderate mass ratios prevail in LMCBs since they do not have enough time to\nreach extreme mass ratios often observed in higher mass binaries. During the\nwhole evolution both components of LMCBs remain within the MS band.\n  The evolution of cool contact binaries towards merging is controlled by the\ninterplay between the evolutionary expansion of the less massive component\nresulting in the mass transfer to the more massive component and the angular\nmomentum loss from the system by the magnetized wind. In LMCB the angular\nmomentum loss prevails. As a result, the orbital period systematically\ndecreases until the binary overflows the outer critical Roche surface and the\ncomponents merge into a single fast rotating star of a solar type surrounded by\na remnant disk carrying excess angular momentum. The disk can be a place of\nplanet formation with the age substantially lower than the age of a host star.\nThe calculated theoretical tracks show good agreement with the physical\nproperties of LMCB from the available observations. Estimates of the frequency\nof occurrence of LMCB and the merger formation rate indicate that about 40\nLMCBs and about 100 low mass merger products is expected to exist within 100 pc\nfrom the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 09:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-23"}

Determining the complexity of testing whether a\nclustered graph admits a c-planar drawing is a long-standing open problem in\nthe Graph Drawing research area. An obvious necessary condition for c-planarity\nis the planarity of the graph underlying the clustered graph. However, such a\ncondition is not sufficient and the consequences on the problem due to the\nrequirement of not having edge-region and region-region crossings are not yet\nfully understood.\n  In order to shed light on the c-planarity problem, we consider a relaxed\nversion of it, where some kinds of crossings (either edge-edge, edge-region, or\nregion-region) are allowed even if the underlying graph is planar. We\ninvestigate the relationships among the minimum number of edge-edge,\nedge-region, and region-region crossings for drawings of the same clustered\ngraph. Also, we consider drawings in which only crossings of one kind are\nadmitted. In this setting, we prove that drawings with only edge-edge or with\nonly edge-region crossings always exist, while drawings with only region-region\ncrossings may not. Further, we provide upper and lower bounds for the number of\nsuch crossings. Finally, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a\ndrawing with only region-region crossings exist for biconnected graphs, hence\nidentifying a first non-trivial necessary condition for c-planarity that can be\ntested in polynomial time for a noticeable class of graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 10:28:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2012 22:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 06:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 15:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

This constant must ideally be chosen at every iteration as small as\npossible, while serving in an indispensable upper bound for the value of the\nobjective function. In the previously existing variants of optimal first-order\nmethods, this upper bound inequality was constructed from points computed\nduring the current iteration. It was thus not possible to select the optimal\nvalue for this Lipschitz constant at the beginning of the iteration.\n  In our variant, the upper bound inequality is constructed from points\navailable before the current iteration, offering us the possibility to set the\nLipschitz constant to its optimal value at once. This procedure, even if\nefficient in practice, presents a higher worse-case complexity than standard\noptimal first-order methods. We propose an alternative strategy that retains\nthe practical efficiency of this procedure, while having an optimal worse-case\ncomplexity. We show how our generic scheme can be adapted for smoothing\ntechniques, and perform numerical experiments on large scale eigenvalue\nminimization problems.

The interface between\nthe lower solar atmosphere where energy is generated by subsurface convection\nand the corona comprises the chromosphere, which is dominated by jet-like,\ndynamic structures, called mottles when found in quiet regions, fibrils when\nfound in active regions and spicules when observed at the solar limb. Recently,\nspace observations with Hinode have led to the suggestion that there should\nexist two different types of spicules called Type I and Type II which have\ndifferent properties. Ground-based observations in the Ca II H and K\nfiltergrams reveal the existence of long, thin emission features called straws\nin observations close to the limb, and a class of short-lived events called\nrapid blue-shifted excursions characterized by large Doppler shifts that appear\nonly in the blue wing of the Ca II infrared line. It has been suggested that\nthe key to understanding how the solar plasma is accelerated and heated may\nwell be found in the studies of these jet-like, dynamic events. However, while\nthese structures are observed and studied for more than 130 years in the\nvisible, but also in the UV and EUV emission lines and continua, there are\nstill many questions to be answered.

In\nthe optical-UV band, several results indicate that there is a contribution from\na QSO-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jet\nemission. The unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation from\nthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. We estimate its\nbrightness to be R(QSO) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisation\ndegree. We find no clear correlation between the optical and radio light\ncurves, while the correlation between the optical and \\gamma-ray flux\napparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \\gamma-ray\nflux ratio. As suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4C\n38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where different\nemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,\nleading to variations in the Doppler factor \\delta. Under the hypothesis that\nin the period 2008-2011 all the \\gamma-ray and optical variability on a\none-week timescale were due to changes in \\delta, this would range between ~ 7\nand ~ 21.

We are\naiming at describing the first steps of the emergence of an active region\nwithin a pre-existing quiet-Sun corona in terms of the thermal and magnetic\nstructure.

The active region 11076 can be considered as\na peculiar example of emerging active region as (i) the polarities emerge in a\nphotospheric quiet-Sun region near a supergranular-like distribution, (ii) the\npolarities forming the bipolar emerging structure do not rotate with respect to\neach other indicating a small amount of twist in the emerging flux bundle.\nThere is a thermal shield formed at the interface between the emerging active\nregion and the pre-existing quiet-Sun region.

We include a\nself-consistent representation of the water cycle, with atmosphere-surface\ninteractions, atmospheric transport, and the radiative effects of CO2 and H2O\ngas and clouds taken into account. We find that for atmospheric pressures\ngreater than a fraction of a bar, the adiabatic cooling effect causes\ntemperatures in the southern highland valley network regions to fall\nsignificantly below the global average. Long-term climate evolution simulations\nindicate that in these circumstances, water ice is transported to the highlands\nfrom low-lying regions for a wide range of orbital obliquities, regardless of\nthe extent of the Tharsis bulge. In addition, an extended water ice cap forms\non the southern pole, approximately corresponding to the location of the\nNoachian/Hesperian era Dorsa Argentea Formation. Even for a multiple-bar CO2\natmosphere, conditions are too cold to allow long-term surface liquid water.\nLimited melting occurs on warm summer days in some locations, but only for\nsurface albedo and thermal inertia conditions that may be unrealistic for water\nice. Nonetheless, meteorite impacts and volcanism could potentially cause\nintense episodic melting under such conditions. Because ice migration to higher\naltitudes is a robust mechanism for recharging highland water sources after\nsuch events, we suggest that this globally sub-zero, `icy highlands' scenario\nfor the late Noachian climate may be sufficient to explain most of the fluvial\ngeology without the need to invoke additional long-term warming mechanisms or\nan early warm, wet Mars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 13:56:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Nov 2012 16:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-26"}

Together, these\nissues mean that the usual model-selection criteria do not work properly for\nnetworks. We illustrate these challenges, and show one way to resolve them, by\nconsidering the key network-analysis problem of dividing a graph into\ncommunities or blocks of nodes with homogeneous patterns of links to the rest\nof the network. The standard tool for doing this is the stochastic block model,\nunder which the probability of a link between two nodes is a function solely of\nthe blocks to which they belong. This imposes a homogeneous degree distribution\nwithin each block; this can be unrealistic, so degree-corrected block models\nadd a parameter for each node, modulating its over-all degree. The choice\nbetween ordinary and degree-corrected block models matters because they make\nvery different inferences about communities. We present the first principled\nand tractable approach to model selection between standard and degree-corrected\nblock models, based on new large-graph asymptotics for the distribution of\nlog-likelihood ratios under the stochastic block model, finding substantial\ndepartures from classical results for sparse graphs. We also develop\nlinear-time approximations for log-likelihoods under both the stochastic block\nmodel and the degree-corrected model, using belief propagation. Applications to\nsimulated and real networks show excellent agreement with our approximations.\nOur results thus both solve the practical problem of deciding on degree\ncorrection, and point to a general approach to model selection in network\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 13:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2013 18:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-25"}

Methods: From the PPMXL\ncatalogue of positions and proper motions we took the subset of stars with\nnear-infrared photometry from 2MASS and added the remaining 2MASS stars without\nproper motions (called 2MAst, i.e. 2MASS with astrometry). We developed a\ndata-processing pipeline including interactive human control of a standardised\nset of multi-dimensional diagrams to determine kinematic and photometric\nmembership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. The pipeline\nsimultaneously produced the astrophysical parameters of a cluster. From\nliterature we compiled a target list of presently known open and globular\nclusters, cluster candidates, associations, and moving groups. From established\nmember stars we derived spatial parameters (coordinates of centres and radii of\nthe main morphological parts of clusters) and cluster kinematics (average\nproper motions and sometimes radial velocities). For distance, reddening, and\nage determination we used specific sets of theoretical isochrones. Tidal\nparameters were obtained by a fit of three-parameter King profiles to the\nobserved density distributions of members. Results: We investigated all 871\nobjects in the 2nd Galactic quadrant, of which we successfully treated 642 open\nclusters, 2 globular clusters, and 8 stellar associations.

One of the SZ candidates detected in\nthe early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,\nPLCKG214.6+37.0, was later revealed by XMM-Newton to be a triple system of\ngalaxy clusters. We have further investigated this puzzling system with a\nmulti-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deep\nXMM-Newton re-observation. The characterisation of the physical properties of\nthe three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract the\ntotal SZ signal of this system with Planck data. We partly reconciled the\ndiscrepancy between the expected SZ signal from X-rays and the observed one,\nwhich are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. We measured the redshift of\nthe three components with the iron lines in the X-ray spectrum, and confirmed\nthat the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. The\nanalysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absence\nof detectable excess X-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing the\nformation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 14:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Using a sample of eight different cold nuclear\nphysics equations of state, we have computed models of maximum field strength,\nas well as the distortion coefficients for the surface and the quadrupolar\ndeformations. Surprisingly, we find that non-rotating models admit arbitrary\nlevels of magnetization, accompanied by a growth of size and quadrupole\ndistortion to which we could not find a limit. Rotating models, on the other\nhand, are subject to a mass-shedding limit at frequencies well below the\ncorresponding ones for unmagnetized stars. Overall, the space of solutions can\nbe split into three distinct classes for which the surface deformation and the\nquadrupole distortion are either prolate and prolate, oblate and prolate, or\noblate and oblate, respectively. We also derive a simple formula expressing the\nrelativistic distortion coefficients, which allows one to compute the surface\ndeformation and the quadrupole distortion up to significant levels of rotation\nand magnetization, essentially covering all known magnetars. Such a formula\nreplaces Newtonian equivalent expressions that overestimate the magnetic\nquadrupole distortion by about a factor of 6 and are inadequate for strongly\nrelativistic objects like neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 15:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 19:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-14"}
