As a consequence, separated parts of the source will contribute\nto fringe packets that are not fully overlapping; it is a transition from the\nclassical interferometric regime to a double or multiple fringe packet. While\nstudied in radio interferometry, there has been little work on the matter in\nthe optical, where observables are measured and derived in a different manner,\nand are more strongly impacted by the turbulent atmosphere.

For this to be effective, the theoretical model must be understood to at\nleast the same level of precision. A range of subtle relativistic effects\nremain to be explored theoretically, and offer the potential for probing\ngeneral relativity in this new regime. We present the distance-redshift\nrelation to second order in cosmological perturbation theory for a general dark\nenergy model. This relation determines the magnification of sources at high\nprecision, as well as redshift space distortions in the mildly non-linear\nregime. We identify a range of new lensing effects, including:\ndouble-integrated and nonlinear integrated Sach-Wolfe contributions, transverse\nDoppler effects, lensing from the induced vector mode and gravitational wave\nbackgrounds, in addition to lensing from the second-order potential.\nModifications to Doppler lensing from redshift-space distortions are\nidentified. Finally, we find a new double-coupling between the density\nfluctuations integrated along the line of sight, and gradients in the density\nfluctuations coupled to transverse velocities along the line of sight. These\ncan be large and thus offer important new probes of gravitational lensing and\ngeneral relativity.

To do\nthis, we used a standard equilibrium tidal model to compute the orbital\nevolution of single planets orbiting both Sun-like stars and 0.1 M\\odot\nM-dwarfs. We tested two stellar spin evolution profiles, one with fast initial\nrotation (P=1.2 day) and one with slow initial rotation (P=8 day). We tested\nthe effect of varying the stellar and planetary dissipation and the planet's\nmass and initial orbital radius. Conclusions: Tidal evolution allows to\ndifferentiate the early behaviors of extremely close-in planets orbiting either\na rapidly rotating star or a slowly rotating star. The early spin-up of the\nstar allows the close-in planets around fast rotators to survive the early\nevolution. For planets around M-dwarfs, surviving the early evolution means\nsurviving on Gyr timescales whereas for Sun-like stars the spin-down brings\nabout late mergers of Jupiter planets. In light of this study, we can say that\ndifferentiating between one spin evolution from another given the present\nposition of planets can be very tricky. Unless we can observe some markers of\nformer evolution it is nearly impossible to distinguish the two very different\nspin profiles, let alone intermediate spin profiles. Though some conclusions\ncan still be drawn from statistical distributions of planets around fully\nconvective M-dwarfs. However, if the tidal evolution brings about a merger late\nin its history it can also entail a noticeable acceleration of the star in late\nages, so that it is possible to have old stars that spin rapidly.

In this paper, we present an optical campaign of imaging plus\nspectroscopy on selected candidate counterparts of this object. We also\nreanalyzed the available archival X-ray data collected with XMM-Newton. We find\nthat the brightest optical source inside the 90% X-ray positional error circle\nis spectroscopically identified as a magnetic cataclysmic variable (CV), most\nlikely of intermediate polar type, through the detection of prominent Balmer,\nHe I, He II, and Bowen blend emissions. On either spectroscopic or statistical\ngrounds, we discard as counterparts of the X-ray source the other optical\nobjects in the XMM-Newton error circle. A red giant star of spectral type M5\nIII is found lying just outside the X-ray position: we consider this latter\nobject as a fore-/background one and likewise rule it out as a counterpart of\n1RXS J180431.1-273932.

Finally, even\ngreater probability of extreme wave formation is predicted when linear and\nnonlinear effects are acting together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2012 20:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-11"}

Most star-forming cluster sources (~90%) have characteristic\ndust temperatures similar to local field galaxies of comparable infrared (IR)\nluminosity (T_dust ~ 30K). Several sub-LIRG (L_IR < 10^11 L_sun) Bullet Cluster\nmembers are much warmer (T_dust > 37K) with far-infrared spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) shapes resembling LIRG-type local templates. X-ray and\nmid-infrared data suggest that obscured active galactic nuclei do not\ncontribute significantly to the infrared flux of these \"warm dust\" galaxies.\nSources of comparable IR-luminosity and dust temperature are not observed in\nthe relaxed cluster MS2137, although the significance is too low to speculate\non an origin involving recent cluster merging. \"Warm dust\" galaxies are,\nhowever, statistically rarer in field samples (> 3sigma), indicating that the\nresponsible mechanism may relate to the dense environment. The spatial\ndistribution of these sources is similar to the whole far-infrared bright\npopulation, i.e. preferentially located in the cluster periphery, although the\ngalaxy hosts tend towards lower stellar masses (M_* < 10^10 M_sun). We propose\ndust stripping and heating processes which could be responsible for the\nunusually warm characteristic dust temperatures. A normal star-forming galaxy\nwould need 30-50% of its dust removed (preferentially stripped from the outer\nreaches, where dust is typically cooler) to recover a SED similar to a \"warm\ndust\" galaxy. These progenitors would not require a higher IR-luminosity or\ndust mass than the currently observed normal star-forming population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2012 20:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In this article, we\nconstruct two new equations of state which match recent neutron star\nobservations and provide more flexibility in studying the dependence on nuclear\nmatter properties. The equations of state are also provided in tabular form,\ncovering a wide range in density, temperature and asymmetry, suitable for\nastrophysical simulations. These new equations of state are implemented into\nour spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model, which is based on\ngeneral relativistic radiation hydrodynamics with three-flavor Boltzmann\nneutrino transport. The results are compared with commonly used equations of\nstate in supernova simulations of 15 and 40 solar mass progenitors.

Using pulse arrival times that have been\ncorrected for the observed periodic dispersion measure changes, we find a\ntiming solution spanning 1997 November to 2011 March. This includes\nmeasurements of the advance of periastron and the change in the projected\nsemimajor axis of the orbit and sets constraints on the orbital geometry. From\nthese constraints, we estimate that the pulsar received a kick of at least ~50\nkm/s at birth. A quasi-periodic signal is present in the timing residuals with\na period of 2.2 times the binary orbital period. The origin of this signal is\nunclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 01:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Although the study is motivated by medical imaging\napplication, we obtain a solution of a general problem of Laplace deconvolution\nbased on noisy data which appears in many different contexts. We propose a new\nmethod for Laplace deconvolution which is based on expansions of the\nconvolution kernel, the unknown function and the observed signal over Laguerre\nfunctions basis. The expansion results in a small system of linear equations\nwith the matrix of the system being triangular and Toeplitz. The number $m$ of\nthe terms in the expansion of the estimator is controlled via complexity\npenalty. The advantage of this methodology is that it leads to very fast\ncomputations, does not require exact knowledge of the kernel and produces no\nboundary effects due to extension at zero and cut-off at $T$. The technique\nleads to an estimator with the risk within a logarithmic factor of $m$ of the\noracle risk under no assumptions on the model and within a constant factor of\nthe oracle risk under mild assumptions. The methodology is illustrated by a\nfinite sample simulation study which includes an example of the kernel obtained\nin the real life DCE experiments.

In the case of a correlated random walk,\nthe next step has the same sign as the previous one with a probability $q \\neq\n1/2$. We extend this model to an inhomogeneous ensemble of random walkers with\na given distribution of persistence probabilites $p(q)$ and show that\nremarkable statistical properties can result from this inhomogenity: Depending\non the distribution $p(q)$, we find that the probability density $p(\\Delta x,\n\\Delta t)$ for a displacement $\\Delta x$ after lagtime $\\Delta t$ can have a\nleptocurtic shape and that mean squared displacements can increase\napproximately like a fractional powerlaw with $\\Delta t$. For the special case\nof persistence parameters distributed equally in the full range $q \\in [0,1]$,\nthe mean squared displacement is derived analytically. The model is further\nextended by allowing different step lengths $\\delta x_j$ for each member $j$ of\nthe ensemble.

The simple, process-based Vaganov-Shashkin-Lite (VS-Lite) code\ncalculates tree growth responses controlled by a limited number of climatic\nparameters. Growth limitation by different ambient climate conditions allows\nfor possible nonlinearity and non-stationarity in the pseudo tree growth\nseries. Statistical reconstructions of temperature are achieved from simulated\ntree growth for random selections of pseudo-proxy locations by simple local\nregression and composite plus scaling techniques to address additional\nambiguities in paleoclimate reconstructions besides the known uncertainty and\nshortcomings of the reconstruction methods. A systematic empirical evaluation\nshows that the interrelations between simulated target and reconstructed\ntemperatures undergo strong variations with possibly pronounced\nmisrepresentations of temperatures. Thus (i) centennial scale inter-annual\ncorrelations can be very weak; (ii) the decadal range of reconstructed\ntemperatures may be as large as the range of the temperature variations over\nthe considered time-period; (iii) decadal variability is under-represented in\nthe reconstructions. The misrepresentations are in part due to the temporally\nvarying temperature-growth relations and to an apparent lack of decadal scale\nvariability in the simulated pseudo-growth series compared to the local\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 09:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-11"}

Significant negative F850LP-F160W color gradients have been\ndetected in ~70% of our sample within the effective radius R_e, the remaining\n30% having a flat color profile. Extending the analysis at R>R_e we have found\nthat the fraction of high-z ETGs with negative F850LP-F160W color gradients\nrises up to 100%. For each galaxy, we investigate the origin of the radial\ncolor variation with a technique based on the matching of both the spatially\nresolved color and the global spectral energy distribution (SED) to predictions\nof composite stellar population models. In fact, we find that the age of the\nstellar populations is the only parameter whose radial variation alone can\nfully account for the observed color gradients and global SEDs for half of the\ngalaxies in our sample (6 ETGs), without the need of radial variation of any\nother stellar population property. For four out of these six ETGs, a pure\nmetallicity variation can also reproduce the detected color gradients.\nNonetheless, a minor contribution to the observed color gradients from radial\nvariation of star-formation time scale, abundance of low-to-high mass stars and\ndust cannot be completely ruled out.

Motivated by this we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to examine\nboth even and odd dimensional CFTs. We find that in even dimensions, by\npromoting the cut-off to a field, one can get an action for this field which\ncoincides with the WZ action in flat space. In three dimensions, we observe\nthat by finding an exact Hamilton-Jacobi counterterm, one can find a\nnon-polynomial action which is invariant under global Weyl rescalings. We\ncomment on how this finding is tied up with the F-theorem conjectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 12:38:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 07:18:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 10:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 06:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

We present a class of sparse\nmatrices A, and a corresponding algorithm that we call SHO-FA (for Short and\nFast) that, with high probability over A, can reconstruct x from Ax. The SHO-FA\nalgorithm is related to the Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables recently introduced\nby Goodrich et al., with two important distinctions - SHO-FA relies on linear\nmeasurements, and is robust to noise. The SHO-FA algorithm is the first to\nsimultaneously have the following properties: (a) it requires only O(k)\nmeasurements, (b) the bit-precision of each measurement and each arithmetic\noperation is O (log(n) + P) (here 2^{-P} is the desired relative error in the\nreconstruction of x), (c) the decoding complexity is O(k) arithmetic operations\nand encoding complexity is O(n) arithmetic operations, and (d) if the\nreconstruction goal is simply to recover a single component of x instead of all\nof x, with significant probability over A this can be done in constant time.\nAll constants above are independent of all problem parameters other than the\ndesired success probability. For a wide range of parameters these properties\nare information-theoretically order-optimal. In addition, our SHO-FA algorithm\nworks over fairly general ensembles of \"sparse random matrices\", is robust to\nrandom noise, and (random) approximate sparsity for a large range of k. In\nparticular, suppose the measured vector equals A(x+z)+e, where z and e\ncorrespond respectively to the source tail and measurement noise. Under\nreasonable statistical assumptions on z and e our decoding algorithm\nreconstructs x with an estimation error of O(||z||_2 +||e||_2). The SHO-FA\nalgorithm works with high probability over A, z, and e, and still requires only\nO(k) steps and O(k) measurements over O(log n)-bit numbers. This is in contrast\nto the worst-case z model, where it is known O(k log n/k) measurements are\nnecessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 13:01:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Nov 2012 04:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-16"}

These\nsystems give rise to a class of one-sided infinite sequences, called PD0L\nwords.\n  We construct a PD0L word with exponential subword complexity, thereby\nanswering a question raised by Lepisto (1993) on the existence of such words.\nWe solve another open problem concerning the decidability of the first-order\ntheories of PD0L words; we show it is already undecidable whether a certain\nletter occurs in a PD0L word. This stands in sharp contrast to the situation\nfor D0L words (purely morphic words), which are known to have at most quadratic\nsubword complexity, and for which the monadic theory is decidable.\n  The main result of our paper, leading to these answers, is that every\ncomputable word w over an alphabet Sigma can be embedded in a PD0L word u over\nan extended alphabet Gamma in the following two ways: (i) such that every\nfinite prefix of w is a subword of u, and (ii) such that w is obtained from u\nby erasing all letters from Gamma not in Sigma. The PD0L system generating such\na word u is constructed by encoding a Fractran program that computes the word\nw; Fractran is a programming language as powerful as Turing Machines.\n  As a consequence of (ii), if we allow the application of finite state\ntransducers to PD0L words, we obtain the set of all computable words. Thus the\nset of PD0L words is not closed under finite state transduction, whereas the\nset of D0L words is. It moreover follows that equality of PD0L words (given by\ntheir PD0L system) is undecidable. Finally, we show that if erasing morphisms\nare admitted, then the question of productivity becomes undecidable, that is,\nthe question whether a given PD0L system defines an infinite word.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 13:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-11"}

A rigid\nsphere is coated with a wetting liquid, and then wrapped by a thin film into an\ninitially cylindrical shape. The equilibrium of this cylindrical shape is\ngoverned by the antagonistic effects of elasticity and capillarity: elasticity\ntends to keep the film developable while capillarity tends to curve it in both\ndirections so as to maximize the area of contact with the sphere. In the\nexperiments, the contact area between the film and the sphere has cylindrical\nsymmetry when the sphere radius is small, but destabilises to a non-symmetric,\nwrinkled configuration when the radius is larger than a critical value.

For a\none-component Bose gas this approximation has the following properties: the\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phase transition is second order but the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ is not shifted from the non-interacting gas value\n$T_0$. The spectrum of excitations in the BEC phase resembles the Bogoliubov\ndispersion with the usual coupling constant replaced by the running coupling\nconstant which depends on both temperature and momentum. We then study\ntwo-component Bose gases with both inter- and intra- species interactions and\nfocus on the stability of the mixture state above $T_c$. Our mean-field\napproximation predicts an instability from the mixture state to a\nphase-separated state when the ratio of the inter-species interaction strength\nto the intra-species interaction strength (assuming equal strength for both\nspecies) exceeds a critical value. At high temperature this is a structural\ntransition and the global translational symmetry is broken. Our work\ncomplements previous studies on the instability of the mixture phase in the\npresence of BEC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 15:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-05"}

It is\nfound that inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions in the two methods\nresults in significant increases in intra- or inter-ring exciton transfer\nefficiency. The dependence of exciton transfer efficiency on trapping positions\non single rings of LH2 (B850) and LH1 is similar to that in toy models with\nnearest-neighbor coupling only. However, owing to the symmetry breaking caused\nby the dimerization of BChls and dipolar couplings, such dependence has been\nlargely suppressed. In the studies of coupled-ring systems, both methods reveal\ninteresting role of dipolar interaction in increasing energy transfer\nefficiency by introducing multiple intra/inter-ring transfer paths.\nImportantly, the time scale (~4ps) of inter-ring exciton transfer obtained from\npolaron dynamics is in good agreement with previous studies. In a double-ring\nLH2 system, dipole-induced symmetry breaking leads to global minima and local\nminima of the average trapping time when there is a finite value of non-zero\ndephasing rate, suggesting that environment plays a role in preserving quantum\ncoherent energy transfer. In contrast, dephasing comes into play only when the\nperfect cylindrical symmetry in the hypothetic system is broken. This study has\nrevealed that dipolar interaction between chromophores may play an important\npart in the high energy transfer efficiency in the LH2 system and many other\nnatural photosynthetic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 15:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}
