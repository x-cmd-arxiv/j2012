The theory allows the systematic estimation\nerrors made by standard rate theories to be understood and quantified. We also\nelucidate the connection of spectral rate theory with the popular Markov state\nmodeling (MSM) approach for molecular simulation studies. An optimal rate\nestimator is formulated that gives robust and unbiased results even for poor\nreaction coordinates and can be applied to both computer simulations and\nsingle-molecule experiments. No definition of a dividing surface is required.\nAnother result of the theory is a model-free definition of the reaction\ncoordinate quality (RCQ). The RCQ can be bounded from below by the directly\ncomputable observation quality (OQ), thus providing a measure allowing the RCQ\nto be optimized by tuning the experimental setup. Additionally, the respective\npartial probability distributions can be obtained for the reactant and product\nstates along the observed order parameter, even when these strongly overlap.\nThe effects of both filtering (averaging) and uncorrelated noise are also\nexamined.

The problem has been studied and solved even for robots that are\nanonymous, disoriented, memoryless and operate in the semi-synchronous (ATOM)\nmodel. However all known solutions require the robots to be faulty-free except\nfor the results of [Agmon and Peleg 2006] who solve the gathering problem in\npresence of one crash fault. This leaves open the question of whether gathering\nof correct robots can be achieved in the presence of multiple crash failures.\nWe resolve the question in this paper and show how to solve gathering, when any\nnumber of robots may crash at any time during the algorithm, assuming strong\nmultiplicity detection and chirality. In contrast it is known that for the more\nstronger byzantine faults, it is impossible to gather even in a 3-robot system\nif one robot is faulty. Our algorithm solves the gathering of correct robots in\nthe semi-synchronous model where an adversary may stop any robot before\nreaching its desired destination.

In\ncontrast to the traditional problem of a wind affecting a body with a\nprescribed magnetic field, we investigate how a non-magnetized wind flow\naffects a magnetic field that is being self-excited by galactic dynamo action.\nIn order to isolate the leading physical effects we exploit a simple dynamo\nmodel that can describe relevant effects. In particular, we use what is known\nas the 'no-z' approximation for the mean-field dynamo equations. In a suitable\nparametric range we obtain displacements of the large-scale magnetic field, as\nwell as magnetic tails. However, the specific details of their locations are\nquite counterintuitive. The direction of displacement is perpendicular to,\nrather than parallel to, the wind direction. The point at which the tail\nemerges from the galaxy depends on details of the model. The tail is eventually\ndirected downstream. In the simplest case the magnetic tail begins in the\nregion where the wind decreases the total gas velocity. Any wind that\npenetrates the galaxy modifies the intrinsic dynamo action. These features are\ndifferent from those found in ram-pressure models. Any determination of\ngalactic motion through the cluster medium from observational data needs to\ntake the effects of dynamo action into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jul 2012 19:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The reconstruction\nmethod is based on expansions of the general interaction term and the relevant\ncosmological variables in terms of Chebyshev polynomials which form a complete\nset orthonormal functions.

The main outcome of this analysis is that the distributed\ncomputing setting contrasts significantly with the sequential one as far as\nrandomization is concerned. Indeed, we prove that in some cases, the ability to\nincrease the success probability for deciding distributed languages is rather\nlimited. Informally, a (p,q)-decider for a language L is a distributed\nrandomized algorithm which accepts instances in L with probability at least p\nand rejects instances outside of L with probability at least q. It is known\nthat every hereditary language that can be decided in t rounds by a\n(p,q)-decider, where p^2+q>1, can actually be decided deterministically in O(t)\nrounds. In one of our results we give evidence supporting the conjecture that\nthe above statement holds for all distributed languages. This is achieved by\nconsidering the restricted case of path topologies. We then turn our attention\nto the range below the aforementioned threshold, namely, the case where\np^2+q\\leq1. We define B_k(t) to be the set of all languages decidable in at\nmost t rounds by a (p,q)-decider, where p^{1+1/k}+q>1. It is easy to see that\nevery language is decidable (in zero rounds) by a (p,q)-decider satisfying\np+q=1. Hence, the hierarchy B_k provides a spectrum of complexity classes\nbetween determinism and complete randomization.

A dominant theoretical and algorithmic framework for\nthe problem has been to reduce bipartite ranking to pairwise classification; in\nparticular, it is well known that the bipartite ranking regret can be\nformulated as a pairwise classification regret, which in turn can be upper\nbounded using usual regret bounds for classification problems. Recently,\nKotlowski et al. (2011) showed regret bounds for bipartite ranking in terms of\nthe regret associated with balanced versions of the standard (non-pairwise)\nlogistic and exponential losses. In this paper, we show that such\n(non-pairwise) surrogate regret bounds for bipartite ranking can be obtained in\nterms of a broad class of proper (composite) losses that we term as strongly\nproper. Our proof technique is much simpler than that of Kotlowski et al.\n(2011), and relies on properties of proper (composite) losses as elucidated\nrecently by Reid and Williamson (2010, 2011) and others. Our result yields\nexplicit surrogate bounds (with no hidden balancing terms) in terms of a\nvariety of strongly proper losses, including for example logistic, exponential,\nsquared and squared hinge losses as special cases.

This paper reports an\nanalysis of these effects on the MI by considering a linear-birefringence TCF\nand a circular-birefringence TCF, which feature different XPM coefficients. The\nanalysis focuses on the MI of the asymmetric CW states in the TCFs, which have\nno counterparts in single-core fibers.

Several variations of their\ncurvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or\nthe machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of\nseveral parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of\nshapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure\nparts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several\ndeep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High\nSpeed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity\nlevel because of the shapes' geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is\ngenerally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be\nsufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to\nan important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the\nCAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise\nchoice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for\nprismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely\nimplemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds\nof CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging\ndies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining\nareas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these\nareas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining\npreparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of\ncomplex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas\nextracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models\nof the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant\nduring machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he\ncarried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is\nbased on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which\nrepresent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical\nfeatures which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the\nidentification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper.\nDetailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging\ndies is presented in the last part of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 06:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

Our analysis, like all previous analysis of this\nproblem, shows that the globule behaves essentially differently in two modes of\nextension. In the force-clamp mode, mechanical unfolding of the globule with\nincreasing applied force occurs without intramolecular microphase segregation,\nand at certain threshold value of the pulling force the globule unfolds as a\nwhole (\"all-or-none\" transition). The value of the threshold force and the\ncorresponding jump in the distance between the chain ends increase with a\ndeterioration of the solvent quality and/or with an increase in the degree of\npolymerization. In the position-clamp mode, the globule unfolding occurs via\nintramolecular microphase coexistence of globular and extended microphases\nfollowed by an abrupt unraveling transition. Reaction force in the microphase\nsegregation regime demonstrates an \"anomalous\" decrease with increasing\nextension. Comparison of deformation curves in force and position-clamp modes\ndemonstrates that at weak and strong extensions the curves for two modes\ncoincide, differences are observed in the intermediate extension range. Another\nunfolding scenario is typical for short globules: in both modes of extension\nthey unfold continuously, without jumps or intramolecular microphase\ncoexistence, by passing a sequence of uniformly elongated configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 07:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

ALPs\ncan give rise to observable effects in very-high-energy astrophysics. Above\nroughly 100 GeV the horizon of the observable Universe progressively shrinks as\nthe energy increases, due to scattering of beam photons off background photons\nin the optical and infrared bands, which produces e+e- pairs. In the presence\nof large-scale magnetic fields photons emitted by a blazar can oscillate into\nALPs on the way to us and back into photons before reaching the Earth. Since\nALPs do not interact with background photons, the effective mean free path of\nbeam photons increases, enhancing the photon survival probability. While the\nabsorption probability increases with energy, photon-ALP oscillations are\nenergy-independent, and so the survival probability increases with energy\ncompared to standard expectations. We have performed a systematic analysis of\nthis effect, interpreting the present data on very-high-energy photons from\nblazars. Our predictions can be tested with presently operating Cherenkov\nTelescopes like H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS and CANGAROO III as well as with\ndetectors like ARGO-YBJ and MILAGRO and with the planned Cherenkov Telescope\nArray and the HAWC-ray observatory.

Our simulation\nsample focuses on galaxies with present-day stellar masses in the 10^10-10^11\nMsun range, in field and loose group environments, with a broad variety of mass\ngrowth histories. In our models, bars are almost absent from the progenitors of\npresent-day spirals at z>1.5, and they remain rare and generally too weak to be\nobservable down to z~1. After this characteristic epoch, the fractions of\nobservable and strong bars raise rapidly, bars being present in 80% of spiral\ngalaxies and easily observable in two thirds of these at z<0.5. This is\nquantitatively consistent with the redshift evolution of the observed bar\nfraction. Our models predict that the decrease in the bar fraction with\nincreasing redshift should continue with a fraction of observable bars <10-15%\nin disk galaxies at z>1. Our models also predict later bar formation in\nlower-mass galaxies, in agreement with existing data. We find that the\ncharacteristic epoch of bar formation, namely redshift z~0.8-1, corresponds to\nthe epoch at which today's spirals acquire their disk-dominated morphology. At\nhigher redshift, disks tend to be rapidly destroyed by mergers and\ngravitational instabilities and rarely develop significant bars. The bar\nformation epoch corresponds to the transition between an early \"violent\" phase\nof spiral galaxy formation at z>1 and a late \"secular\" phase at z<0.8. In the\nsecular phase, the presence of bars substantially contributes to the growth of\nthe bulge, but the bulge mass budget remains statistically dominated by the\ncontribution of mergers, interactions and disk instabilities at high redshift.\nEarly bars at z>1 are often short-lived, while most of the bars formed at z<1\npersist down to z=0, late cosmological gas infall being necessary to maintain\nsome of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 11:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Methods: The impact of\nrotational mixing and of the hydrostatic effects of rotation on lithium\nabundances are investigated by computing non-rotating and rotating PMS models\nthat include a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation. The influence of\nthe disc lifetime is then studied by comparing the lithium content of PMS\nrotating models experiencing different durations of the disc-locking phase\nbetween 3 and 9 Myr. Results: The surface lithium abundance at the end of the\nPMS is decreased when rotational effects are included. During the beginning of\nthe lithium depletion phase, only hydrostatic effects of rotation are at work.\nThis results in a decrease in the lithium depletion rate for rotating models\ncompared to non-rotating ones. When the convective envelope recedes from the\nstellar centre, rotational mixing begins to play an important role due to\ndifferential rotation near the bottom of the convective envelope. This mixing\nresults in a decrease in the surface lithium abundance with a limited\ncontribution from hydrostatic effects of rotation, which favours lithium\ndepletion during the second part of the PMS evolution. The impact of rotation\non PMS lithium depletion is also found to be sensitive to the duration of the\ndisc-locking phase. When the disc lifetime increases, the PMS lithium abundance\nof a solar-type star decreases owing to the higher efficiency of rotational\nmixing in the radiative zone. A relationship between the surface rotation and\nlithium abundance at the end of the PMS is then obtained: slow rotators on the\nzero-age main sequence are predicted to be more lithium-depleted than fast\nrotators due to the increase in the disc lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 13:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The concordance is\nexplicitely computed for many examples of surfaces, especially abelian surfaces\nwhich are broadly studied, as well as some K3 surfaces.\n  In the second part, we are interested in the Fatou set, which corresponds to\ncomplex points for which the dynamics is simple.

Since the threshold calculation depends on\nthe local connectivity, it can also be used to identify critical network\npartitions acting as synchronization bottlenecks. In our stability experiments\nwe observe that when a link removal triggers a change in the critical\npartition, its limits tend to converge to national borders. This phenomenon,\nwhich can have important consequences to synchronization dynamics in case of\ncascading failure, signals the influence of the uncomplete topological\nintegration of national power grids at the European scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 14:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

The matter comprised of\nhalf skyrmions has vanishing quark condensate but non-vanishing pion decay\nconstant and could be interpreted as a hadronic dual of strong-coupled quark\nmatter. We infer from this observation combined with certain predictions of\nhidden local symmetry in low-energy hadronic interactionsa a set of new scaling\nlaws -- called \"new-BR\" -- for the parameters in nuclear effective field theory\ncontrolled by renormalization-group flow. They are subjected to the EoS of\nsymmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, and are then applied to nuclear\nsymmetry energies and properties of compact stars. The changeover from the\nskyrmion matter to a half-skyrmion matter that takes place after the cross-over\ndensity $n_{1/2}$ provides a simple and natural field theoretic explanation for\nthe change of the EoS from soft to stiff at a density above that of nuclear\nmatter required for compact stars as massive as $\\sim 2.4M_\\odot$. Cross-over\ndensity in the range $1.5n_0 \\lsim n_{1/2} \\lsim 2.0 n_0$ has been employed,\nand the possible skyrmion half-skyrmion coexistence {or cross-over} near\n$n_{1/2}$ is discussed. The novel structure of {the tensor forces and} the EoS\nobtained with the new-BR scaling is relevant for neutron-rich nuclei and\ncompact star matter and could be studied in RIB (rare isotope beam) machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 15:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 10:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 May 2013 23:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

This had tragic consequences\nbecause it produced crippled model Hamiltonians, unfortunately considered\nsufficient for a description of solids including superconductors. From there,\nof course, Fr\\\"ohlich derived wrong effective Hamiltonian, from which incorrect\nBCS theory arose.\n  1) Mechanical and field patterns cannot be mixed. Instead of field methods\napplied to the mechanical Born-Oppenheimer approximation we have entirely to\navoid it and construct an independent and standalone field pattern. This leads\nto a new form of the Bohr's complementarity on the level of composite systems.\n  2) We have correctly to deal with the center of gravity, which is under the\nfield pattern \"materialized\" in the form of new quasipartiles - rotons and\ntranslons. This leads to a new type of relativity of internal and external\ndegrees of freedom and one-particle way of bypassing degeneracies (gap\nformation).\n  3) The possible symmetry cannot be apriori loaded but has to be aposteriori\nobtained as a solution of field equations, formulated in a general form without\ntranslational or any other symmetry. This leads to an utterly revised view of\nsymmetry breaking in non-adiabatic systems, namely Jahn-Teller effect and\nsuperconductivity.

These include an unusually low power at the largest\nscales and an apparent alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments. In\nLCDM, the quadrupole and octopole moments should be statistically independent.\nThese low probability features may simply be due to posterior selections from\nmany such possible effects. If this is not the case, however, their combined\nstatistical significance would be equal to the product of their individual\nsignificances. Ignoring the biasing due to posterior selection, the missing\nlarge-angle correlations would have a probability as low as ~0.1% and the low-l\nmultipole alignment would be unlikely at the ~4.9% level; under the least\nfavourable conditions, their simultaneous observation in the context of the\nstandard model could then be likely at only the ~0.005% level. In this paper,\nwe explore the possibility that these features are indeed anomalous, and show\nthat the corresponding probability of CMB multipole alignment in the R_h=ct\nUniverse would then be ~7-10%, depending on the number of large-scale\nSachs-Wolfe induced fluctuations. Since the low power at the largest spatial\nscales is reproduced in this cosmology without the need to invoke cosmic\nvariance, the overall likelihood of observing both of these features in the CMB\nis > 7%, much more likely than in LCDM.
