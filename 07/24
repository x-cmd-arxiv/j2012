Control\nsystems are widely used in critical infrastructures such as electric grid,\nnatural gas, water and wastewater industries. While control systems can be\nvulnerable to a variety of types of cyber attacks that could have devastating\nconsequences, little research has been done to secure the control systems.\nAmerican Gas Association (AGA), IEC TC57 WG15, IEEE, NIST and National SCADA\nTest Bed Program have been actively designing cryptographic standard to protect\nSCADA systems. American Gas Association (AGA) had originally been designing\ncryptographic standard to protect SCADA communication links and finished the\nreport AGA 12 part 1.

This attack shows that the security mechanisms\nin the first version of the AGA standard protocol could be easily defeated. We\nthen propose a suite of security protocols optimised for SCADA/DCS systems\nwhich include: point-to-point secure channels, authenticated broadcast\nchannels, authenticated emergency channels, and revised authenticated emergency\nchannels.

Hence it can be characterized from the point of\nview of communication theory, i.e., in terms of its ability to transfer\ninformation. Quantum information provides a theoretical framework and the\nproper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of\ncodes and communication capacities have been introduced by generalizing them\nfrom the classical Shannon theory of information transmission and error\ncorrection. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the\nchannel not as acting on a single system, but on sequences of systems, which,\nwhen properly initialized allow one to overcome the noisy effects induced by\nthe physical process under consideration. While most of the work produced so\nfar has been focused on the case in which a given channel transformation acts\nidentically and independently on the various elements of the sequence\n(memoryless configuration in jargon), correlated error models appear to be a\nmore realistic way to approach the problem. A slightly different, yet\nconceptually related, notion of correlated errors applies to a single quantum\nsystem which evolves continuously in time under the influence of an external\ndisturbance which acts on it in a non-Markovian fashion. This leads to the\nstudy of memory effects in quantum channels: a fertile ground where interesting\nnovel phenomena emerge at the intersection of quantum information theory and\nother branches of physics. A survey is taken of the field of quantum channels\ntheory while also embracing these specific and complex settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 16:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 19:00:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 18:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2013 14:52:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

We searched for particular changes in the Sun's acceleration and\nconcentrated on long-term variations of the solar cycle. We show how the\norbital angular momentum of the Sun evolves and how the inclination of the\nsolar barycentric orbit varies during the epochs of orbital retrogressions. In\nparticular, at these moments, the radial component of the Sun's acceleration\n(i.e., in the barycentre-Sun direction) had an exceptional magnitude. These\nradial impulses occurred at the very beginning of the Maunder Minimum, during\nthe Dalton Minimum and also at the maximum of cycle 22 before the present\nextended minimum.

They claimed\nthat in the ideal-cipher model (random oracles), the two-flow protocol at the\ncore of Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) is secure.

The blends\nobtained in this way have been characterized by 1H-NMR and DSC. A degree of\nrandomness of 0.38 and 0.26 has been found for the 90/10 and 70/30 copolymers.\nIt is shown by DSC that this copolimerization is enough to compatibilize the\nblends. The alpha relaxation, the dielectric manifestation of the glass\ntransition, has been studied by thermally stimulated depolarization currents\n(TSDC). The relaxation has been analyzed into its elementary modes by means of\na relaxation map analysis. The activation energies of the modes of the glass\ntransition do not change significantly between the four materials: in all cases\nthe modes with a larger contribution have around 3 eV and modes with less than\n1 eV are not detected. The change in the pre-exponential factor accounts\nentirely for the relaxation time change from material to material, that is\nlarger as the PEN content increases. The compensation law is fulfilled and\ncompensation plots converge for high-frequency modes. The polarizability\ndecreases as the PEN content increases due to the increased stiffness of the\npolymer backbone. An analysis of the cooperativity shows that the central modes\nof the distribution are the most cooperative while high-frequency modes tend to\nbehave more as Arrhenius. The low-frequency modes are difficult to study due to\nthe asymmetry of the distribution of relaxation times. PEN turns out to be the\nless cooperative material. It is demonstrated how the parameters obtained from\nthe dielectric study are able to reproduce calorimetric data from DSC scans and\nare, therefore, a valid description of the glass transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 16:56:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Oct 2012 14:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In order to\ndescribe these new effects some theories were adapted and some others have been\ntried. In this work we present an application of the fractional calculus to\nstudy the superconductor in the context of London theory. Here we investigated\nthe linear London equation modified by fractional derivatives for\nnon-differentiable functions, instead of integer ones, in a coarse grained\nscenario. We apply the fractional approach based in the modified\nRiemann-Liouville sense to improve the model in order to include possible\nnon-local interactions and the media.

In order to compare the present results with the usual London\ntheory, we calculated the magnetic field distribution for a mesoscopic\nsuperconductor system.

This\nleads to enhanced VBF signals of gamma gamma while keeping other signals of\nHiggses approximately constant (such as WW* and ZZ*), and suppressing higgs to\ntau tau.

Since the resulting polarization profile is\ninvariant upon inversion with respect to the wall center it does not brake the\nwall symmetry in contrast to the classical Bloch-type walls. The flexoelectric\ncoupling lower the domain wall energy and gives rise to its additional\nanisotropy that is comparable to that conditioned by the elastic anisotropy.\nThe atomic orderof- magnitude estimates shows that the new polarization\ncomponent P2 may be comparable with spontaneous polarization Ps, thus\nsuggesting that, in general, the flexoelectric coupling should be mandatory\nincluded in domain wall simulations in ferroelectrics. Calculations performed\nfor barium titanate yields the maximal value of the P2, which is much smaller\nthan that of the spontaneous polarization. This smallness is attributed to an\nanomalously small value of a component of the \"strain-polarization\"\nelecrostictive tensor in this material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 17:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

While a relatively minor addition, the\nphenomenological implications can be important. Such a field can be naturally\ncharged under an additional symmetry group $G_s$. If gauged, the Higgs mass is\nnaturally much larger than in the MSSM through an NMSSM-type interaction, but\nwith $\\Sigma_d$ playing the role of $H_d$. The addition of the sister Higgs\nallows new R-parity violating operators $\\Sigma_d H_d E$, which are less\nconstrained than conventional leptonic R-parity violation. Considerations of\nunification motivates the presence of colored $G_s$-charged fields. Production\nof these G-quarks can lead to new b-rich final states and modifications to\ndecays of gluinos, as well as new opportunities for R-parity violation. Unlike\na conventional fourth generation, G-quarks dominantly decay into a light jet\nand a scalar (potentially the Higgs), which then generally decays to b-jets.\nThe presence of additional sister charges allows the possibilities that\nlightest sister-charged particle (LSiP) could be stable. We consider the\npossibility of an LSiP dark matter candidate and find it is generally very\nconstrained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 20:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

There have also been\nextensive interests in applying LT code techniques to distributed storage\nsystems such as cloud data storage in recent years. However, Plank and\nThomason's experimental results show that LDPC code performs well only\nasymptotically when the number of data fragments increases and it has the worst\nperformance for small number of data fragments (e.g., less than 100). In their\nINFOCOM 2012 paper, Cao, Yu, Yang, Lou, and Hou proposed to use exhaustive\nsearch approach to find a deterministic LT code that could be used to decode\nthe original data content correctly in distributed storage systems. However, by\nPlank and Thomason's experimental results, it is not clear whether the\nexhaustive search approach will work efficiently or even correctly. This paper\ncarries out the theoretical analysis on the feasibility and performance issues\nfor applying LT codes to distributed storage systems. By employing the\nunderlying ideas of efficient Belief Propagation (BP) decoding process in LT\ncodes, this paper introduces two classes of codes called flat BP-XOR codes and\narray BP-XOR codes (which can be considered as a deterministic version of LT\ncodes). We will show the equivalence between the edge-colored graph model and\ndegree-one-and-two encoding symbols based array BP-XOR codes. Using this\nequivalence result, we are able to design general array BP-XOR codes using\ngraph based results. Similarly, based on this equivalence result, we are able\nto get new results for edge-colored graph models using results from array\nBP-XOR codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 21:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-25"}

Finally, since such typical\ndata-sets on the sphere are of considerable size and the directional SLSHT is\nintrinsically computationally demanding depending on the band-limits of the\nsignal and window, a fast algorithm for the efficient computation of the\ntransform is developed. The floating point precision numerical accuracy of the\nfast algorithm is demonstrated and a full numerical complexity analysis is\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jul 2012 23:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 16:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

In the case of strong frustration a nontrivial time-reversal-symmetry\nbreaking (TRSB) state, with nonzero phase angles between all gap parameters, is\npossible. In a more typical state, the s-wave order parameter is aligned with\none of the s+- gaps. The other (anti-aligned) gap induces negative feature in\nthe s-wave density of states, which can serve as a fingerprint of s+- state.\nAnother consequence of the frustration is an extended region in the parameter\nspace in which s-wave superconductivity is suppressed, despite being in contact\nwith nominally stronger superconductor. This negative proximity effect is\nalways present for the TRSB state, but extends even into the aligned states. We\nstudy these effects within a simple microscopic model assuming dirty limit in\nall bands, which allows us to model the system in terms of minimum number of\nthe most relevant parameters.

The argument is based on the existence of a sharp exponential\nultraviolet cutoff in momentum space on the eigenfunctions of the quantum\ncosmological dynamical evolution operator (the gravitational part of the\nHamiltonian constraint), attributable to the fundamental discreteness of\nspatial volume in loop quantum cosmology. The existence of the cutoff is proved\ndirectly from recently found exact solutions for the eigenfunctions for this\nmodel. As a consequence, the operators corresponding to the momentum of the\nscalar field and the spatial volume approximately commute. The ultraviolet\ncutoff then implies that the scalar momentum, though not a bounded operator, is\nin effect bounded on subspaces of constant volume, leading to the upper bound\non the expectation value of the matter density. The maximum matter density is\nuniversal (i.e. independent of the quantum state) because of the linear scaling\nof the cutoff with volume. These heuristic arguments are supplemented by a new\nproof in the volume representation of the existence of the maximum matter\ndensity. The techniques employed to demonstrate the existence of the cutoff\nalso allow us to extract the large volume limit of the exact eigenfunctions,\nconfirming earlier numerical and analytical work showing that the\neigenfunctions approach superpositions of the eigenfunctions of the\nWheeler-DeWitt quantization of the same model.

Motivated by these observations, we show how Doppler\nmeasurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. We show that\nthe atmospheric circulation--and Doppler signature--of hot Jupiters splits into\ntwo regimes. Under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcing\ngenerates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves with\nthe mean flow. In this regime, air along the terminator (as seen during\ntransit) flows toward Earth in some regions and away from Earth in others,\nleading to a Doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshifted\ncomponents. Under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermal\nforcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generate\njets. Strong frictional drag likewise damps these waves and inhibits jet\nformation. As a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated by\nhigh-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifted\nDoppler signature during transit. We present state-of-the-art circulation\nmodels including nongray radiative transfer to quantify this regime shift and\nthe resulting Doppler signatures; these models suggest that cool planets like\nGJ 436b lie in the first regime, HD 189733b is transitional, while planets\nhotter than HD 209458b lie in the second regime. Moreover, we show how the\namplitude of the Doppler shifts constrains the strength of frictional drag in\nthe upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters. If due to winds, the ~2-km/sec blueshift\ninferred on HD 209458b may require drag time constants as short as 10^4-10^6\nseconds, possibly the result of Lorentz-force braking on this planet's hot\ndayside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 09:55:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 16:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-12"}

This\nprovides mobiles practically infinite battery lives and eliminates the need of\npower cords and chargers. To enable MPT for mobile charging, this paper\nproposes a new network architecture that overlays an uplink cellular network\nwith randomly deployed PBs for powering mobiles, called a hybrid network. The\ndeployment of the hybrid network under an outage constraint on data links is\ninvestigated based on a stochastic-geometry model where single-antenna base\nstations (BSs) and PBs form independent homogeneous Poisson point processes\n(PPPs) and single-antenna mobiles are uniformly distributed in Voronoi cells\ngenerated by BSs. In this model, mobiles and PBs fix their transmission power\nat p and q, respectively; a PB either radiates isotropically, called isotropic\nMPT, or directs energy towards target mobiles by beamforming, called directed\nMPT. The model is applied to derive the tradeoffs between the network\nparameters including p, q, and the BS/PB densities under the outage constraint.\nFirst, consider the deployment of the cellular network. It is proved that the\noutage constraint is satisfied so long as the product the BS density decreases\nwith increasing p following a power law where the exponent is proportional to\nthe path-loss exponent. Next, consider the deployment of the hybrid network\nassuming infinite energy storage at mobiles. It is shown that for isotropic\nMPT, the product between q, the PB density, and the BS density raised to a\npower proportional to the path-loss exponent has to be above a given threshold\nso that PBs are sufficiently dense; for directed MPT, a similar result is\nobtained with the aforementioned product increased by the array gain.

It is likely that magnetic\nfields play a crucial role in the distribution of stellar masses inside\nstar-forming molecular clouds. In this context, we explore the effects of\nmagnetic fields, with a typical field strength of 38 microG, such as in RCW 38,\nand a field strength of 135 microG, similar to NGC 2024 and the infrared dark\ncloud G28.34+0.06, on the initial mass function (IMF) near (< 10 pc) a 10^7\nsolar mass black hole. Using these conditions, we perform a series of numerical\nsimulations with the hydrodynamical code FLASH to elucidate the impact of\nmagnetic fields on the IMF and the star-formation efficiency (SFE) emerging\nfrom an 800 solar mass cloud. We find that the collapse of a gravitationally\nunstable molecular cloud is slowed down with increasing magnetic field strength\nand that stars form along the field lines. The total number of stars formed\nduring the simulations increases by a factor of 1.5-2 with magnetic fields. The\nmain component of the IMF has a lognormal shape, with its peak shifted to\nsub-solar (< 0.3 M_sun) masses in the presence of magnetic fields, due to a\ndecrease in the accretion rates from the gas reservoir. In addition, we see a\ntop-heavy, nearly flat IMF above ~2 solar masses, from regions that were\nsupported by magnetic pressure until high masses are reached. We also consider\nthe effects of X-ray irradiation if the central black hole is active. X-ray\nfeedback inhibits the formation of sub-solar masses and decreases the SFEs even\nfurther. Thus, the second contribution is no longer visible. We conclude that\nmagnetic fields potentially change the SFE and the IMF both in active and\ninactive galaxies, and need to be taken into account in such calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 11:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 11:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-03"}

Introduced in 2000\nby Schein and Gallager, the capacity of this relay network is unknown in\ngeneral. The best currently available capacity approximation, independent of\nthe coefficients and the SNR's of the constituent channels, is within an\nadditive gap of 1.3 N bits, which follows from the recent capacity\napproximations for general Gaussian relay networks with arbitrary topology.\n  In this paper, we approximate the capacity of this network within 2 log N\nbits. We show that two strategies can be used to achieve the\ninformation-theoretic cutset upper bound on the capacity of the network up to\nan additive gap of O(log N) bits, independent of the channel configurations and\nthe SNR's. The first of these strategies is simple partial decode-and-forward.\nHere, the source node uses a superposition codebook to broadcast independent\nmessages to the relays at appropriately chosen rates; each relay decodes its\nintended message and then forwards it to the destination over the MAC channel.\nA similar performance can be also achieved with compress-and-forward type\nstrategies (such as quantize-map-and-forward and noisy network coding) that\nprovide the 1.3 N-bit approximation for general Gaussian networks, but only if\nthe relays quantize their observed signals at a resolution inversely\nproportional to the number of relay nodes N. This suggest that the\nrule-of-thumb to quantize the received signals at the noise level in the\ncurrent literature can be highly suboptimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 11:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 06:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2013 06:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

Ingroup favoritism is\nanother aspect of human cooperation, whereby individuals help members in their\nown group more often than those in other groups. Ingroup favoritism is a puzzle\nfor the theory of cooperation because it is not easily evolutionarily stable.\nIn the context of indirect reciprocity, ingroup favoritism has been shown to be\na consequence of employing a double standard when assigning reputations to\ningroup and outgroup members; e.g., helping an ingroup member is regarded as\ngood, whereas the same action toward an outgroup member is regarded as bad. We\nanalyze a model of indirect reciprocity in which information sharing is\nconducted groupwise. In our model, individuals play social dilemma games within\nand across groups, and the information about their reputations is shared within\neach group. We show that evolutionarily stable ingroup favoritism emerges even\nif all the players use the same reputation assignment rule regardless of group\n(i.e., a single standard). Two reputation assignment rules called simple\nstanding and stern judging yield ingroup favoritism. Stern judging induces much\nstronger ingroup favoritism than does simple standing. Simple standing and\nstern judging are evolutionarily stable against each other when groups\nemploying different assignment rules compete and the number of groups is\nsufficiently large. In addition, we analytically show as a limiting case that\nhomogeneous populations of reciprocators that use reputations are unstable when\nindividuals independently infer reputations of individuals, which is consistent\nwith previously reported numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 11:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Nov 2012 11:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

For stochastic differential equations\n(SDE's) time discretization numerical schemes usually destroy the property of\ntime-reversibility. Despite an extensive literature on the numerical analysis\nfor SDE's, their stability properties, strong and/or weak error estimates,\nlarge deviations and infinite-time estimates, no quantitative results are known\non the lack of reversibility of the discrete-time approximation process. In\nthis paper we provide such quantitative estimates by using the concept of\nentropy production rate, inspired by ideas from non-equilibrium statistical\nmechanics. The entropy production rate for a stochastic process is defined as\nthe relative entropy (per unit time) of the path measure of the process with\nrespect to the path measure of the time-reversed process. By construction the\nentropy production rate is nonnegative and it vanishes if and only if the\nprocess is reversible. Crucially, from a numerical point of view, the entropy\nproduction rate is an {\\em a posteriori} quantity, hence it can be computed in\nthe course of a simulation as the ergodic average of a certain functional of\nthe process (the so-called Gallavotti-Cohen (GC) action functional). We compute\nthe entropy production for various numerical schemes such as explicit\nEuler-Maruyama and explicit Milstein's for reversible SDEs with additive or\nmultiplicative noise. Additionally, we analyze the entropy production for the\nBBK integrator of the Langevin processes. We show that entropy production is an\nobservable that distinguishes between different numerical schemes in terms of\ntheir discretization-induced irreversibility. Furthermore, our results show\nthat the type of the noise critically affects the behavior of the entropy\nproduction rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 11:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 00:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

HIV infection elicits a vigorous immune response\nstarting about 2-3 weeks post infection that can lower the amount of virus in\nthe body, but which cannot eradicate the virus. How HIV establishes a chronic\ninfection in the face of a strong immune response remains poorly understood. It\nhas been shown that HIV is able to rapidly change its proteins via mutation to\nevade recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Typically,\nan HIV-infected patient will generate 4-12 CTL responses specific for parts of\nviral proteins called epitopes. Such CTL responses lead to strong selective\npressure to change the viral sequences encoding these epitopes so as to avoid\nCTL recognition. Here we review experimental data on HIV evolution in response\nto CTL pressure, mathematical models developed to explain this evolution, and\nhighlight problems associated with the data and previous modeling efforts. We\nshow that estimates of the strength of the epitope-specific CTL response depend\non the method used to fit models to experimental data and on the assumptions\nmade regarding how mutants are generated during infection. We illustrate that\nallowing CTL responses to decay over time may improve the fit to experimental\ndata and provides higher estimates of the killing efficacy of HIV-specific\nCTLs. We also propose a novel method for simultaneously estimating the killing\nefficacy of multiple CTL populations specific for different epitopes of HIV\nusing stochastic simulations. Lastly, we show that current estimates of the\nefficacy at which HIV-specific CTLs clear virus-infected cells can be improved\nby more frequent sampling of viral sequences and by combining data on sequence\nevolution with experimentally measured CTL dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 13:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Different nuclear\nreactions (fusion of stable and radioactive nuclei, multi-nucleon transfers and\nneutron capture), which could be used for the production of new isotopes of\nsuperheavy (SH) elements, are discussed in the paper. The gap of unknown SH\nnuclei, located between the isotopes which were produced earlier in the cold\nand hot fusion reactions, can be filled in fusion reactions of $^{48}$Ca with\navailable lighter isotopes of Pu, Am, and Cm. Cross sections for the production\nof these nuclei are predicted to be rather large, and the corresponding\nexperiments can be easily performed at existing facilities. For the first time,\na narrow pathway is found to the middle of the island of stability owing to\npossible $\\beta^+$-decay of SH isotopes which can be formed in ordinary fusion\nreactions of stable nuclei. Multi-nucleon transfer processes at near barrier\ncollisions of heavy (and very heavy, U-like) ions are shown to be quite\nrealistic reaction mechanism allowing us to produce new neutron enriched heavy\nnuclei located in the unexplored upper part of the nuclear map. Neutron capture\nreactions can be also used for the production of the long-living neutron rich\nSH nuclei. Strong neutron fluxes might be provided by pulsed nuclear reactors\nand by nuclear explosions in laboratory conditions and by supernova explosions\nin nature.

Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, a key step for\nthe development of a reliable hydrogen-based technology requires solving the\nissue of storage and transport of hydrogen.

Once inside the symplast, zinc is transported to the\npericycle, where it exits by means of HMA (Heavy Metal ATPase) transporters.\nThe combination of symplastic transport and spatial separation of influx and\nefflux produces a pattern in which zinc accumulates in the pericycle. Here,\nmathematical modelling was employed to study the importance of ZIP regulation,\nHMA abundance and symplastic transport in creation of the radial pattern of\nzinc in primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana.\n  A comprehensive one-dimensional dynamic model of radial zinc transport in\nroots was developed and used to conduct simulations. The model accounts for the\nstructure of the root consisting of symplast and apoplast and includes effects\nof water flow, diffusion, and cross-membrane transport via transporters. It\nalso incorporates the radial geometry and varying porosity of root tissues, as\nwell as regulation of ZIP transporters.\n  Steady state patterns were calculated for various zinc concentrations in the\nmedium, water influx and HMA abundance. The experimentally observed zinc\ngradient was reproduced very well. Increase of HMA or decrease in water influx\nled to loss of the gradient. The dynamic behaviour for a change in medium\nconcentration and water influx was also simulated showing short adaptation\ntimes in the range of seconds to minutes. Slowing down regulation led to\noscillations in expression levels, suggesting the need for rapid regulation and\nexistence of buffering agents.\n  The model captures the experimental findings very well and confirms the\nhypothesis that low abundance of HMA4 produces a radial gradient in zinc\nconcentration. Surprisingly, transpiration was found to be also a key\nparameter. The model suggests that ZIP regulation takes place on a comparable\ntime scale as symplastic transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 14:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Oct 2012 14:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-25"}

The obtained gamma-ray emissivities\nabove 250 MeV are (5.9 +/- 0.1(stat) (+0.9/-1.0)(sys)), (10.2 +/- 0.4(stat)\n(+1.2/-1.7)(sys)), and (9.1 +/- 0.3(stat) (+1.5/-0.6)(sys)) x10^(-27) photons\ns^(-1) sr^(-1) H-atom^(-1) for the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and Cepheus and Polaris\nflare regions, respectively. Whereas the energy dependences of the emissivities\nagree well with that predicted from direct CR observations at the Earth, the\nmeasured emissivities from 250 MeV to 10 GeV indicate a variation of the CR\ndensity by ~20% in the neighborhood of the solar system, even if we consider\nsystematic uncertainties. The molecular mass calibrating ratio, Xco =\nN(H2)/Wco, is found to be (0.96 +/- 0.06(stat) (+0.15/-0.12)(sys)), (0.99 +/-\n0.08(stat) (+0.18/-0.10)(sys)), and (0.63 +/- 0.02(stat) (+0.09/-0.07)(sys))\nx10^20 H2-molecule cm^(-2) (K km s^(-1))^(-1) for the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and\nCepheus and Polaris flare regions, respectively, suggesting a variation of Xco\nin the vicinity of the solar system. From the obtained values of Xco, the\nmasses of molecular gas traced by Wco in the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and Cepheus and\nPolaris flare regions are estimated to be ~5x10^3, ~10^3, and ~3.3x10^4 Msolar,\nrespectively. A comparable amount of gas not traced well by standard HI and CO\nsurveys is found in the regions investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 11:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}
