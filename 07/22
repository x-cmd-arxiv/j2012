Each neuron in the\npopulations, however, does not spike independently: spike events are correlated\nfrom cell to cell. To what degree does this apparent redundancy impact the\naccuracy with which decisions can be made, and the computations that are\nrequired to optimally decide? We explore these questions for two illustrative\nmodels of correlation among cells. Each model is statistically identical at the\nlevel of pairs cells, but differs in higher-order statistics that describe the\nsimultaneous activity of larger cell groups. We find that the presence of\ncorrelations can diminish the performance attained by an ideal decision maker\nto either a small or large extent, depending on the nature of the higher-order\ninteractions. Moreover, while this optimal performance can in some cases be\nobtained via the standard integration-to-bound operation, in others it requires\na nonlinear computation on incoming spikes. Overall, we conclude that a given\nlevel of pairwise correlations--even when restricted to identical neural\npopulations--may not always indicate redundancies that diminish decision making\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 16:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

This thesis is organized into three chapters. In\nChapter 1 the introduction of the boundary in the non-abelian CS model is\nillustrated. The purpose of this chapter is to describe some techniques known\nin literature, which are largely used in the following chapters. In Chapter 2\nthe three-dimensional non-abelian BF theory with a boundary is analyzed. The\nmost interesting result of this chapter is the interpretation of the boundary\nterm of the Ward Identities as the gauge-fixing for the residual gauge\ninvariance of the theory on the boundary. In Chapter 3 the techniques developed\nin the previous chapters are applied to the abelian BF theory in four\nspace-time dimensions with a boundary. The most interesting result of this\nchapter, (and of the entire thesis), is the characterization of the boundary\ndynamics in terms of canonical commutation relations generated by the algebra\nof local boundary observables, which exists due to the residual gauge\ninvariance of the bulk theory. The results obtained suggest that this model can\nbe considered as an effective theory for the (3+1)D Topological Insulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 16:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-24"}

Specifically, we show that B' masses of 700 GeV or more can be\nprobed. Moreover, if a B' is found, then the chirality of its coupling can be\ndetermined. Finally, we present signal cross sections for several different LHC\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 21:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The primary contents of the catalogue are source positions, magnitudes\nand fluxes in 1 to 6 passbands, and these are accompanied by profile\ndiagnostics and variability statistics. The XMM-SUSS is populated by 753,578 UV\nsource detections above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold limit which relate\nto 624,049 unique objects. Taking account of substantial overlaps between\nobservations, the net sky area covered is 29-54 square degrees, depending on UV\nfilter. The magnitude distributions peak at 20.2, 20.9 and 21.2 in UVW2, UVM2\nand UVW1 respectively.

The distributions of\nsource colours in the UV and optical filters are shown together with the\nexpected loci of stars and galaxies, and indicate that sources which are\ndetected in multiple UV bands are predominantly star-forming galaxies and stars\nof type G or earlier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2012 21:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The standard analysis shows that\nthis estimate x' satisfies ||x'-x||_infty^2 < ||x_tail||_2^2 / k, where x_tail\nis the vector containing all but the largest k coordinates of x. Our main\nresult is that most of the coordinates of x' have substantially less error than\nthis upper bound; namely, for any c < O(log n), we show that each coordinate i\nsatisfies (x'_i - x_i)^2 < (c/log n) ||x_tail||_2^2/k with probability\n1-2^{-Omega(c)}, as long as the hash functions are fully independent. This\nsubsumes the previous bound and is optimal for all c. Using these improved\npoint estimates, we prove a stronger concentration result for set estimates by\nfirst analyzing the covariance matrix and then using a\nmedian-of-median-of-medians argument to bootstrap the failure probability\nbounds. These results also give improved results for l_2 recovery of exactly\nk-sparse estimates x^* when x is drawn from a distribution with suitable decay,\nsuch as a power law or lognormal. We complement our results with simulations of\nCount-Sketch on a power law distribution. The empirical evidence indicates that\nour theoretical bounds give a precise characterization of the algorithm's\nperformance: the asymptotics are correct and the associated constants are\nsmall. Our proof shows that any symmetric random variable with finite variance\nand positive Fourier transform concentrates around 0 at least as well as a\nGaussian. This result, which may be of independent interest, gives good\nconcentration even when the noise does not converge to a Gaussian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2012 06:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 19:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 22:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

Our\nmacroscopic measurement technique extends the use of ETp meas-urements down to\nlow temperatures and the concomitant lower current densities, because the\nlarger area still yields measurable currents. Thus, we reported previously a\nsurprising lack of temperature-dependence for ETp via the blue copper protein\nazurin (Az), from 80K till denaturation, while ETp via apo-(Cu-free) Az was\nfound to be temperature de-pendent \\geq 200K.

Multi-armed bandit problems formalize this dilemma in its canonical\nform. Most current research in this field focuses on generic solutions that can\nbe applied to a wide range of problems. However, in practice, it is often the\ncase that a form of prior information is available about the specific class of\ntarget problems. Prior knowledge is rarely used in current solutions due to the\nlack of a systematic approach to incorporate it into the E/E strategy.\n  To address a specific class of E/E problems, we propose to proceed in three\nsteps: (i) model prior knowledge in the form of a probability distribution over\nthe target class of E/E problems; (ii) choose a large hypothesis space of\ncandidate E/E strategies; and (iii), solve an optimization problem to find a\ncandidate E/E strategy of maximal average performance over a sample of problems\ndrawn from the prior distribution.\n  We illustrate this meta-learning approach with two different hypothesis\nspaces: one where E/E strategies are numerically parameterized and another\nwhere E/E strategies are represented as small symbolic formulas.

The latter becomes relevant for high\nenough magnetic fields and results in spontaneous annihilation of gamma-rays.\nThe absorbed energy is then redistributed into electron-positron pairs and soft\nradiation. We show that as quenching sets an upper value for the source\nrest-frame gamma-ray luminosity, one has, by neccessity, to resort to Doppler\nfactors that lie above a certain value in order to explain the TeV\nobservations. The existence of this lower limit for the Doppler factor has also\nimplications on the energetics of the emitting region. In this aspect, the\nproposed method can be regarded as an extension of the widely used one for\nestimating the equipartition magnetic field using radio observations. In our\ncase, the leptonic synchrotron component is replaced by the proton synchrotron\nemission and the radio by the VHE gamma-ray observations. We show specifically\nthat one can model the TeV observations by using parameter values that minimize\nboth the energy density and the jet power at the cost of high-values of the\nDoppler factor. On the other hand, the modelling can also be done by using the\nminimum possible Doppler factor; this, however, leads to a particle dominated\nregion and high jet power for a wide range of magnetic field values. Despite\nthe fact that we have focused on the case of 3C 279, our analysis can be of\nrelevance to all TeV blazars favoring hadronic modelling that have, moreover,\nsimultaneous X-ray observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2012 13:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Recently there has been increasing\ninterests in the influence of decay and absorption, and their engineering\napplications. Here it is shown that even a small decay can significantly\ninfluence the dynamical behaviour of a system, above and beyond a mere change\nof the overall norm. In particular, a small decay can lead to a breakdown of\nadiabatic transfer schemes, even when both the spectrum and the eigenfunctions\nare only sightly modified. This is demonstrated for the generalization of a\nSTIRAP scheme that has recently been implemented in optical waveguide\nstructures. Here the question how an additional absorption in either the\ninitial or the target waveguide influences the transfer property of the scheme\nis addressed. It is found that the scheme breaks down for small values of the\nabsorption at a relatively sharp threshold, which can be estimated by simple\nanalytical arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2012 15:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2013 11:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Since some of these algorithms involve\nentangled states, it is commonly concluded that entanglement is insufficient to\nenable quantum speedup. As I explain, however, the operations belonging to this\nset are precisely those which will never yield a violation of the Bell\ninequalities. Thus it should be no surprise that entangled quantum states which\nonly undergo operations in this set are efficiently simulable classically. What\nthe Gottesman-Knill theorem shows us is that it is possible to use an entangled\nstate to less than its full potential. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful\nsense in which entanglement is sufficient for quantum speedup: an entangled\nquantum state provides sufficient physical resources to enable quantum speedup,\nwhether or not one elects to use these resources fully.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2012 15:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 13:28:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 16:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-06"}

The fermionic and bosonic quantum fields are treated as\ninterdependent fields satisfying coupled quantum field equations, all expressed\nat the same space-time coordinate. Quantization is realized by expanding the\nquantum fields in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. This\napproach is applied in a QCD description of the light quarks with a zero Higgs\nfield. Originally massless and pointlike, an isolated quark (described in its\nown center-of-mass) acquires mass and a finite extent when treated as an\ninteracting system of quark and gluon fields. The binding mechanism of this\nlocalized system has a topological character, being a consequence of the\nnon-linear nature of QCD, while being insensitive to the magnitude of the\ncoupling constant to lowest order. To prevent this system from collapsing\ngeneral relativity is introduced. The quark stabilizes at a radius of 8.8\nPlanck lengths and acquires a mass of 3.2 MeV, in remarkable agreement with\naccepted phenomenological values. It is suggested that the two higher\ngenerations of quarks are associated with the other two real solutions of the\nHiggs field equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2012 07:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}
