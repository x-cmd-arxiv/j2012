Unlike classical counter abstraction\n(used in the analysis of parameterized systems with unordered or unstructured\ntopologies) the new representation is tailored for proving properties of\nlinearly ordered parameterized systems, i.e., systems with arbitrary many\nfinite processes placed in an array. The relative positions in the array\ncapture the relative priorities of the processes. Configurations of such\nsystems are finite words of arbitrary lengths. The processes communicate using\nglobal transitions constrained by their relative priorities. Intuitively, an\nelement of the symbolic representation has a base and a set of counters. It\ndenotes configurations that respect the constraints imposed by the counters and\nthat have the base as a sub word. We use the new representation in a uniform\nand automatic Counter Example Guided Refinement scheme. We introduce a\nrelaxation operator that allows a well quasi ordering argument for the\ntermination of each iteration of the refinement loop. We explain how to refine\nthe relaxation to systematically prune out false positives.

Another important example is online\ncollaborative filtering in which a widely used comparison class is the set of\nmatrices with a small trace norm. In this paper we isolate a property of\nmatrices, which we call (beta,tau)-decomposability, and derive an efficient\nonline learning algorithm, that enjoys a regret bound of O*(sqrt(beta tau T))\nfor all problems in which the comparison class is composed of\n(beta,tau)-decomposable matrices.

The main goal is to generate a\ndegraded wiretap channel in application layer over which Wyner-type secrecy\nencoding is invoked to deliver additional secure information. More\nspecifically, we study secrecy enhancement of DES block cipher working in\ncipher feedback model (CFB) when adjustable and intentional noise is introduced\ninto encrypted data in application layer. A verification strategy in exhaustive\nsearch step of linear attack is designed to allow Eve to mount a successful\nattack in the noisy environment. Thus, a controllable wiretap channel is\ncreated over multiple frames by taking advantage of errors in Eve's\ncryptanalysis, whose secrecy capacity is found for the case of known channel\nstates at receivers. As a result, additional secure information can be\ndelivered by performing Wyner type secrecy encoding over super-frames ahead of\nencryption, namely, our proposed secrecy encoding-then-encryption scheme.

We\nuse the simulation results to calibrate analytical expressions for test\nparticle velocity-space diffusion coefficients and provide simple fits that can\nbe used in other work.\n  The test particle velocity diffusion in our simulations is due to a\ncombination of two processes: interactions between particles and magnetic\ncompressions in the turbulence (as in linear transit-time damping; TTD) and\nwhat we refer to as Fermi Type-B (FTB) interactions, in which charged particles\nmoving on field lines may be thought of as beads spiralling around moving\nwires.

The\nproposed FSG employs a new hierarchical distance learning strategy to minimize\nthe error difference. For this purpose, we first construct an ensemble of\nbase-layer fuzzy k- Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers, each of which receives\na different feature set extracted from the same sample set. The fuzzy\nmembership values computed at the decision space of each fuzzy k-NN classifier\nare concatenated to form the feature vectors of a fusion space. Finally, the\nfeature vectors are fed to a meta-layer classifier to learn the degree of\naccuracy of the decisions of the base-layer classifiers for meta-layer\nclassification. Rather than the power of the individual base layer-classifiers,\ndiversity and cooperation of the classifiers become an important issue to\nimprove the overall performance of the proposed FSG.

Recent studies showed\nstrong localization of the electric and magnetic energies of microwave fields\nby MDM ferrite disks. For electromagnetic waves irradiating MDM disks, these\nsmall ferrite samples appear as singular subwavelength regions with time and\nspace symmetry breakings. The fields scattered by a MDM disk are characterized\nby topologically distinctive power-flow vortices and helicity structures.

Robotics is yet another promising and fast-growing industry that deals\nwith the creation of machines that operate in an autonomous fashion and serve\nfor various applications including space exploration, weaponry, laboratory\nresearch, and manufacturing. It is in space exploration that the most common\ntype of robots is the planetary rover which moves across the surface of a\nplanet and conducts a thorough geological study of the celestial surface. This\ntype of rover system is still ad-hoc in that it incorporates its software into\nits core hardware making the whole system cohesive, tightly-coupled, more\nsusceptible to shortcomings, less flexible, hard to be scaled and maintained,\nand impossible to be adapted to other purposes. This paper proposes a\nservice-oriented architecture for space exploration robotic rover systems made\nout of loosely-coupled and distributed web services. The proposed architecture\nconsists of three elementary tiers: the client tier that corresponds to the\nactual rover; the server tier that corresponds to the web services; and the\nmiddleware tier that corresponds to an Enterprise Service Bus which promotes\ninteroperability between the interconnected entities. The niche of this\narchitecture is that rover's software components are decoupled and isolated\nfrom the rover's body and possibly deployed at a distant location. A\nservice-oriented architecture promotes integrate-ability, scalability,\nreusability, maintainability, and interoperability for client-to-server\ncommunication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2012 09:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

Currently, the Internet encompasses more than five billion online\nsites and this number is exponentially increasing every day. Fundamentally,\nInformation Retrieval (IR) is the science and practice of storing documents and\nretrieving information from within these documents. Mathematically, IR systems\nare at the core based on a feature vector model coupled with a term weighting\nscheme that weights terms in a document according to their significance with\nrespect to the context in which they appear. Practically, Vector Space Model\n(VSM), Term Frequency (TF), and Inverse Term Frequency (IDF) are among other\nlong-established techniques employed in mainstream IR systems. However, present\nIR models only target generic-type text documents, in that, they do not\nconsider specific formats of files such as HTML web documents. This paper\nproposes a new semantic-sensitive web information retrieval model for HTML\ndocuments. It consists of a vector model called SWVM and a weighting scheme\ncalled BTF-IDF, particularly designed to support the indexing and retrieval of\nHTML web documents. The chief advantage of the proposed model is that it\nassigns extra weights for terms that appear in certain pre-specified HTML tags\nthat are correlated to the semantics of the document. Additionally, the model\nis semantic-sensitive as it generates synonyms for every term being indexed and\nlater weights them appropriately to increase the likelihood of retrieving\ndocuments with similar context but different vocabulary terms. Experiments\nconducted, revealed a momentous enhancement in the precision of web IR systems\nand a radical increase in the number of relevant documents being retrieved. As\nfurther research, the proposed model is to be upgraded so as to support the\nindexing and retrieval of web images in multimedia-rich web documents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2012 09:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

The user scheduling is adaptive to\nthe ESI, the QSI and the channel state information (CSI) over a shorter\ntimescale.

We study in detail the transition from regular to chaotic motion,\nin two different cases: the time independent model and the time evolving model.\nIn the time dependent model, we follow the evolution of orbits as the galaxy\ndevelops a dense and massive nucleus in its core, as mass is transported\nexponentially from the disk to the galactic center. In addition, we construct\nsome numerical diagrams in which we present the correlations between the main\nparameters of our galactic model. Our numerical calculations indicate, that\nstars with values of angular momentum Lz less than or equal to a critical value\nLzc, moving near to the galactic plane, are scattered to the halo upon\nencountering the nuclear region and subsequently display chaotic motion. A\nlinear relationship exists between the critical value of the angular momentum\nLzc and the mass of the nucleus Mn. Furthermore, the extent of the chaotic\nregion increases as the value of the mass of the nucleus increases. Moreover,\nour simulations indicate that the degree of chaos increases linearly, as the\nmass of the nucleus increases. These results strongly indicate that the ordered\nor chaotic nature of orbits, depends on the presence of massive objects in the\ngalactic cores of the galaxies. Our results suggest, that for disk galaxies\nwith massive and prominent nuclei, the low angular momentum stars in the\nassociated central regions of the galaxy, must be in predominantly chaotic\norbits. Some theoretical arguments to support the numerically derived outcomes\nare presented. Comparison with similar previous works is also made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2012 12:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Computer programming is a difficult,\ncomplicated, unfamiliar, non-automated, and a challenging discipline for\neveryone; especially, for students, new programmers and end-users. This paper\nproposes a new programming language and an environment for writing computer\napplications based on source-code generation. It is mainly a template-driven\nautomatic natural imperative programming language called MyProLang. It\nharnesses GUI templates to generate proprietary natural language source-code,\ninstead of having computer programmers write the code manually. MyProLang is a\nblend of five elements. A proprietary natural programming language with\nunsophisticated grammatical rules and expressive syntax; automation templates\nthat automate the generation of instructions and thereby minimizing the\nlearning and training time; an NLG engine to generate natural instructions; a\nsource-to-source compiler that analyzes, parses, and build executables; and an\nergonomic IDE that houses diverse functions whose role is to simplify the\nsoftware development process. MyProLang is expected to make programming open to\neveryone including students, programmers and end-users. In that sense, anyone\ncan start programming systematically, in an automated manner and in natural\nlanguage; without wasting time in learning how to formulate instructions and\narrange expressions, without putting up with unfamiliar structures and symbols,\nand without being annoyed by syntax errors. In the long run, this increases the\nproductivity, quality and time-to-market in software development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2012 15:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}
