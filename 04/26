Wavelets allow us to reformulate the RM synthesis method in a\nscale-dependent way and to visualize the data as a function of Faraday depth\nand scale. We present observational tests to recognize magnetic field\nstructures. A region with a regular magnetic field generates a broad \"disk\" in\nFaraday space (\"Faraday spectrum\"), with two \"horns\" when the distribution of\ncosmic-ray electrons is broader than that of the thermal electrons. Each\nmagnetic field reversal generates one asymmetric \"horn\" on top of the \"disk\". A\nregion with a turbulent field can be recognized as a \"Faraday forest\" of many\ncomponents. These tests are applied to the spectral ranges of various synthesis\nradio telescopes. We argue that the ratio of maximum to minimum wavelengths\ndetermines the range of scales that can be identified in Faraday space. A\nreliable recognition of magnetic field structures requires the analysis of data\ncubes in position-position-Faraday depth space (\"PPF cubes\"), observed over a\nwide and continuous wavelength range, allowing the recognition of a wide range\nof scales as well as high resolution in Faraday space.

We emphasize the nonlinear interaction of rarefaction\nwaves excited at the interface between a cylindrical jet and the surrounding\nmedium. From simplified one-dimensional models with radial jet structure, we\nfind that a decrease in the relativistic pressure due to the interacting\nrarefaction waves in the central zone of the jet transiently yields a more\npowerful boost of the bulk jet than that expected from single rarefaction\nacceleration. This leads to a cyclic in-situ energy conversion between thermal\nand bulk kinetic energies which induces radial oscillating motion of the jet.\nThe oscillation timescale is characterized by the initial pressure ratio of the\njet to the ambient medium, and follows a simple scaling relation $\\tau_{\\rm\noscillation} \\propto (P_{\\rm jet,0}/P_{\\rm amb,0})^{1/2}$. It is confirmed from\nextended two-dimensional simulations that this radial oscillating motion in the\none-dimensional system manifests as modulation of the structure of the jet in a\nmore realistic situation where a relativistically hot jet propagates through an\nambient medium.

However, the only numerical\nevidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field\nevolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by\nLaplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the\ntransition in 3D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the\ntransition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone\nboundary, using the Pencil Code to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are\nreadily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass\naccretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active\nzones, at the $\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2}$ level. The vortex sits in a pressure\nmaximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A\npressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized\nvortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic\ninstabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This suggests that either\nthe parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the RWI supplies\nvorticity faster than they can destroy it. We conclude that the resistive\ntransition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via RWI. Our\nresults lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha-disk\napproximation, and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverage\non modeling this transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 17:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2012 13:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Feynman divined that a quantum simulator - a\nspecial-purpose \"analog\" processor built using quantum particles (qubits) -\nwould be inherently adept at such problems.

About\nthree weeks into the outbursts, again drops in intensity are seen.

The fact that spell checkers are based on regular\ndictionaries, they suffer from data sparseness problem as they cannot capture\nlarge vocabulary of words including proper names, domain-specific terms,\ntechnical jargons, special acronyms, and terminologies. As a result, they\nexhibit low error detection rate and often fail to catch major errors in the\ntext. This paper proposes a new context-sensitive spelling correction method\nfor detecting and correcting non-word and real-word errors in digital text\ndocuments. The approach hinges around data statistics from Google Web 1T 5-gram\ndata set which consists of a big volume of n-gram word sequences, extracted\nfrom the World Wide Web. Fundamentally, the proposed method comprises an error\ndetector that detects misspellings, a candidate spellings generator based on a\ncharacter 2-gram model that generates correction suggestions, and an error\ncorrector that performs contextual error correction. Experiments conducted on a\nset of text documents from different domains and containing misspellings,\nshowed an outstanding spelling error correction rate and a drastic reduction of\nboth non-word and real-word errors. In a further study, the proposed algorithm\nis to be parallelized so as to lower the computational cost of the error\ndetection and correction processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2012 07:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-27"}

A characteristic feature of the models under consideration\nis criticality or super-criticality of sources (with respect to Sobolev's\nembeddings) along with super-criticality of damping mechanisms which, in\naddition, may be also geometrically constrained.\n  Our aim is to present several methods relying on cancelations, harmonic\nanalysis and geometric analysis, which enable to handle criticality and also\nsuper-criticality in both sources and the damping of the underlined nonlinear\nPDE. It turns out that if carefully analyzed the nonlinearity can be taken\n\"advantage of\" in order to produce implementable damping mechanism.\n  Another goal of these lectures is the understanding of control mechanisms\nwhich are geometrically constrained. The final task boils down to showing that\nappropriately damped system is \"quasi-stable\" in the sense that any two\ntrajectories approach each other exponentially fast up to a compact term which\ncan grow in time. Showing this property- formulated as quasi-stability estimate\n-is the key and technically demanding issue that requires suitable tools. These\ninclude: weighted energy inequalities, compensated compactness, Carleman's\nestimates and some elements of microlocal analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2012 08:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-27"}

Massive molecular\noutflows have recently been revealed in some AGN hosts. However, the physical\nproperties and structure of these AGN-driven molecular outflows are still\npoorly constrained. Here we present new IRAM PdBI observations of Mrk231, the\nclosest quasar known, targeting both the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) transitions. We\ndetect broad wings in both transitions, tracing a massive molecular outflow\nwith velocities up to 800 km/s. The wings are spatially resolved at high\nsignificance level (5-11 sigma), indicating that the molecular outflow extends\non the kpc scale. The CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of the red broad wings is\nconsistent with the ratio observed in the narrow core, while the blue broad\nwing is less excited than the core. The latter result suggests that quasar\ndriven outflow models invoking shocks (which would predict higher gas\nexcitation) are not appropriate to describe the bulk of the outflow in Mrk231.\nHowever, we note that within the central 700 pc the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of\nthe red wing is slightly, but significantly, higher than in the line core,\nsuggesting that shocks may play a role in the central region. We also find that\nthe average size of the outflow anticorrelates with the critical density of the\ntransition used as a wind tracer. This indicates that, although diffuse and\ndense clumps coexist in the outflowing gas, dense outflowing clouds have\nshorter lifetime and that they evaporate into the diffuse component along the\noutflow or, more simply, that diffuse clouds are more efficiently accelerated\nto larger distances by radiation pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2012 10:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2012 17:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The transition is through a\nmassless Dirac-Weyl semimetal, point Fermi surface phase which is unique in\nthat (1) it appears in a three dimensional crystal, (2) the band critical point\noccurs at $k$=0, and (3) linear bands are degenerate with conventional\n(massive) bands at the critical point (before inclusion of spin-orbit\ncoupling). Further interest arises because the critical point separates a\nconventional (trivial) phase from a topological phase. In the native cubic\nstructure this is a zero-gap topological semimetal; we show how spin-orbit\ncoupling and uniaxial strain converts the system to a topological insulator\n(TI). We also analyze the origin of the linear band in this class of materials,\nwhich is the characteristic that makes them potentially useful in\nthermoelectric applications or possibly as transparent conductors. We\ncharacterize the formal charge as Co$^{+}$ $d^8$, consistent with the gap, with\nits $\\bar{3}$ site symmetry, and with its lack of moment. The Sb states are\ncharacterized as $p_x$ (separately, $p_y$) $\\sigma$-bonded $Sb_4$ ring states\noccupied and the corresponding antibonding states empty. The remaining\n(locally) $p_z$ orbitals form molecular orbitals with definite parity centered\non the empty $2a$ site in the skutterudite structure. Eight such orbitals must\nbe occupied; the one giving the linear band is an odd orbital singlet $A_{2u}$\nat the zone center. We observe that the provocative linearity of the band\nwithin the gap is a consequence of the aforementioned near-degeneracy, which is\nalso responsible for the small band gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2012 12:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-29"}

Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat the two-bulge method is not a separate approximation, but ensues directly\nfrom the Fourier expansion of a linear tidal theory equipped with an arbitrary\nrheological model involving a departure from elasticity. To this end, we use\nthe most general mathematical formalism applicable to linear bodily tides.

One of the reasons for this is that the translation process is\ncharacterized by indefinite number of states, thanks to existence of polysomes.\nWe bypass this difficulty by applying a trick consisting in lumping multiple\nstates of translated mRNA into few dynamical variables and by introducing a\nvariable describing the pool of translating ribosomes. The simplest model can\nbe solved analytically under some assumptions. The basic and simple model can\nbe extended, if necessary, to take into account various phenomena such as the\ninteraction between translating ribosomes, limited amount of ribosomal units or\nregulation of translation by microRNA. The model can be used as a building\nblock (translation module) for more complex models of cellular processes. We\ndemonstrate the utility of the model in two examples.

The algebra\nis used to derive a new quantum geometrical uncertainty in direction, with\nvariance given by $\\langle \\Delta \\theta^2\\rangle = \\ell_P/L$ at separation\n$L$, that dominates over standard quantum position uncertainty for bodies\ngreater than the Planck mass.

It is well known that this approach\nshows that radiocarbon dates of over 3,000 years are in error, which is\ngenerally attributed to past variation in atmospheric levels of 14C.

RIP matrices are known to enable efficient and stable reconstruction of\nsufficiently sparse signals, but the deterministic construction of such\nmatrices has proven very difficult.

The\nfirst phase of ChanPlaNS targeted 21 mostly high-excitation PNe within ~1.5 kpc\nof Earth, yielding 4 detections of diffuse X-ray emission and 9 detections of\nX-ray-luminous point sources at the central stars (CSPNe) of these objects.\nCombining these results with those obtained from Chandra archival data for all\n(14) other PNe within ~1.5 kpc that have been observed to date, we find an\noverall X-ray detection rate of ~70%. Roughly 50% of the PNe observed by\nChandra harbor X-ray-luminous CSPNe, while soft, diffuse X-ray emission tracing\nshocks formed by energetic wind collisions is detected in ~30%; five objects\ndisplay both diffuse and point-like emission components. The presence of X-ray\nsources appears correlated with PN density structure, in that molecule-poor,\nelliptical nebulae are more likely to display X-ray emission (either point-like\nor diffuse) than molecule-rich, bipolar or Ring-like nebulae. All but one of\nthe X-ray point sources detected at CSPNe display X-ray spectra that are harder\nthan expected from hot (~100 kK) central star photospheres, possibly indicating\na high frequency of binary companions to CSPNe. Other potential explanations\ninclude self-shocking winds or PN mass fallback. Most PNe detected as diffuse\nX-ray sources are elliptical nebulae that display a nested shell/halo structure\nand bright ansae; the diffuse X-ray emission regions are confined within inner,\nsharp-rimmed shells. All sample PNe that display diffuse X-ray emission have\ninner shell dynamical ages <~5x10^3 yr, placing firm constraints on the\ntimescale for strong shocks due to wind interactions in PNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 16:24:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2012 00:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Recent experiments indicate that the essential process in\nthe navigation takes place in bird's eye and uses chemical reaction involving\nmolecular ions with unpaired electron spins (radical pair).

Here\nwe utilize the results of two behavioral experiments conducted on European\nRobins to argue that the average life-time of the radical pair is of the order\nof a microsecond and therefore agrees with experimental estimations of this\nparameter for cryptochrome --- a pigment believed to form the radical pairs.
