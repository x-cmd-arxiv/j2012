We measure the dependence of tc on stress amplitude, frequency, and on the\nage-dependent initial loss modulus. At first sight our observations appear\nquantitatively consistent with a simple soft-glassy rheology (SGR)-type model,\nin which barrier crossings by mesoscopic elements are purely strain-induced.\nFor a given strain amplitude {\\gamma}0 each element can be classified as fluid\nor solid according to whether its local yield strain exceeds {\\gamma}0. Each\ncycle, the barrier heights E of yielded elements are reassigned according to a\nfixed prior distribution {\\rho}(E): this fixes the per-cycle probability\nR({\\gamma}0) of a fluid elements becoming solid. As the fraction of solid\nelements builds up, {\\gamma}0 falls (at constant stress amplitude), so\nR({\\gamma}0) increases. This positive feedback accounts for the sudden\nsolidification after a long delay. The model thus appears to directly link\nmacroscopic rheology with mesoscopic barrier height statistics: within its\nprecepts, our data point towards a power law for {\\rho}(E) rather than the\nexponential form usually assumed in SGR. However, despite this apparent\nsuccess, closer investigation shows that the assumptions of the model cannot be\nreconciled with the extremely large strain amplitudes arising in our\nexperiments. The quantitative explanation of delayed solidification in Laponite\ntherefore remains an open theoretical challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 16:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

The\nphase diagram of the dynamical process depends on the temperature T, the\ncoupling constant J and on the value of the branching ratio <k(k-1)>/<k> where\nk is the degree of the nodes in the network. For fixed value of the coupling\nthe critical temperature increases linearly with the branching ration which\ndiverges with the increasing cutoff value \\xi or value of the \\gamma exponent\n\\gamma< 3. This result suggests that the fractal disorder of the\nsuperconducting material can be responsible for an enhancement of the\nsuperconducting critical temperature. At low temperature and low couplings T<<1\nand J<<1, instead, we observe a different behavior for annealed and quenched\nnetworks. In the annealed networks there is no phase transition at zero\ntemperature while on quenched network we observe a Griffith phase dominated by\nextremely rare events and a phase transition at zero temperature. The Griffiths\ncritical region, nevertheless, is decreasing in size with increasing value of\nthe cutoff \\xi of the degree distribution for values of the \\gamma exponents\n\\gamma< 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 17:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This can be studied in the\nmyriad model, in which cosmic rays diffuse from point-like instantaneous\nsources located randomly throughout the Galaxy. To test this hypothesis, one\nmust compute the flux due to a catalog of local sources, but also the error\nbars associated to this quantity. This turns out not to be as straightforward\nas it seems, as the standard deviation is infinite when computed for the most\ngeneral statistical ensemble. The goals of this paper are to provide a method\nto associate error bars to the flux measurements which has a clear statistical\nmeaning, and to explore the relation between the myriad model and the more\nusual source model based on a continuous distribution. To this end, we show\nthat the quantiles of the flux distribution are well-defined, even though the\nstandard deviation is infinite. They can be used to compute 68% confidence\nlevels, for instance.

The most extreme case is an average 45% \\pm 5% difference\nin cluster mass between the Planck Collaboration (2011b) and Mantz et al.\n(2010b), for clusters at z > 0.13 (averaged over 16 clusters). These mass\ndifferences induce differences in cluster observables defined within an R500\naperture. After accounting for aperture differences, we find very good\nagreement in gas mass estimates between the different groups.

Therefore, in the event of detection of a non-zero primordial\nbispectrum, additional constraints on the parameter controlling the\nmomentum-dependence in the squeezed limit becomes an important question. We\nexplore the effects of these non-Gaussian initial conditions on large-scale\nstructure and the cosmic microwave background, with particular attention to the\ngalaxy power spectrum at large scales and scale-dependence corrections to\ngalaxy bias.

Since spatial organization can significantly affect\nevolutionary dynamics, the need is growing for evolutionary experiments in\nspatially structured environments. The surface of a Petri dish provides such an\nenvironment, but a more detailed understanding of microbial growth on Petri\ndishes is necessary to interpret such experiments.

We also\nderive the shape of these patterns analytically without relying on microscopic\ndetails of the model. In particular, we find that the relative fitness of two\nmicrobial strains can be estimated from the logarithmic spirals created by\nselective sweeps. The theory is tested with strains of the budding yeast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, for spatial competitions with different initial\nconditions and for a range of relative fitnesses. The reaction-diffusion model\nalso connects the microscopic parameters like growth rates and diffusion\nconstants with macroscopic spatial patterns and predicts the relationship\nbetween fitness in liquid cultures and on Petri dishes, which we confirmed\nexperimentally.

The technique exploits the propagation of query bindings and extends\nthe Magic Set (MS) optimization technique.\n  An important feature of disjunctive Datalog is nonmonotonicity, which calls\nfor nondeterministic implementations, such as backtracking search. A\ndistinguishing characteristic of the new method is that the optimization can be\nexploited also during the nondeterministic phase. In particular, after some\nassumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program may\nbecome irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for dynamic\npruning of the search space. In contrast, the effect of the previously defined\nMS methods for disjunctive Datalog is limited to the deterministic portion of\nthe process. In this way, the potential performance gain by using the proposed\nmethod can be exponential, as could be observed empirically.\n  The correctness of MS is established thanks to a strong relationship between\nMS and unfounded sets that has not been studied in the literature before. This\nknowledge allows for extending the method also to programs with stratified\nnegation in a natural way.\n  The proposed method has been implemented in DLV and various experiments have\nbeen conducted. Experimental results on synthetic data confirm the utility of\nMS for disjunctive Datalog, and they highlight the computational gain that may\nbe obtained by the new method w.r.t. the previously proposed MS methods for\ndisjunctive Datalog programs. Further experiments on real-world data show the\nbenefits of MS within an application scenario that has received considerable\nattention in recent years, the problem of answering user queries over possibly\ninconsistent databases originating from integration of autonomous sources of\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 23:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}

In this work, we\ndevelop a package on GPU, called gDRR, for the accurate and efficient\ncomputations of x-ray projection images in CBCT under clinically realistic\nconditions. The primary signal is computed by a tri-linear ray-tracing\nalgorithm. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is then performed, yielding the\nprimary signal and the scatter signal, both with noise. A denoising process is\napplied to obtain a smooth scatter signal. The noise component is then obtained\nby combining the difference between the MC primary and the ray-tracing primary\nsignals, and the difference between the MC simulated scatter and the denoised\nscatter signals. Finally, a calibration step converts the calculated noise\nsignal into a realistic one by scaling its amplitude. For a typical CBCT\nprojection with a poly-energetic spectrum, the calculation time for the primary\nsignal is 1.2~2.3 sec, while the MC simulations take 28.1~95.3 sec.

As a consequence, the\ncoarse-grained vorticity field can be predicted through standard statistical\nmechanics arguments (relying on the Hamiltonian structure of the\ntwo-dimensional Euler flow), for any given set of the integral constraints.\n  It has been suggested that the theory applies equally well to geophysical\nturbulence; specifically in the case of the quasi-geostrophic equations, with\npotential vorticity playing the role of the advected quantity.

To do this, we provide a very\nsimple model for the motion of a roulette wheel and ball and demonstrate that\nknowledge of initial position, velocity and acceleration is sufficient to\npredict the outcome with adequate certainty to achieve a positive expected\nreturn. We describe two physically realisable systems to obtain this knowledge\nboth incognito and {\\em in situ}.

With a more sophisticated, albeit more intrusive,\nsystem (mounting a digital camera above the wheel) we demonstrate a range of\nsystematic and statistically significant biases which can be exploited to\nprovide an improved guess of the outcome.

The energy\nresolution of the HMS and SOS calorimeters is better than $\\sigma/E \\sim\n6%/\\sqrt E $, and pion/electron ($\\pi/e$) separation of about 100:1 has been\nachieved in energy range 1 -- 5 GeV. Good agreement has been observed between\nthe experimental and simulated energy resolutions, but simulations\nsystematically exceed experimentally determined $\\pi^-$ suppression factors by\nclose to a factor of two. For the SHMS spectrometer presently under\nconstruction details on the design and accompanying GEANT4 simulation efforts\nare given. The anticipated performance of the new calorimeter is predicted over\nthe full momentum range of the SHMS. Good electron/hadron separation is\nanticipated by combining the energy deposited in an initial (preshower)\ncalorimeter layer with the total energy deposited in the calorimeter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2012 15:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The experiments\nare carried out at an unprecedented 0.5 kHz repetition rate, allowing \"real\ntime\" optimization of accelerator parameters. Well-collimated and stable\nelectron beams with a quasi-monoenergetic peak in excess of 100 keV are\nmeasured. Particle-in-cell simulations show excellent agreement with the\nexperimental results and suggest an acceleration mechanism based on electron\ntrapping on the density downramp, due to the time varying phase velocity of the\nplasma waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2012 15:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
