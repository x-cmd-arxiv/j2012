We focus mainly on the interpretation of the unique\nenergy, curvature and symmetry properties which enable such S^3 cells to\ndescribe full chiral restoration in Skyrme models and which markedly\ndistinguish them from the flat and periodic unit cells of Skyrmion crystals.\nThese key features clarify, in particular, why an S^3 cell interpretation as a\ncrystal-cell model in which the specific cell geometry is without physical\nsignificance, as tentatively adopted by Adhikari et al., is insufficient. The\nensuing criticism does therefore not apply to the usual interpretation of S^3\ncells which we describe. We also suggest a few directions in which the latter\ninterpretation may be developed further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 18:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-13"}

Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential\nfor posting \"deceptive opinion spam\" -- fictitious reviews that have been\ndeliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. But while this\npractice has received considerable public attention and concern, relatively\nlittle is known about the actual prevalence, or rate, of deception in online\nreview communities, and less still about the factors that influence it.\n  We propose a generative model of deception which, in conjunction with a\ndeception classifier, we use to explore the prevalence of deception in six\npopular online review communities: Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline,\nTripAdvisor, and Yelp. We additionally propose a theoretical model of online\nreviews based on economic signaling theory, in which consumer reviews diminish\nthe inherent information asymmetry between consumers and producers, by acting\nas a signal to a product's true, unknown quality. We find that deceptive\nopinion spam is a growing problem overall, but with different growth rates\nacross communities. These rates, we argue, are driven by the different\nsignaling costs associated with deception for each review community, e.g.,\nposting requirements. When measures are taken to increase signaling cost, e.g.,\nfiltering reviews written by first-time reviewers, deception prevalence is\neffectively reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 18:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

Therefore, cache, register file\nand superscalar parameters are the major architectural concerns in designing a\nsuperscalar architecture for embedded processors.

During the last few years, cluster\nexpansion methods have provided a microscopic, quantum theory to study the\nspectral diffusion of a central spin. These methods have proven to be very\naccurate and efficient for problems of nuclear-induced electron spin\ndecoherence in which hyperfine interactions with the central electron spin are\nmuch stronger than dipolar interactions among the nuclei. We provide an\nin-depth study of central spin decoherence for a canonical scale-invariant\nall-dipolar spin system. We show how cluster methods may be adapted to treat\nthis problem in which central and bath spin interactions are of comparable\nstrength. Our extensive numerical work shows that a properly modified cluster\ntheory is convergent for this problem even as simple perturbative arguments\nbegin to break down. By treating clusters in the presence of energy detunings\ndue to the long-range (diagonal) dipolar interactions of the surrounding\nenvironment and carefully averaging the effects over different spin states, we\nfind that the nontrivial flip-flop dynamics among the spins becomes effectively\nlocalized by disorder in the energy splittings of the spins. This localization\neffect allows for a robust calculation of the spin echo signal in a dipolarly\ncoupled bath of spins of the same kind, while considering clusters of no more\nthan 6 spins.

Larger M_h values make the 'parent'\ncloud mass (turbulent Jeans mass) larger, but promote fragmentation to smaller\nscales; this steepens the slope of the low-mass CMF and shifts the turnover\nmass.

We then introduce pruning operators extract subgraphs of\nincreasing steepness. For an increasing steepness, the number of never\nascending paths becomes smaller and smaller. This reduces the watershed zone,\nwhere catchment basins overlap. A last pruning operator called scissor\nassociates to each node outside the regional minima one and only one edge.

The design of controllers uses the theory of\ndynamical systems to construct a mathematical control law that ensures that the\ncontrolled system has certain properties, such as asymptotic convergence to an\nequilibrium point, while optimizing some performance criteria. However, owing\nto quantization errors arising from the use of fixed-point arithmetic, the\nimplementation of this control law can only guarantee practical stability:\nunder the actions of the implementation, the trajectories of the controlled\nsystem converge to a bounded set around the equilibrium point, and the size of\nthe bounded set is proportional to the error in the implementation.

We clarify the relationship between the evolution equations of orbital\nangular momenta corresponding to the two different decompositions above. We\nalso try to answer the question whether the two different decompositions of the\nnucleon momentum really lead to different evolution equations, thereby\npredicting conflicting asymptotic values for the quark and gluon momentum\nfractions in the nucleon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 00:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 01:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In the\ntraditional MG model, agents are assumed to have access to global information\nabout the past history of the underlying system, and they react by choosing one\nof the two available options associated with a single resource. Complex systems\narising in a modern society, however, can possess many resources so that the\nnumber of available strategies/resources can be multiple. We propose a class of\nmodels to investigate MG dynamics with multiple strategies. In particular, in\nsuch a system, at any time an agent can either choose a minority strategy (say\nwith probability p) based on available local information or simply choose a\nstrategy randomly (with probability 1 - p). The parameter p thus defines the\nminority-preference probability, which is key to the dynamics of the underlying\nsystem. A striking finding is the emergence of strategy-grouping states where a\nparticular number of agents choose a particular subset of strategies. We\ndevelop an analytic theory based on the mean-field framework to understand the\n\"bifurcation\" to the grouping states and their evolution. The grouping\nphenomenon has also been revealed in a real-world example of the subsystem of\n27 stocks in the Shanghai Stock Market's Steel Plate.

This approach\nhas not hitherto been considered for models that also possess nontrivial linear\nconstraints, Lin. This paper carries this out for some concrete relational\nparticle models (RPM's).

From a detailed analysis of the photometry, each object is found\nto have a 1216 A continuum luminosity in excess of L ~1e23 W/Hz, a critical\nvalue above which 21-cm has never been detected at any redshift. At these\nwavelengths, and below, hydrogen is excited above the ground state so that it\ncannot absorb in 21-cm. In order to apply the equation of photoionsation\nequilibrium, we demonstrate that this critical value also applies to the\nionising (< 912 A) radiation. We use this to show, for a variety of gas density\ndistributions, that upon placing a quasar within a galaxy of gas there is\nalways an ultra-violet luminosity above which all of the gas in the galaxy is\nionised. While in this state the hydrogen cannot be detected nor cannot engage\nin star formation. Applying the mean ionising photon rate of all of the sources\nsearched, we find, using canonical values for the gas density and recombination\nrate coefficient, that the observed critical luminosity gives a scale-length (3\nkpc) similar that of the neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Milky Way, a large spiral\ngalaxy. Thus, this simple, yet physically motivated, model can explain the\ncritical luminosity, above which neutral gas is not detected. This indicates\nthat these galaxies are probably devoid of star-forming material, rather the\nnon-detection of 21-cm being due to the sensitivity limits of current radio\ntelescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 05:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 06:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 00:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2012 02:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The relatively\nlarge radial scale-length of the dust disk points to radial mixing of the dusty\nISM within the stellar disk. The large vertical dust scale and the clumpy dust\ndistribution of our SED model are both consistent with a scenario in which the\nvertical structure of the ISM is dictated by the balance of turbulence and\nself-gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 10:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Using a sample of\ngalaxies out to z~1 extracted from the COSMOS survey, we identify the fraction\nof massive disks that display a dust lane. Our goal is to explore the evolution\nin the stability of the molecular ISM disks in spiral galaxies over a cosmic\ntimescale. We check the reliability of our morphological classifications\nagainst changes in restframe wavelength, resolution, and cosmic dimming with\n(artificially redshifted) images of local galaxies from SDSS. We find that the\nfraction of L* disks with dust lanes in COSMOS is consistent with the local\nfraction (~80%) out to z~0.7. At z=0.8, the dust lane fraction is only slightly\nlower. A somewhat lower dust lane fraction in starbursting galaxies tentatively\nsupports the notion that a high specific star formation rate can efficiently\ndestroy or inhibit a dense molecular disk. A small subsample of higher redshift\nCOSMOS galaxies display low internal reddening (E[B-V]), as well as a low\nincidence of dust lanes. These may be disks in which the growth of the dusty\nISM disk lags behind that of the stellar disk. We note that at z=0.8, the most\nmassive galaxies display a lower dust lane fraction than lower mass galaxies. A\nsmall contribution of recent mergers or starbursts to this most massive\npopulation may be responsible. The fact that the fraction of galaxies with dust\nlanes in COSMOS is consistent with little or no evolution implies that models\nto explain the Spectral Energy Distribution or the host galaxy dust extinction\nof supernovae based on local galaxies are still applicable to higher redshift\nspirals. It also suggests that dust lanes are long lived phenomena or can be\nreformed over very short time-scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 10:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The\ntype II spicules have been linked with on-disk observations of Rapid\nBlue-shifted Excursions (RBEs) in the Ha and Ca 8542 lines. Here we analyze\nobservations optimized for the detection of RBEs in both Ha and Ca 8542\nsimultaneously at a high temporal cadence taken with CRISP at the SST. This\nstudy used a high-quality time sequence for RBEs at different blue-shifts and\nemployed an automated detection routine to detect a large number of RBEs in\norder to expand on the statistics of RBEs. We find that the number of detected\nRBEs is dependent on the Doppler velocity of the images on which the search is\nperformed. Detection of RBEs at lower velocities increases the estimated number\nof RBEs to the same order of magnitude expected from limb spicules. This shows\nthat RBEs and type II spicules are exponents of the same phenomenon. We provide\nevidence that Ca 8542 RBEs are connected to Ha RBEs and are located closer to\nthe network regions with the Ha RBEs being the continuation, and show that RBEs\nhave an average lifetime of 83.9 s when observed in both spectral lines with\nDoppler velocity ranges of 10-25 km/s in Ca 8542 and 30-50 km/s in Ha.

One is induced by\nthe presence of near-critical eigenvalues in the connectivity matrix W,\nproducing large but slow activity fluctuations along the corresponding\neigenvectors (dynamical slowing). The other relies on W being nonnormal, which\nallows the network activity to make large but fast excursions along specific\ndirections. Here we investigate the tradeoff between nonnormal amplification\nand dynamical slowing in the spontaneous activity of large random neuronal\nnetworks composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We use a Schur\ndecomposition of W to separate the two amplification mechanisms. Assuming\nlinear stochastic dynamics, we derive an exact expression for the expected\namount of purely nonnormal amplification. We find that amplification is very\nlimited if dynamical slowing must be kept weak. We conclude that, to achieve\nstrong transient amplification with little slowing, the connectivity must be\nstructured. We show that unidirectional connections between neurons of the same\ntype together with reciprocal connections between neurons of different types,\nallow for amplification already in the fast dynamical regime. Finally, our\nresults also shed light on the differences between balanced networks in which\ninhibition exactly cancels excitation, and those where inhibition dominates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 10:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-31"}

The robot has no a priori knowledge of the\ntopology of the graph or of its size. Cohen et al. \\cite{Ilcinkas08} introduced\nlabel guided graph exploration which allows the system designer to add short\nlabels to the graph nodes in a preprocessing stage; these labels can guide the\nrobot in the exploration of the graph. In this paper, we address the problem of\nadjustable 1-bit label guided graph exploration. We focus on the labeling\nschemes that not only enable a robot to explore the graph but also allow the\nsystem designer to adjust the ratio of the number of different labels. This\nflexibility is necessary when maintaining different labels may have different\ncosts or when the ratio is pre-specified. We present 1-bit labeling (two\ncolors, namely black and white) schemes for this problem along with a labeling\nalgorithm for generating the required labels. Given an $n$-node graph and a\nrational number $\\rho$, we can design a 1-bit labeling scheme such that\n$n/b\\geq \\rho$ where $b$ is the number of nodes labeled black.

This paper presents predictions for the carbon monoxide (CO) line\nfeatures from models of nuclear starburst disks around AGN. These small scale\n($\\la 100$ pc), dense and hot starbursts have CO luminosities similar to\nscaled-down ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and quasar host galaxies. Nuclear\nstarburst disks that exhibit a pc-scale starburst and could potentially act as\nthe obscuring torus show more efficient CO excitation and higher brightness\ntemperature ratios than those without such a compact starburst. In addition,\nthe compact starburst models predict strong absorption when $J_{\\mathrm{Upper}}\n\\ga 10$, a unique observational signature of these objects. These findings\nallow for the possibility that CO SLEDs could be used to determine if starburst\ndisks are responsible for the obscuration in $z \\la 1$ AGN. Directly isolating\nthe nuclear CO line emission of such compact regions around AGN from\ngalactic-scale emission will require high resolution imaging or selecting AGN\nhost galaxies with weak galactic-scale star formation.

In order to calculate the conductance within the Green's function\nmethod we map the electronic structure from the extended states of the FLAPW\ncalculation to Wannier functions which constitute a minimal localized basis\nset. Our approach benefits from the high accuracy of the underlying FLAPW\ncalculations allowing us to address the complex interplay of structure,\nmagnetism, and spin-orbit coupling and is ideally suited to study\nspin-dependent electronic transport in one-dimensional magnetic nanostructures.\nTo illustrate our approach we study ballistic electron transport in\nnon-magnetic Pt monowires with a single stretched bond including spin-orbit\ncoupling, and in ferromagnetic Co monowires with different collinear magnetic\nalignment of the electrodes with the purpose of analysing the magnetoresistance\nwhen going from tunneling to the contact regime. We further investigate\nspin-orbit scattering due to an impurity atom. We consider two configurations:\na Co atom in a Pt monowire and vice versa. In both cases, the spin-orbit\ninduced band mixing leads to a change of the conductance upon switching the\nmagnetization direction from along the chain axis to perpendicular to it. The\nmain contribution stems from ballistic spin-scattering for the magnetic Co\nimpurity in the non-magnetic Pt monowire and for the Pt scatterer in the\nmagnetic Co monowire from the band formed from states with $d_{xy}$ and\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital symmetry.

To verify the binarity hypothesis on\na larger sample, we started a high-resolution spectral monitoring of about 40\nfield giants, whose binarity was suspected based on either a light curve, an\ninfrared excess, or a peculiar chemical composition. Here we report on the\ndiscovery of the periodic RV variations in BD+46 442, a high-latitude F giant\nwith a disk. We interpret the variations due to the motion around a faint\ncompanion, and deduce the following orbital parameters: Porb = 140.77 d, e =\n0.083, asini=0.31 AU. We find it to be a moderately metal-poor star\n([M/H]=-0.7) without a strong depletion pattern in the photospheric abundances.\nInterestingly, many lines show periodic changes with the orbital phase: Halpha\nswitches between a double-peak emission and a PCyg-like profiles, while strong\nmetal lines appear split during the maximum redshift. Similar effects are\nlikely visible in the spectra of other post-AGB binaries, but their regularity\nis not always realized due to sporadic observations. We propose that these\nfeatures result from an ongoing mass transfer from the evolved giant to the\ncompanion. In particular, the blue-shifted absorption in Halpha, which occurs\nonly at superior conjunction, may result from a jet originating in the\naccretion disk around the companion and seen in absorption towards the luminous\nprimary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 14:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Since secondary users (SU) usually have no prior knowledge on\nthe environment, they need to learn the availability of each channel through\nsensing techniques, which however can be prone to detection errors. We argue\nthat cooperation among secondary users can enable efficient learning and\ncoordination mechanisms in order to maximize the spectrum exploitation by SUs,\nwhile minimizing the impact on the primary network. To this goal, we provide\nthree novel contributions in this paper. First, we formulate the spectrum\nselection in secondary networks as an instance of the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)\nproblem, and we extend the analysis to the collaboration learning case, in\nwhich each SU learns the spectrum occupation, and shares this information with\nother SUs. We show that collaboration among SUs can mitigate the impact of\nsensing errors on system performance, and improve the convergence of the\nlearning process to the optimal solution. Second, we integrate the learning\nalgorithms with two collaboration techniques based on modified versions of the\nHungarian algorithm and of the Round Robin algorithm that allows reducing the\ninterference among SUs. Third, we derive fundamental limits to the performance\nof cooperative learning algorithms based on Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)\npolicies in a symmetric scenario where all SU have the same perception of the\nquality of the resources. Extensive simulation results confirm the\neffectiveness of our joint learning-collaboration algorithm in protecting the\noperations of Primary Users (PUs), while maximizing the performance of SUs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 14:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-16"}

Finally, we\nshow that it is possible to achieve higher scan speeds without causing an\nincrease in the tapping forces using adaptive Q control (AQC), in which the Q\nfactor of the probe is changed instantaneously depending on the magnitude of\nthe error signal in oscillation amplitude. The scan performance of AQC is\nquantitatively compared to that of standard Q control using iso-error curves\nobtained from numerical simulations first and then the results are validated\nthrough scan experiments performed using a physical set-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 14:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A general ADC is modeled as\na causal, discrete-time dynamical system with outputs taking values in a finite\nset. We define the performance of an ADC as the worst-case average intensity of\nthe filtered input matching error, defined as the difference between the input\nand output of the ADC. The passband of the shaping filter used to filter the\nerror signal determines the frequency region of interest for minimizing the\nerror. The problem of finding a lower bound for the performance of an ADC is\nformulated as a dynamic game problem in which the input signal to the ADC plays\nagainst the output of the ADC. Furthermore, the performance measure must be\noptimized in the presence of quantized disturbances (output of the ADC) that\ncan exceed the control variable (input of the ADC) in magnitude. We\ncharacterize the optimal solution in terms of a Bellman-type inequality. A\nnumerical approach is presented to compute the value function in parallel with\nthe feedback law for generating the worst case input signal. The specific\nstructure of the problem is used to prove certain properties of the value\nfunction that simplifies the iterative computation of a certified solution to\nthe Bellman inequality. The solution provides a certified lower bound on the\nperformance of any ADC with respect to the selected performance criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 15:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 18:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-22"}

Inhomogeneous stress develops as gel swells under mechanical\nconstraints, which gives rise to spontaneous buckling instability without\nexternal force. Full control over the post-buckling pattern is experimentally\ndemonstrated. A simple analytical model is developed using elastic energy to\npredict stability and post-buckling patterns upon swelling. Analysis reveals\nthat height to diameter ratio is the most critical design parameter to\ndetermine buckling pattern, which agrees well with experimental and numerical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 22:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We find mean stellar population gradients (negative\n{\\Delta}[Z/H]/log r gradient of -0.285{\\pm}0.064; small positive {\\Delta}log\n(age)/log r gradient of 0.069{\\pm}0.049; and null {\\Delta}[E/Fe]/log r gradient\nof -0.008{\\pm}0.032) that are consistent with those of normal massive\nelliptical galaxies. However, we find a trend between metallicity gradients and\nvelocity dispersion (with a negative slope of -1.616{\\pm}0.539) that is not\nfound for the most massive ellipticals. Furthermore, we find trends between the\nmetallicity gradients and K-band luminosities (with a slope of 0.173{\\pm}0.081)\nas well as the distance from the BCG to the X-ray peak of the host cluster\n(with a slope of -7.546{\\pm}2.752).
