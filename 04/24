We introduced two simple\nlow-Mach-number modifications for the classical Roe flux to decrease the\ndifference between the acoustic and advection contributions of the numerical\ndissipation. While the first modification increases the local numerical\ndissipation, the second decreases it. The numerical tests on the double-Mach\nreflection problem show that both modifications eliminate the kinked Mach stem\nsuffered by the original flux. These results suggest that, other than\ninsufficient numerical dissipation near the shock front, the carbuncle\nphenomena is strongly relevant to the non-comparable acoustic and advection\ncontributions of the numerical dissipation produced by Godunov schemes due to\nthe low Mach number effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 16:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

We study electron\nenergization by numerically integrating the equations of motion of a large\nnumber of test-particle electrons in the time-dependent two-dimensional\nelectric and magnetic fields generated from hybrid simulations (kinetic ions\nand fluid electron) using parameters typical of the solar flare plasma\nenvironment. The shock is produced by injecting plasma flow toward a rigid\npiston. Large-scale magnetic fluctuations -- known to exist in plasmas and\nknown to have important effects on the nonthermal electron acceleration at\nshocks -- are also included in our simulations. For the parameters\ncharacteristic of the flaring region, our calculations suggest that the\ntermination shock formed in the reconnection outflow region (above post-flare\nloops) could accelerate electrons to a kinetic energy of a few MeV within 100\nion cyclotron periods, which is of the order of a millisecond. Given a\nsufficient turbulence amplitude level ($\\delta B^2/B_0^2 \\sim 0.3$), about 10%\nof thermal test-particle electrons are accelerated to more than 15 keV. We find\nthat protons are also accelerated, but not to as high energy in the available\ntime and the energy spectra are considerably steeper than that of the electrons\nfor the parameters used in our simulations.

Numerous\nevolutionary studies have demonstrated the validity of MC but also have shown\nthat MC is substantially overdispersed, i.e. lineage-specific deviations of the\nevolutionary rate of the given gene from the clock greatly exceed the\nexpectation from the sampling error. A fundamental observation of comparative\ngenomics that appears to complement the MC is that the distribution of\nevolution rates across orthologous genes in pairs of related genomes remains\nvirtually unchanged throughout the evolution of life, from bacteria to mammals.\nThe conservation of this distribution implies that the relative evolution rates\nof all genes remain nearly constant, or in other words, that evolutionary rates\nof different genes are strongly correlated within each evolving genome. We\nhypothesized that this correlation is not a simple consequence of MC but could\nbe better explained by a model we dubbed Universal PaceMaker (UPM) of genome\nevolution. The UPM model posits that the rate of evolution changes\nsynchronously across genome-wide sets of genes in all evolving lineages. We\nsought to differentiate between the MC and UPM models by fitting thousands of\nphylogenetic trees for bacterial and archaeal genes to supertrees that reflect\nthe dominant trend of vertical descent in the evolution of archaea and bacteria\nand that were constrained according to the two models. The goodness of fit for\nthe UPM model was better than the fit for the MC model, with overwhelming\nstatistical significance. These results reveal a universal pacemaker of genome\nevolution that could have been in operation throughout the history of life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 16:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This two-impurity Anderson model\nincorporates the competition between the Kondo effect and indirect exchange but\nis amenable to an exact numerical solution via the density-matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG). The particle-hole symmetric model at half-filling\nand zero temperature is used to benchmark R-DMFT results for the magnetic\ncoupling between the two adatoms and for the magnetic properties induced in the\nsubstrate. In particular, the dependence of the local adatom and the nonlocal\nadatom-adatom static susceptibilities as well as the magnetic response of the\nsubstrate on the distance between the adatoms and on the strength of their\ncoupling with the substrate is studied. We find both, excellent agreement with\nthe DMRG data even on subtle details of the competition between RKKY exchange\nand the Kondo effect but also complete failure of the R-DMFT, depending on the\nparameter regime considered. R-DMFT calculations are performed using the\nLanczos method as impurity solver. With the real-space extension of the\ntwo-site DMFT, we also benchmark a simplified R-DMFT variant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 16:58:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 09:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Verification-based algorithms are particularly\ninteresting due to their low complexity (linear in the signal dimension $n$).\nThe analysis predicts the average fraction of unverified signal elements at\neach iteration $\\ell$ where the average is taken over the ensembles of input\nsignals and sensing matrices. The analysis is asymptotic ($n \\rightarrow\n\\infty$) and is similar in nature to the well-known density evolution technique\ncommonly used to analyze iterative decoding algorithms. Compared to the\nexisting technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based on\nnumerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the\nproposed method is much simpler and more accurate. This allows us to design\nirregular sensing graphs for such recovery algorithms. The designed irregular\ngraphs outperform the corresponding regular graphs substantially. For example,\nfor the same recovery complexity per iteration, we design irregular graphs that\ncan recover up to about 40% more non-zero signal elements compared to the\nregular graphs. Simulation results are also provided which demonstrate that the\nproposed asymptotic analysis matches the performance of recovery algorithms for\nlarge but finite values of $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 18:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

This dependence limits the overall ability of upcoming large\nweak-lensing surveys to constrain cosmological parameters.\n  We seek to provide a concise overview of the impact of pixel noise on\nweak-lensing measurements, covering the entire path from noisy images to shear\nestimates. We show that there are at least three distinct layers, where pixel\nnoise not only obscures but biases the outcome of the measurements: 1) the\npropagation of pixel noise to the non-linear observable ellipticity; 2) the\nresponse of the shape-measurement methods to limited amount of information\nextractable from noisy images; and 3) the reaction of shear estimation\nstatistics to the presence of noise and outliers in the measured ellipticities.\n  We identify and discuss several fundamental problems and show that each of\nthem is able to introduce biases in the range of a few tenths to a few percent\nfor galaxies with typical significance levels. Furthermore, all of these biases\ndo not only depend on the brightness of galaxies but also on their ellipticity,\nwith more elliptical galaxies often being harder to measure correctly. We also\ndiscuss existing possibilities to mitigate and novel ideas to avoid the biases\ninduced by pixel noise.

While\n~58% of X-ray Seyferts require a starburst event to fit observed photometry\nonly 26% of the X-ray QSO population appear to have some kind of star formation\ncontribution.

We have extended the\nprevious studies on the DoS by analysing for the first time the orientations of\nstreams of stars and gas, and the distributions of globular clusters within the\nhalo of the MW. It is shown that the spatial distribution of MW globular\nclusters classified as young halo clusters (YH GC) is very similar to the DoS,\nwhile 7 of the 14 analysed streams align with the DoS. The probability to find\nthe observed clustering of streams is only 0.3 per cent when assuming isotropy.\nThe MW thus is surrounded by a vast polar structure (VPOS) of subsystems\n(satellite galaxies, globular clusters and streams), spreading from\nGalactocentric distances as small as 10 kpc out to 250 kpc. These findings\ndemonstrate that a near-isotropic infall of cosmological sub-structure\ncomponents onto the MW is essentially ruled out because a large number of\ninfalling objects would have had to be highly correlated, to a degree not\nnatural for dark matter sub-structures. The majority of satellites, streams and\nYH GCs had to be formed as a correlated population. This is possible in tidal\ntails consisting of material expelled from interacting galaxies. We discuss the\ntidal scenario for the formation of the VPOS, including successes and possible\nchallenges. The potential consequences of the MW satellites being tidal dwarf\ngalaxies are severe. If all the satellite galaxies and YH GCs have been formed\nin an encounter between the young MW and another gas-rich galaxy about 10-11\nGyr ago, then the MW does not have any luminous dark-matter substructures and\nthe missing satellites problem becomes a catastrophic failure of the standard\ncosmological model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Our numerical calculations, indicate that a\nlarge fraction of orbits in the 2D system are chaotic in the time independent\ncase. A careful analysis suggest that several Lindblad resonances are also\nresponsible for the chaotic motion of stars in both hosts galaxies.

This algorithm is straightforward and\ngeneral: it computes the error for each game enumerated, and outputs the game\nthat minimizes this error. By the genericity of our approach, our algorithm can\nbe used to find a weighted voting game that optimizes any exponential time\ncomputable function. We implement our algorithm for the case of the normalized\nBanzhaf index, and we perform experiments in order to study performance and\nerror convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 21:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2012 14:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2013 11:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-02"}

It is common to introduce tomographic concepts\nstarting with the Schrodinger-Dirac picture of quantum mechanics on Hilbert\nspaces.

On the other hand, the Heisenberg picture,which has evolved\nin the $C^\\star-$algebraic approach to quantum mechanics, starts with the\nalgebra of observables and introduce states as a derived concept. The\nequivalence between these two pictures amounts essentially, to the\nGelfand-Naimark-Segal construction.

The representation one defines may be reducible or irreducible,\nbut in either case it allows to identify an unitary group associated with the\n$C^\\star-$algebra by means of its invertible elements.

Because of the quasi-exponential\nredshifting, which occurs during an inflationary period, the physical\nwavelengths of comoving scales that correspond to the present large-scale\nstructure of the Universe were smaller than the Planck length in the early\nstages of the inflationary period. This trans-Planckian effect was studied\nbefore using toy models. The Horava-Lifshitz (HL) theory offers the chance to\nstudy this problem in a candidate UV complete theory of gravity. In this paper\nwe study the evolution of cosmological perturbations according to HL gravity\nassuming that matter gives rise to an inflationary background. As is usually\ndone in inflationary cosmology, we assume that the fluctuations originate in\ntheir minimum energy state. In the trans-Planckian region the fluctuations obey\na non-linear dispersion relation of Corley-Jacobson type. In the \"healthy\nextension\" of HL gravity there is an extra degree of freedom which plays an\nimportant role in the UV region but decouples in the IR, and which influences\nthe cosmological perturbations. We find that in spite of these important\nchanges compared to the usual description, the overall scale-invariance of the\npower spectrum of cosmological perturbations is recovered. However, we obtain\noscillations in the spectrum as a function of wavenumber with a relative\namplitude of order unity and with an effective frequency which scales\nnonlinearly with wavenumber. Taking the usual inflationary parameters we find\nthat the frequency of the oscillations is so large as to render the effect\ndifficult to observe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 00:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2012 13:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

Using the cross-correlation analysis, we found\nanti-correlated hard and soft time lags of the order of a few tens to a few\nhundred seconds and the corresponding intensity states were mostly the\nhorizontal branch (HB) and upper normal branch (NB). The model independent and\ndependent spectral analysis showed that during these time lags the structure of\naccretion disk significantly varied. Both eastern and western approaches were\nused to unfold the X-ray continuum and systematic changes were observed in soft\nand hard spectral components. These changes along with a systematic shift in\nthe frequency of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) made it substantially\nevident that the geometry of the accretion disk is truncated. Simultaneous\nenergy spectral and power density spectral study shows that the production of\nthe horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs) are closely related to the\nComptonizing region rather than the disk component in the accretion disk.

The Keller-Miksis-Parlitz equation is adopted, but modified to\naccount for the presence of the wall. This base model describes the time\nevolution of the bubble surface, which is assumed to remain spherical, and\naccounts for the effect of acoustic radiation losses owing to liquid\ncompressibility in the momentum conservation. Two situations are considered:\nthe base case of an isolated bubble in an unbounded medium; and a bubble near a\nsolid wall. In the latter case, the wall influence is modeled by including a\nsymmetrically oscillating image bubble. The bubble dynamics is traced using a\nnumerical solution of the model equation. Subsequently, Floquet theory is used\nto accurately detect the bifurcation point where bubble oscillations stop\nfollowing the driving ultrasound frequency and undergo period-changing\nbifurcations. Of particular interest is the detection of the subcritical period\ntripling and quadrupling transition. The parametric bifurcation maps are\nobtained as functions of non-dimensional parameters representing the bubble\nradius, the frequency and pressure amplitude of the driving ultrasound field\nand the distance from the wall. It is shown that the presence of the wall\ngenerally stabilises the bubble dynamics, so that much larger values of the\npressure amplitude are needed to generate nonlinear responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 07:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-14"}

Both are decoded by iterative algorithms, which require a\ndisproportional computational effort for low channel noise. They are also\nunable to correct higher noise levels, still below the Shannon theoretical\nlimit. In this paper, we discuss an enhanced version of a convolutional-like\ndecoding paradigm which adopts very large spaces of possible system states, of\nthe order of $2^{64}$. Under such conditions, the traditional convolution\noperation is rendered useless and needs to be replaced by a carefully designed\nstate transition procedure. The size of the system state space completely\nchanges the correction philosophy, as state collisions are virtually impossible\nand the decoding procedure becomes a correction tree. The proposed decoding\nalgorithm is practically cost-free for low channel noise. As the channel noise\napproaches the Shannon limit, it is still possible to perform correction,\nalthough its cost increases to infinity. In many applications, the implemented\ndecoder can essentially outperform both LDPC and TC. This paper describes the\nproposed correction paradigm and theoretically analyzes the asymptotic\ncorrection performance. The considered encoder and decoder were verified\nexperimentally for the binary symmetric channel. The correction process remains\npractically cost-free for channel error rates below 0.05 and 0.13 for the 1/2\nand 1/4 rate codes, respectively. For the considered resource limit, the output\nbit error rates reach the order of $10^{-3}$ for channel error rates 0.08 and\n0.18. The proposed correction paradigm can be easily extended to other\ncommunication channels; the appropriate generalizations are also discussed in\nthis study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 09:25:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2012 14:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The design of Pb and Cu shielding allowed to reach a background\nreduction of two order of magnitude with respect to laboratory radioactivity.

The\ncalculations of the electronic properties of such molecules is a formidable\ntheoretical challenge as one has to describe the spin ground state of a\ntransition metal as the legand field changes. The problem is dominated by the\ninterplay between strong electron correlation at the transition metal site and\ncharge delocalization over the ligands, and thus it fits into a class of\nproblems where density functional theory may be inadequate. Furthermore, the\ncrossover activity is extremely sensitive to environmental conditions, which\nare difficult to fully characterize. Here we discuss the phase transition of a\nprototypical spin crossover molecule as obtained with diffusion Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We demonstrate that the ground state changes depending on whether\nthe molecule is in the gas or in the solid phase. As our calculation provides a\nsolid benchmark for the theory we then assess the performances of density\nfunctional theory. We find that the low spin state is always over-stabilized,\nnot only by the (semi-)local functionals, but even by the most commonly used\nhybrids (such as B3LYP and PBE0). We then propose that reliable results can be\nobtained by using hybrid functionals containing about 50% of exact-exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 11:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

What distinguishes this work from previous\nwork in this area is that regions where channels meet at a junction can\nperiodically alternate between permitting the propagation of waves and blocking\nthem. These valve-like areas are used to select waves based on the length of\ntime that it takes waves to propagate from one valve to another. In an\nexperimental implementation, the channels which make up the circuit layout are\nprojected by a digital projector connected to a computer.

It has been widely accepted that traditional file\nsignatures are inferior alternatives to inverted files. This paper describes\nTopSig, a new approach to the construction of file signatures. Many advances in\nsemantic hashing and dimensionality reduction have been made in recent times,\nbut these were not so far linked to general purpose, signature file based,\nsearch engines. This paper introduces a different signature file approach that\nbuilds upon and extends these recent advances. We are able to demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in the performance of signature file based indexing\nand retrieval, performance that is comparable to that of state of the art\ninverted file based systems, including Language models and BM25.

In this paper, we propose a pooling method to\naggregate expert opinions. Intuitively, it works as if the experts were\ncontinuously updating their opinions in order to accommodate the expertise of\nothers. Each updated opinion takes the form of a linear opinion pool, where the\nweight that an expert assigns to a peer's opinion is inversely related to the\ndistance between their opinions. In other words, experts are assumed to prefer\nopinions that are close to their own opinions. We prove that such an updating\nprocess leads to consensus, \\textit{i.e.}, the experts all converge towards the\nsame opinion. Further, we show that if rational experts are rewarded using the\nquadratic scoring rule, then the assumption that they prefer opinions that are\nclose to their own opinions follows naturally. We empirically demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed method using real-world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 15:12:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 23:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2013 21:49:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-11"}

Our results are\nconsistent with superconductivity occurring only in the minority phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 10:03:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 10:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2012 09:54:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 13:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Recently, the bipolar Choquet integral has been proposed for\nthe case in which the underlying scale is bipolar. In this paper we propose the\nbipolar Shilkret integral and the bipolar Sugeno integral. Moreover, we provide\nan axiomatic characterization of all these three bipolar fuzzy integrals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 21:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-27"}

Breaking with Cramer's original theory, the\ntransaction is not connected to the simultaneously retarded and advanced\nspacetime propagation of classical fields, as in the spirit of Wheeler-Feynman\nelectrodynamics. Instead, the transaction is seen as an archetypal structure\nintrinsic within the quantum formalism. The present approach is advantageous in\nthat, while preserving the essential point of Cramer's theory, is also fully\nconsistent with the standard quantum formalism. In particular, it has the\nadvantage of avoiding the introduction of elements which are completely\nextraneous to quantum formalism (such as the propagation of real physical waves\nin four-dimensional spacetime, the phase difference between offer and\nconfirmation waves which is necessary for the elimination of \"tails\", the\nechoing mechanism, etc.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 06:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}
