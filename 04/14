By using a\nBose-Einstein condensate analogue model for gravitational dynamics, we address\nhere the cosmological constant issue from an analogue gravity standpoint.\nStarting from the fundamental equations describing a system of condensed\nbosons, we highlight the presence of a vacuum source term for the analogue\ngravitational field, playing the role of a cosmological constant. In this\nsimple system it is possible to compute from scratch the value of this\nconstant, to compare it with other characteristic energy scales and hence\naddress the problem of its magnitude within this framework, suggesting a\ndifferent path for the solution of this longstanding puzzle. We find that, even\nthough this constant term is related with quantum vacuum effects, it is not\nimmediately related to the ground state energy of the condensate. On the\ngravity side this result suggests that the interpretation and computation of\nthe cosmological term as a form of renormalized vacuum energy might be\nmisleading, its origin being related to the mechanism that instead produces\nspacetime from its pregeometric progenitor, shedding a different light on the\nsubject and at the same time suggesting a potentially relevant role of analogue\nmodels in the understanding of quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 16:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 09:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-25"}

At the same time single photons\nand pairs of single photons are important building blocks in the fields of\nlinear optical based quantum computation and quantum repeater infrastructure.\nThese fields possess enormous potential and much scientific and technological\nprogress has been made in developing individual components, like quantum\nmemories and photon sources using various physical implementations. However,\nfurther progress suffers from the lack of compatibility between these different\ncomponents. Ultimately, one aims for a versatile source of single photons and\nphoton pairs in order to overcome this hurdle of incompatibility. Such a photon\nsource should allow for tuning of the spectral properties (wide wavelength\nrange and narrow bandwidth) to address different implementations while\nretaining high efficiency. In addition, it should be able to bridge different\nwavelength regimes to make implementations compatible. Here we introduce and\nexperimentally demonstrate such a versatile single photon and photon pair\nsource based on the physics of whispering gallery resonators. A disk-shaped,\nmonolithic and intrinsically stable resonator is made of lithium niobate and\nsupports a cavity-assisted triply-resonant spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion process. Measurements show that photon pairs are efficiently\ngenerated in two highly tunable resonator modes. We verify wavelength tuning\nover 100 nm between both modes with a controllable bandwidth between 7.2 and 13\nMHz. Heralding of single photons yields anti-bunching with $g^{(2)}(0) < 0.2$.\nThis compact source provides unprecedented possibilities to couple to different\nphysical quantum systems and renders it ideal for the implementation of quantum\nrepeaters and optical quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 17:21:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2012 09:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 02:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-24"}

The optimality of a temporal path\n(journey) in this context can be defined in several terms, including\ntopological (e.g. {\\em shortest} in hops) and temporal (e.g. {\\em fastest,\nforemost}).

The faint radio and X-ray emission could\nconceivably be produced by an X-ray binary, star formation, a supernova remnant\nor a low-luminosity AGN powered by an intermediate mass black hole. In light of\nour new EVLA observations, we find that the most likely scenario is an\naccreting intermediate mass black hole, with other explanations incompatible\nwith the observed X-ray and/or radio luminosities or statistically unlikely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The goal is to disseminate\nall messages efficiently, hopefully achieving an order-optimal spreading rate\nover unicast wireless random networks. First, we show that a random-push\nstrategy -- where a user sends its own or a received packet at random -- is\norder-wise suboptimal in a random geometric graph: specifically,\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ times slower than optimal spreading. It is known that this\ngap can be closed if each user has \"full\" mobility, since this effectively\ncreates a complete graph. We instead consider velocity-constrained mobility\nwhere at each time slot the user moves locally using a discrete random walk\nwith velocity $v(n)$ that is much lower than full mobility. We propose a simple\ntwo-stage dissemination strategy that alternates between individual message\nflooding (\"self promotion\") and random gossiping.

In these\nwomen, malaria parasites are frequently found sequestered in the placental\nintervillous spaces, a condition referred to as placental malaria (PM).\nPlacental malaria threatens the health of the mother and the child's life by\ncausing still births and reduction in gestational age. An estimated 24 million\npregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa are at risk. Mechanisms responsible for\nincreased susceptibility in pregnant women are not fully understood. Pregnancy\nmalaria studies have been limited by the lack of a suitable animal model. This\nresearch aimed to develop a baboon (Papio anubis) model for studying PM. The\npregnancies of three adult female baboons were synchronized and their\ngestational levels confirmed by ultrasonography. On the 150th day of gestation\nthe pregnant baboons were infected with Plasmodium knowlesi H strain parasites\ntogether with four nulligravid control baboons. Parasitaemia was monitored from\ntwo days post inoculation until the 159th day of gestation when caesarean\nsection was done on one baboon in order to obtain the placenta. Two baboons\naborted their conceptus. Smears prepared from placental blood demonstrated the\npresence of Plasmodium knowlesi parasites in all the three sampled placentas.\nThese new findings show that P. knowlesi sequesters in the baboon placenta. In\naddition, this study has characterized haemoglobin, eosinophil, Immunoglobulin\nG and Immunoglobulin M profiles in this model. Thus a non human primate\n(baboon) model for studying PM has been established. The established baboon -\nP. knowlesi model for studying human placental/pregnancy malaria now offers an\nopportunity for circumventing the obstacles experienced during human studies\nlike having inadequate tissue for analysis, inaccurate estimation of\ngestational age, moral, ethical and financial limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 00:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 08:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-18"}

The billiard table\nOmega(KS) with boundary KS is, a priori, not well defined. That is, one cannot\na priori determine the minimal path traversed by a billiard ball subject to a\ncollision in the boundary of the table. It is this problem which makes\nOmega(KS) such an interesting, yet difficult, table to analyze. In this paper,\nwe approach this problem by approximating (from the inside) Omega(KS) by\nwell-defined (prefractal) rational polygonal billiard tables Omega(KS_n). We\nfirst show that the flat surface S(KS_n) determined from the rational billiard\nOmega(KS_n) is a branched cover of the singly punctured hexagonal torus. Such a\nresult, when combined with the results of [Gut2], allows us to define a\nsequence of compatible orbits of prefractal billiards. We define a hybrid orbit\nof a prefractal billiard Omega(KS_n) and show that every dense orbit of a\nprefractal billiard is a dense hybrid orbit of Omega(KS_n). This result is key\nin obtaining a topological dichotomy for a sequence of compatible orbits.\nFurthermore, we determine a sufficient condition for a sequence of compatible\norbits to be a sequence of compatible periodic hybrid orbits. We then examine\nthe limiting behavior of a sequence of compatible periodic hybrid orbits. We\nshow that the trivial limit of particular (eventually) constant sequences of\ncompatible hybrid orbits constitutes an orbit of Omega(KS). In addition, we\nshow that the union of two suitably chosen nontrivial polygonal paths connects\ntwo elusive limit points of the Koch snowflake. Finally, we discuss how it may\nbe possible for our results to be generalized to other fractal billiard tables\nand how understanding the structures of the Veech groups of the prefractal\nbilliards may help in determining `fractal flat surfaces' naturally associated\nwith the billiard flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 02:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

Liouville hypersurfaces are used to define a gluing\noperation for contact manifolds called the Liouville connect sum. Performing\nthis operation on a contact manifold $(M, \\xi)$ gives an exact -- and in many\ncases, Weinstein -- cobordism whose concave boundary is $(M, \\xi)$ and whose\nconvex boundary is the surgered manifold. These cobordisms are used to\nestablish the existence of \"fillability\" and \"non-vanishing contact homology\"\nmonoids in symplectomorphism groups of Liouville domains, study the symplectic\nfillability of a family of contact manifolds which fiber over the circle,\nassociate cobordisms to certain branched coverings of contact manifolds, and\nconstruct exact symplectic cobordisms that do not admit Weinstein structures.\n  The Liouville connect sum generalizes the Weinstein handle attachment and is\nused to extend the definition of contact $(1/k)$-surgery along Legendrian knots\nin contact 3-manifolds to contact $(1/k)$-surgery along Legendrian spheres in\ncontact manifolds of arbitrary dimension.

Existing studies on MCC performance\ntypically rely on either over-simplified Wyner-type models or complex\nsystem-level simulations. The promising theoretical results (typically using\nWyner models) seem to materialize neither in complex simulations nor in\npractice. To more accurately investigate the theoretical performance of MCC,\nthis paper models an entire plane of interfering cells as a Poisson random\ntessellation. The base stations (BSs) are then clustered using a regular\nlattice, whereby BSs in the same cluster mitigate mutual interference by\nbeamforming with perfect channel state information. Techniques from stochastic\ngeometry and large deviation theory are applied to analyze the outage\nprobability as a function of the mobile locations, scattering environment, and\nthe average number of cooperating BSs per cluster, L. For mobiles near the\ncenters of BS clusters, it is shown that as L increases, outage probability\ndiminishes sub-exponentially if scattering is sparse, and following a power law\nwith an exponent proportional to the signal diversity order if scattering is\nrich. For randomly located mobiles, regardless of scattering, outage\nprobability is shown to scale with increasing L following a power law with an\nexponent no larger than 0.5. These results confirm analytically that\ncluster-edge mobiles are the bottleneck for network coverage and provide a\nplausible analytic framework for more realistic analysis of other multi-cell\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 12:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 09:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-07"}

In this work, we report a few general rules\nthat relate the variance with the sample size and the sampling interval. These\nresults are observed and confirmed numerically. These variance rules are\nderived for the MCMC method but are also valid for the correlated samples\nobtained using other Monte Carlo methods. The main contribution of this work\nincludes the theoretical proof of these numerical observations and the set of\nassumptions that lead to them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 14:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2013 15:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 08:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

The solution of the metric\nfunctions is satisfied with $g_{tt} = - g_{rr}^{-1}$. Constrained by the\nobservation of the rotational stars moving in circular orbits with nearly\nconstant tangential speed in a spiral galaxy, the background of the phantom\nfield which is spatially inhomogeneous has an exponential potential. To avoid\nthe well-known quantum instability of the vacuum at high frequencies, the\nphantom field defined in an effective theory is valid only at low energies.\nUnder this assumption, we further investigate the following properties. The\nabsorption cross section of the low-energy $S$-wave excitations of the phantom\nfield into the central black hole is shown to be the horizontal area of the\ncentral black hole. Because the infalling phantom particles have a total\nnegative energy, the accretion of the phantom energy is related to the decrease\nof the black hole mass which is estimated to be much less than a solar mass in\nthe lifetime of the Universe. Using a simple model with the cold dark matter\nvery weakly coupled to the \"{\\it low-frequency}\" phantom particles which are\ngenerated from the background, we show that these two densities can be\nquasi-stable in the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 15:06:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Sep 2012 18:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2012 12:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 00:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

We show that, in many cases, this task can be\naccomplished with a simple two-step strategy: (1) formulate a linear program\nwhose optimum value is a bound for the minimum number we are seeking, and (2)\nspecify a solution to the dual program, whose objective value by weak duality\nimmediately yields a sufficient condition for the design to be non-blocking.\n  We illustrate this technique through a variety of examples, ranging from\ncircuit to multirate to photonic switching, from unicast to $f$-cast and\nmulticast, and from strict- to wide-sense non-blocking. The switching\narchitectures in the examples are of Clos-type and Banyan-type, which are the\ntwo most popular architectural choices for designing non-blocking switching\nnetworks.\n  To prove the result in the multirate Clos network case, we formulate a new\nproblem called {\\sc dynamic weighted edge coloring} which generalizes the {\\sc\ndynamic bin packing} problem.

For graph-valued random variables, for instance, the Frechet sample mean\nmay fail to converge to a unique value. Hence, it becomes necessary to consider\nthe convergence of sequences of sets of graphs. We show that a specific type of\nalmost sure convergence for the Frechet sample mean previously introduced by\nZiezold (1977) is, in fact, equivalent to the Kuratowski outer limit of a\nsequence of Frechet sample means. Equipped with this outer limit, we provide a\nnew proof of the strong consistency of the Frechet sample mean for graph-valued\nrandom variables in separable (pseudo-)metric space.
