The equations of motion are more complicated\nthan the ones in pure higher spin AdS$_3$ gravity, but are still tractable. As\nall the solutions in higher spin gravity are automatically the solutions of\nhigher spin TMG, we focus on other solutions.

We suggest that the GRB prompt emission is\nmainly a result of two upscattering processes. The first process is the\nComptonization of relatively cold soft photons of the star off electrons of a\nhot shell of plasma of temperature T_e of the order of 10^{9} K (or kT_e~100\nkeV) that moves sub-relativistically with the bulk velocity V_b substantially\nless than the speed of light c. In this phase, the Comptonization parameter Y\nis high and the interaction between a blackbody-like soft seed photon\npopulation and hot electrons leads to formation of a saturated Comptonization\nspectrum modified by the sub-relativistic bulk outflow. The second process is\nan upscattering of the previously Comptonized spectrum by the plasma outflow\nonce it becomes relativistic. This process gives rise to the high-energy\npower-law component above the peak in the EF(E)-diagram where F(E) is the\nenergy flux. The latter process can be described by a convolution of the\nComptonized spectrum with a broken-power-law Green function. Possible physical\nscenarios for this second upscattering process are discussed.

In this paper, we\nrevisit the issue by re-simulating a Milky Way class dark matter (DM) halo with\nunprecedented resolution. Our set of cosmological hydrodynamic Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement (AMR) simulations, called the Nut suite, allows us to investigate\nthe effect of supernova feedback and UV photoionisation at high redshift with\nsub-parsec resolution. We subsequently follow the effect of interactions with\nthe Milky Way-like halo using a lower spatial resolution (50pc) version of the\nsimulation down to z=0. This latter produces a population of simulated\nsatellites that we compare to the observed satellites of the Milky Way and M31.\nWe find that supernova feedback reduces star formation in the least massive\nsatellites but enhances it in the more massive ones. Photoionisation appears to\nplay a very minor role in suppressing star and galaxy formation in all\nprogenitors of satellite halos. By far the largest effect on the satellite\npopulation is found to be the mass of the host and whether gas cooling is\nincluded in the simulation or not. Indeed, inclusion of gas cooling\ndramatically reduces the number of satellites captured at high redshift which\nsurvive down to z=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2012 22:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Nov 2012 17:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

To\naddress scientific questions arising from those data, new regression methods\nthat take matrices as covariates are needed, and sparsity or other forms of\nregularization are crucial due to the ultrahigh dimensionality and complex\nstructure of the matrix data. The popular lasso and related regularization\nmethods hinge upon the sparsity of the true signal in terms of the number of\nits nonzero coefficients. However, for the matrix data, the true signal is\noften of, or can be well approximated by, a low rank structure. As such, the\nsparsity is frequently in the form of low rank of the matrix parameters, which\nmay seriously violate the assumption of the classical lasso. In this article,\nwe propose a class of regularized matrix regression methods based on spectral\nregularization. Highly efficient and scalable estimation algorithm is\ndeveloped, and a degrees of freedom formula is derived to facilitate model\nselection along the regularization path.

However, it\nis an open question whether or not the widely accepted peaked solitary waves\ncan be derived from the fully nonlinear wave equations. In this paper, a\nunified wave model (UWM) based on the symmetry and the fully nonlinear wave\nequations is put forward for progressive waves with permanent form in finite\nwater depth. Different from traditional wave models, the flows described by the\nUWM are not necessarily irrotational at crest, so that it is more general. The\nunified wave model admits not only the traditional progressive waves with\nsmooth crest, but also a new kind of solitary waves with peaked crest that\ninclude the famous peaked solitary waves given by the Camassa-Holm equation.\nBesides, it is proved that Kelvin's theorem still holds everywhere for the\nnewly found peaked solitary waves. Thus, the UWM unifies, for the first time,\nboth of the traditional smooth waves and the peaked solitary waves. In other\nwords, the peaked solitary waves are consistent with the traditional smooth\nones. So, in the frame of inviscid fluid, the peaked solitary waves are as\nacceptable and reasonable as the traditional smooth ones. It is found that the\npeaked solitary waves have some unusual and unique characteristics. First of\nall, they have a peaked crest with a discontinuous vertical velocity at crest.\nEspecially, the phase speed of the peaked solitary waves has nothing to do with\nwave height. In addition, the kinetic energy of the peaked solitary waves\neither increases or almost keeps the same from free surface to bottom. All of\nthese unusual properties show the novelty of the peaked solitary waves,\nalthough it is still an open question whether or not they are reasonable in\nphysics if the viscosity of fluid and surface tension are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 03:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 02:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 03:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2013 05:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2013 02:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-23"}

In contrast, the $\\pi$ exchange does not form the spin-singlet $A_QB_Q$\nbound states. If we consider the heavier scalar and vector meson exchanges as\nwell as the pion exchange, some loosely bound spin-singlet S-wave states appear\nwhile results of the spin-triplet $A_QB_Q$ system does not change\nsignificantly, which implies the pion exchange plays an dominant role in\nforming the spin-triplet molecules. Moreover, we perform an extensive coupled\nchannel analysis of the $\\Lambda_Q\\Lambda_Q$ system within the OPE and\none-boson-exchange (OBE) framework and find that there exist loosely bound\nstates of $\\Lambda_Q\\Lambda_Q$(Q=b,c) with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0(0^+)$,\n$0(0^-)$ and $0(1^-)$. The binding solutions of $\\Lambda_Q\\Lambda_Q$ system\nmainly come from the coupled-channel effect in the flavor space.

In particular, in N = 2 phase, we find that the\nconductance gamma(ky,Eedge(ky)) becomes zero due to interference of two\ndegenerate Majorana edge modes, although the corresponding surface spectral\nweight remains non-zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 07:36:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2012 11:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2012 06:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-13"}

However, the rate of square\nCOD codes decreases exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The\nQuasi-Orthogonal Design (QOD) codes emerged to provide a compromise between\nrate and complexity as they offer higher rates compared to COD codes at the\nexpense of an increase of decoding complexity through partially relaxing the\northogonality conditions. The QOD codes were then generalized with the so\ncalled g-symbol and g-group decodable STBCs where the number of orthogonal\ngroups of symbols is no longer restricted to two as in the QOD case. However,\nthe adopted approach for the construction of such codes is based on sufficient\nbut not necessary conditions which may limit the achievable rates for any\nnumber of orthogonal groups. In this paper, we limit ourselves to the case of\nUnitary Weight (UW)-g-group decodable STBCs for 2^a transmit antennas where the\nweight matrices are required to be single thread matrices with non-zero entries\nin {1,-1,j,-j} and address the problem of finding the highest achievable rate\nfor any number of orthogonal groups. This special type of weight matrices\nguarantees full symbol-wise diversity and subsumes a wide range of existing\ncodes in the literature. We show that in this case an exhaustive search can be\napplied to find the maximum achievable rates for UW-g-group decodable STBCs\nwith g>1. For this purpose, we extend our previously proposed approach for\nconstructing UW-2-group decodable STBCs based on necessary and sufficient\nconditions to the case of UW-g-group decodable STBCs in a recursive manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 07:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

When Robert Shankland\nasked Einstein how he had learned of the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein\ntold him that he had become aware of it through the writings of Lorentz, but\nonly after 1905 had it come to his attention. \"Otherwise\", he said, \"I would\nhave mentioned it in my paper\". He continued to say that the experimental\nresults which had influenced him most were stellar aberration and Fizeau's\nwater tube experiment. \"They were enough\". Indeed the famous Michelson-Morley\nexperiment is not mentioned in the 1905 relativity paper; but curiously\nEinstein did not mention Fizeau's experimental result either, and this is\npuzzling in light of the importance of the experiment in Einstein's pathway to\nhis theory.

These points are constructed by means of an extension of\nDarmon's ATR method to higher dimensional modular abelian varieties, from which\nthey inherit the following features: they are algebraic provided Darmon's\nconjectures on ATR points hold true, and they are explicitly computable, as we\nillustrate with a detailed example that provides certain numerical evidence for\nthe validity of our conjectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 08:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

In this\nrepresentation, the kinematic differential equation reduces to an equation of\nRiccati type, which is solved through appropriate choices of substitutions,\nthereby yielding an analytic solution in terms of confluent hypergeometric\nfunctions. The rotation matrix is recovered from the three complex rotation\nvariables by inverse stereographic map.

Then we investigate statistically the\nrelations between the three power-law indices of the rise, decay and total\nwidth of pulse (denoted as $\\delta_r$, $\\delta_d$ and $\\delta_w$, respectively)\nand the three Band spectral parameters, high-energy index ($\\alpha$),\nlow-energy index ($\\beta$) and peak energy ($E_p$). It is found that\n(1)$\\alpha$ is strongly correlated with $\\delta_w$ and $\\delta_d$ but seems\nuncorrelated with $\\delta_r$; (2)$\\beta$ is weakly correlated with the three\npower-law indices and (3)$E_p$ does not show evident correlations with the\nthree power-law indices. We further investigate the origin of $\\delta_d-\\alpha$\nand $\\delta_w-\\alpha$. We show that the curvature effect and the intrinsic Band\nspectrum could naturally lead to the energy dependence of GRB pulse width and\nalso the $\\delta_d-\\alpha$ and $\\delta_w-\\alpha$ correlations. Our results\nwould hold so long as the shell emitting gamma rays has a curve surface and the\nintrinsic spectrum is a Band spectrum or broken power law. The strong\n$\\delta_d-\\alpha$ correlation and inapparent correlations between $\\delta_r$\nand three Band spectral parameters also suggest that the rise and decay phases\nof GRB pulses have different origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 09:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This paper aims\nto address this gap by proposing a random waypoint (RWP) mobility model defined\non the entire plane and applying it to analyze two key cellular network\nparameters: handover rate and sojourn time. We first analyze the stochastic\nproperties of the proposed model and compare it to two other models: the\nclassical RWP mobility model and a synthetic truncated Levy walk model which is\nconstructed from real mobility trajectories. The comparison shows that the\nproposed RWP mobility model is more appropriate for the mobility simulation in\nemerging cellular networks, which have ever-smaller cells. Then we apply the\nproposed model to cellular networks under both deterministic (hexagonal) and\nrandom (Poisson) base station (BS) models. We present analytic expressions for\nboth handover rate and sojourn time, which have the expected property that the\nhandover rate is proportional to the square root of BS density. Compared to an\nactual BS distribution, we find that the Poisson-Voronoi model is about as\naccurate in terms of mobility evaluation as hexagonal model, though being more\npessimistic in that it predicts a higher handover rate and lower sojourn time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 11:26:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2013 02:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

However, it also introduces problems\nfor a system designer, such as how the amount of money in the system should be\nset. In this paper, the effect of varying the total amount of money in a scrip\nsystem on efficiency (i.e., social welfare---the total utility of all the\nagents in the system) is analyzed, and it is shown that by maintaining the\nappropriate ratio between the total amount of money and the number of agents,\nefficiency is maximized. This ratio can be found by increasing the money supply\nto just below the point that the system would experience a \"monetary crash,\"\nwhere money is sufficiently devalued that no agent is willing to perform a\nservice. The implications of the presence of altruists, hoarders, sybils, and\ncollusion on the performance of the system are examined. Approaches are\ndiscussed to identify the strategies and types of agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 14:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

Prior\nwork (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds the\ncommunication required for learning classifiers while allowing for $\\eps$\ntraining error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed across\nnodes.\n  In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model.\nOur first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocol\nthat uses $O(d^2 \\log{1/\\eps})$ words of communication to classify distributed\ndata in arbitrary dimension $d$, $\\eps$-optimally. This readily extends to\nclassification over $k$ nodes with $O(kd^2 \\log{1/\\eps})$ words of\ncommunication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerably\nmore efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empirical\nresults.\n  In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doing\nefficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solve\nfixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in a\ndistributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Since\nmany learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems where\nconstraints are generated by individual points, this models many typical\ndistributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connection\nfrom multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-update\nframework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, our\nmethods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 15:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

Generally, viscosity and\nthermal conductivity increase with pressure while thermal expansivity\ndecreases, resulting in lower convective vigor in the deep mantle. According to\nconventional thinking, this might result in no convection in a super-Earth's\ndeep mantle. Here we evaluate this. First, we here extend the density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations of post-perovskite activation enthalpy of\nto a pressure of 1 TPa. The activation volume for diffusion creep becomes very\nlow at very high pressure, but nevertheless for the largest super-Earths the\nviscosity along an adiabat may approach 1030 Pa s in the deep mantle. Second,\nwe use these calculated values in numerical simulations of mantle convection\nand lithosphere dynamics of planets with up to ten Earth masses. The models\nassume a compressible mantle including depth-dependence of material properties\nand plastic yielding induced plate tectonics. Results confirm the likelihood of\nplate tectonics and show a novel self-regulation of deep mantle temperature.\nThe deep mantle is not adiabatic; instead internal heating raises the\ntemperature until the viscosity is low enough to facilitate convective loss of\nthe radiogenic heat, which results in a super-adiabatic temperature profile and\na viscosity increase with depth of no more than ~3 orders of magnitude,\nregardless of the viscosity increase that is calculated for an adiabat.\nConvection in large super-Earths is characterised by large upwellings and\nsmall, time-dependent downwellings. If a super-Earth was extremely hot/molten\nafter its formation, it is thus likely that even after billions of years its\ndeep interior is still extremely hot and possibly substantially molten with a\n\"super basal magma ocean\" - a larger version of (Labrosse et al., 2007).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 15:49:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2013 17:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
