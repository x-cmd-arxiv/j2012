This Paper reports the\nHDF detection prior to the flux emergence of NOAA AR 11081, which is located\naway from the disk center. We use SDO/HMI data to study the temporal changes of\nthe Doppler and magnetic patterns from those of the reference quiet Sun. As a\nresult, the HDF appearance is found to come before the flux emergence by about\n100 minutes. Also, the horizontal speed of the HDF during this time gap is\nestimated to be 0.6 to 1.5 km s^-1, up to 2.3 km s^-1. The HDF is caused by the\nplasma escaping horizontally from the rising magnetic flux. And the interval\nbetween the HDF and the flux emergence may reflect the latency during which the\nmagnetic flux beneath the solar surface is waiting for the instability onset to\nthe further emergence. Moreover, SMART Halpha images show that the\nchromospheric plages appear about 14 min later, located co-spatial with the\nphotospheric pores. This indicates that the plages are caused by plasma flowing\ndown along the magnetic fields that connect the pores at their footpoints.

We model the formation of\nchondrules by passage through bow shocks around such a planetary embryo on an\neccentric orbit. We numerically model the hydrodynamics of the flow, and find\nthat such large bodies retain an atmosphere, with Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities allowing mixing of this atmosphere with the gas and particles\nflowing past the embryo. We calculate the trajectories of chondrules flowing\npast the body, and find that they are not accreted by the protoplanet, but may\ninstead flow through volatiles outgassed from the planet's magma ocean. In\ncontrast, chondrules are accreted onto smaller planetesimals. We calculate the\nthermal histories of chondrules passing through the bow shock. We find that\npeak temperatures and cooling rates are consistent with the formation of the\ndominant, porphyritic texture of most chondrules, assuming a modest enhancement\nabove the likely solar nebula average value of chondrule densities (by a factor\nof 10), attributable to settling of chondrule precursors to the midplane of the\ndisk or turbulent concentration. We calculate the rate at which a planetary\nembryo's eccentricity is damped and conclude that a single planetary embryo\nscattered into an eccentric orbit can, over ~ 10e5 years, produce ~ 10e24 g of\nchondrules. In principle, a small number (1-10) of eccentric planetary embryos\ncan melt the observed mass of chondrules in a manner consistent with all known\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 17:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Modification of\nheavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision\nscaling from p+p results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor\n(R_AA), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects.\n  Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, pt, spectra and the corresponding\nR_AA for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at\nsqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and y=1.65.\n  Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor\nmesons into negative muons. The PHENIX muon-arm spectrometers measure the p_T\nspectra of inclusive muon candidates. Backgrounds, primarily due to light\nhadrons, are determined with a Monte-Carlo calculation using a set of input\nhadron distributions tuned to match measured-hadron distributions in the same\ndetector and statistically subtracted.\n  Results: The charm-production cross section in p+p collisions at sqrt{s}=200\nGeV, integrated over pt and in the rapidity range 1.4<y<1.9 is found to be\ndsigma_ccbar/dy = 0.139 +/- 0.029 (stat) ^{+0.051}_{-0.058} (syst) mb. This\nresult is consistent with calculations and with expectations based on the\ncorresponding midrapidity charm-production cross section measured earlier by\nPHENIX. The R_AA for heavy-flavor muons in Cu+Cu collisions is measured in\nthree centrality intervals for 1<pt<4 GeV/c. Suppression relative to\nbinary-collision scaling (R_AA<1) increases with centrality.\n  Conclusions: Within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the measured\nheavy-flavor yield in p+p collisions is consistent with state-of-the-art pQCD\ncalculations. Suppression in central Cu+Cu collisions suggests the presence of\nsignificant cold-nuclear-matter effects and final-state energy loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 18:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

One practical yet challenging scenario is when \\textit{both}\nthe PU occupancy and the channel fading vary over time and exhibit temporal\ncorrelations. Little work has been done for exploiting such temporal memory in\nthe channel fading and the PU occupancy simultaneously for opportunistic\nspectrum scheduling. A main goal of this work is to understand the intricate\ntradeoffs resulting from the interactions of the two sets of system states -\nthe channel fading and the PU occupancy, by casting the problem as a partially\nobservable Markov decision process. We first show that a simple greedy policy\nis optimal in some special cases. To build a clear understanding of the\ntradeoffs, we then introduce a full-observation genie-aided system, where the\nspectrum server collects channel fading states from all PU channels. The\ngenie-aided system is used to decompose the tradeoffs in the original system\ninto multiple tiers, which are examined progressively. Numerical examples\nindicate that the optimal scheduler in the original system, with observation on\nthe scheduled channel only, achieves a performance very close to the\ngenie-aided system. Further, as expected, the optimal policy in the original\nsystem significantly outperforms randomized scheduling, pointing to the merit\nof exploiting the temporal correlation structure in both channel fading and PU\noccupancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 19:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-04"}

We fit a modified-blackbody model\nto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and find\nthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. We\nfind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there is\nno cold dust component. We show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,\nincreasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,\nconsistent with the metallicity gradient. In the 10kpc ring the average beta is\n~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the Milky Way (MW). However,\nin contrast to the MW, we find significant radial variations in beta, which\nincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to\n1.7 in the center. The dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring\n(ranging from 17-20K), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30K. Within\n3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micron\nflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominant\nsource of dust heating there. At larger radii, there is a weak correlation\nbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. We find no evidence for\n'dark gas' in M31 in contrast to recent results for the MW.

A generic problem of using galaxies to constrain cosmology is\nthat galaxies are a biased tracer of the mass distribution, and this bias is\ngenerally unknown.

This latter star\nprovides the first direct link between the formation of stars with enhanced SN\nIa/II ratios in dwarf galaxies to those found in the outer Galactic halo (Ivans\net al. 2003). Another important result is the potential evidence for SN II\ndriven winds. We show that the very metal-poor stars in Carina have not been\nenhanced in AGB or SN Ia products, and therefore their very low ratios of\n[Sr/Ba] suggests the loss of contributions from the early SNe II. Low ratios of\n[Na/Fe], [Mn/Fe], and [Cr/Fe] in two of these stars support this scenario, with\nadditional evidence from the low [Zn/Fe] upper limit for one star. It is\ninteresting that the chemistry of the metal-poor stars in Carina is not similar\nto those in the Galaxy, most of the other dSphs, or the UFDs, and suggests that\nCarina may be at the critical mass where some chemical enrichment events are\nlost through SN II driven winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 20:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluate\nquantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsic\nsignificance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray flux\ndensities of blazars. The novelty of the method lies in a combination of data\nrandomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data are\nintrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significance\nassessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid Malmquist bias and automatically\naccount for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). The method is\napplicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statistical\ncriteria. For larger samples we describe a variation of the method in which the\nsample is split in redshift bins, and the randomization is applied in each bin\nindividually; this variation is designed to yield the equivalent to\nluminosity-function sampling of the underlying population in the limit of very\nlarge, statistically complete samples. We show that for a smaller number of\nredshift bins, the method yields a worse significance, and in this way it is\nconservative in that it does not assign a stronger, artificially enhanced\nsignificance. We demonstrate how our test performs as a function of number of\nsources, strength of correlation, and number of redshift bins used, and we show\nthat while our test is robust against common-distance biases and associated\nfalse positives for uncorrelated data, it retains the power of other methods in\nrejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation for correlated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 20:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 11:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Indeed, while AGN feedback regulates the growth of\nmassive galaxies, its origins can be understood as the spontaneous\nthermodynamic process which ensures that the (Gibbs) free energy of the system\nalways decreases, enabling the galaxy to reach a more energetically favourable\nstate. In particular, it is shown that feedback heating processes will be\nfavoured whenever the hot atmosphere of a galaxy would effectively gain energy\nas a result of cooling. For example, as the hot atmosphere of a galaxy cools\nand contracts, the work done by gravity will be thermalised, with a fraction of\nthe gas also being captured by stars and the supermassive black hole at the\ncentre of the galaxy. If this gain of energy exceeds the loss of energy that\noccurs when cooling gas drops out of the atmosphere, the Gibbs free energy of\nthe system would increase overall. Since this is energetically unfavourable,\nfeedback heating is initiated which acts to reduce the net cooling rate of the\natmosphere, thereby preventing any build-up of energy. The Gibbs free energy\ncan also decrease in the absence of feedback heating, but only if the loss of\nenergy due to mass dropping out of the atmosphere exceeds the gains of energy\ndescribed above. Therefore, to ensure that the Gibbs free energy always\ndecreases, a galaxy will necessarily flip between these two states,\nexperiencing episodes of heating and cooling. Due to the close long-term\nbalance between heating and cooling, the gas in a galaxy will evolve\nquasi-statically towards thermodynamic equilibrium, which has the observable\nappearance of galaxy growth being regulated by AGN feedback. The same mechanism\nalso provides an explanation for why strong AGN feedback occurs more frequently\nin cool-core galaxy clusters than in non cool-core clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 20:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Near the source, magnetic field strengths must be large enough to\ncollimate the jet requiring that the Poynting flux exceeds the kinetic-energy\nflux. The extent to which the Poynting flux dominates kinetic energy flux at\nlarge distances from the engine distinguishes two classes of models. In\nmagneto-centrifugal launch (MCL) models, magnetic fields dominate only at\nscales $\\lesssim 100$ engine radii, after which the jets become\nhydrodynamically dominated (HD). By contrast, in Poynting flux dominated (PFD)\nmagnetic tower models, the field dominates even out to much larger scales. To\ncompare the large distance propagation differences of these two paradigms, we\nperform 3-D ideal MHD AMR simulations of both HD and PFD stellar jets formed\nvia the same energy flux. We also compare how thermal energy losses and\nrotation of the jet base affects the stability in these jets. For the\nconditions described, we show that PFD and HD exhibit observationally\ndistinguishable features: PFD jets are lighter, slower, and less stable than HD\njets. Unlike HD jets, PFD jets develop current-driven instabilities that are\nexacerbated as cooling and rotation increase, resulting in jets that are\nclumpier than those in the HD limit. Our PFD jet simulations also resemble the\nmagnetic towers that have been recently created in laboratory astrophysical jet\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 20:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 13:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This invariant $t$ defines stratifications on moduli spaces of\nsymplectic and orthogonal bundles. We study this stratification by relating it\nto another one given by secant varieties in certain extension spaces.\n  We give a sharp upper bound on $t(V)$, which generalizes the classical Nagata\nbound for ruled surfaces and the Hirschowitz bound for vector bundles, and\nstudy the structure of the stratifications on the moduli spaces. In particular,\nwe compute the dimension of each stratum. We give a geometric interpretation of\nthe number of maximal Lagrangian subbundles of a general symplectic bundle,\nwhen this is finite. We also observe some interesting features of orthogonal\nbundles which do not arise for symplectic bundles, essentially due to the\nricher topological structure of the moduli space in the orthogonal case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 23:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-05"}

Two different approaches to computationally\nefficient, fully explicit, three-dimensional particle-in-cell modelling are\nexamined. First, the Cartesian code VORPAL using a perfect-dispersion\nelectromagnetic solver precisely describes the laser pulse and bubble dynamics,\ntaking advantage of coarser resolution in the propagation direction, with a\nproportionally larger time step. Using third-order splines for macroparticles\nhelps suppress the sampling noise while keeping the usage of computational\nresources modest. The second way to reduce the simulation load is using\nreduced-geometry codes. In our case, the quasi-cylindrical code CALDER-CIRC\nuses decomposition of fields and currents into a set of poloidal modes, while\nthe macroparticles move in the Cartesian 3D space. Cylindrical symmetry of the\ninteraction allows using just two modes, reducing the computational load to\nroughly that of a planar Cartesian simulation while preserving the 3D nature of\nthe interaction. This significant economy of resources allows using fine\nresolution in the direction of propagation and a small time step, making\nnumerical dispersion vanishingly small, together with a large number of\nparticles per cell, enabling good particle statistics. Quantitative agreement\nof the two simulations indicates that they are free of numerical artefacts.\nBoth approaches thus retrieve physically correct evolution of the plasma\nbubble, recovering the intrinsic connection of electron self-injection to the\nnonlinear optical evolution of the driver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 00:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We are given query access to $f:[k]^n \\mapsto \\R$ (for some ordered\nrange $\\R$). The hypergrid/cube has a natural partial order given by\ncoordinate-wise ordering, denoted by $\\prec$. A function is \\emph{monotone} if\nfor all pairs $x \\prec y$, $f(x) \\leq f(y)$. The distance to monotonicity,\n$\\eps_f$, is the minimum fraction of values of $f$ that need to be changed to\nmake $f$ monotone.\n  For $k=2$ (the boolean hypercube), the usual tester is the \\emph{edge\ntester}, which checks monotonicity on adjacent pairs of domain points.

We first present a revised analytic\ncalculation of the neutrino flux, which predicts a flux an order of magnitude\nlower than that obtained by the IceCube collaboration. For benchmark model\nparameters (e.g. the bulk Lorentz factor is \\Gamma=10^{2.5}, the observed\nvariability time for long GRBs is t_v=0.01 s and the ratio between the energy\nin accelerated protons and in radiation is \\eta_p=10 for every burst) in the\nstandard internal shock scenario, the predicted neutrino flux from 215 bursts\nduring the period of the 40-string and 59-string configurations is found to be\na factor of ~3 below the IceCube sensitivity. However, if we accept the\nrecently found inherent relation between the bulk Lorentz factor and burst\nenergy, the expected neutrino flux increases significantly and the spectral\npeak shifts to lower energy. In this case, the non-detection then implies that\nthe baryon loading ratio should be \\eta_p<10 if the variability time of long\nGRBs is fixed to t_v=0.01 s. Instead, if we relax the standard internal shock\nscenario but keep to assume \\eta_p=10, the non-detection constrains the\ndissipation radius to be R>4x10^{12} cm assuming the same dissipation radius\nfor every burst and benchmark parameters for fireballs. We also calculate the\ndiffuse neutrino flux from GRBs for different luminosity functions existing in\nthe literature.

A crucial task is to find the\nmoving objects that travel together. Usually, these object sets are called\nspatio-temporal patterns. Due to the emergence of many different kinds of\nspatio-temporal patterns in recent years, different approaches have been\nproposed to extract them. However, each approach only focuses on mining a\nspecific kind of pattern. In addition to being a painstaking task due to the\nlarge number of algorithms used to mine and manage patterns, it is also time\nconsuming. Moreover, we have to execute these algorithms again whenever new\ndata are added to the existing database. To address these issues, we first\nredefine spatio-temporal patterns in the itemset context. Secondly, we propose\na unifying approach, named GeT_Move, which uses a frequent closed itemset-based\nspatio-temporal pattern-mining algorithm to mine and manage different\nspatio-temporal patterns. GeT_Move is implemented in two versions which are\nGeT_Move and Incremental GeT_Move.

Several new versions of the\nFollow-the-Perturbed-Leader algorithms are presented, as well as methods based\non the Littlestone's dimension, efficient methods for matrix completion with\ntrace norm, and algorithms for the problems of transductive learning and\nprediction with static experts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 05:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-05"}

Measurements were carried out in the mid\ninfrared at room temperature on grains embedded in CsI pellets and in the near\nultraviolet at cryogenic temperature on molecules isolated in Ne matrices. The\ninfrared measurements show that interstellar populations of\npolyynyl-substituted PAHs would give rise to collective features in the same\nway non-substituted PAHs give rise to the aromatic infrared bands. The main\nfeatures characteristic of the substituted molecules correspond to the\nacetylenic CH stretching mode near 3.05 mum and to the almost isoenergetic\nacetylenic CCH in- and out-of-plane bending modes near 15.9 mum.\nSub-populations defined by the length of the polyynyl side group cause\ncollective features which correspond to the various acetylenic CC stretching\nmodes. The ultraviolet spectra reveal that the addition of an ethynyl group to\na non-substituted PAH molecule results in all its electronic transitions being\nredshifted. Due to fast internal energy conversion, the bands at shorter\nwavelengths are significantly broadened. Those at longer wavelengths are only\nbarely affected in this respect. As a consequence, their relative peak\nabsorption increases.

Therefore constraining the tidal dissipation of Saturn (here the\nratio k2/Q) opens the door to the past evolution of the whole system. If\nSaturn's tidal ratio can be determined at different frequencies, it may also be\npossible to constrain the giant planet's interior structure, which is still\nuncertain. Here, we try to determine Saturn's tidal ratio through its current\neffect on the orbits of the main moons, using astrometric data spanning more\nthan a century. We find an intense tidal dissipation (k2/Q= (2.3 \\pm 0.7)\n\\times 10-4), which is about ten times higher than the usual value estimated\nfrom theoretical arguments. As a consequence, eccentricity equilibrium for\nEnceladus can now account for the huge heat emitted from Enceladus' south pole.\nMoreover, the measured k2/Q is found to be poorly sensitive to the tidal\nfrequency, on the short frequency interval considered. This suggests that\nSaturn's dissipation may not be controlled by turbulent friction in the fluid\nenvelope as commonly believed. If correct, the large tidal expansion of the\nmoon orbits due to this strong Saturnian dissipation would be inconsistent with\nthe moon formations 4.5 Byr ago above the synchronous orbit in the Saturnian\nsubnebulae. But it would be compatible with a new model of satellite formation\nin which the Saturnian satellites formed possibly over longer time scale at the\nouter edge of the main rings. In an attempt to take into account for possible\nsignificant torques exerted by the rings on Mimas, we fitted a constant rate\nda/dt on Mimas semi-major axis, also. We obtained an unexpected large\nacceleration related to a negative value of da/dt= -(15.7 \\pm 4.4) \\times 10-15\nau/day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 09:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Boundary of\nvolumes (henceforth envelope) obtained by sweeping solids have been extensively\ninvestigated in the past, though, obtaining an accurate parametrization of the\nenvelope remained computationally hard. The present work reports our approach\nto this problem as well as the important problem of identifying\nself-intersections within the envelope. Parametrization of the envelope is, of\ncourse, necessary for its use in most current CAD systems. We take the more\ninteresting case when the solid is composed of several faces meeting smoothly.\nWe show that the face structure of the envelope mimics locally that of the\nsolid. We adopt the procedural approach at defining the geometry in this work\nwhich has the advantage of being accurate as well as computationally efficient.\nThe problem of detecting local self-intersections is central to a robust\nimplementation of the solid sweep. This has been addressed by computing a\nsubtle mathematical invariant which detects self-intersections, and which is\ncomputationally benign and requires only point queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 10:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-05"}

In the\nCompton-thick hypothesis, however, the emission above 2 keV is mostly due to a\nhighly ionized reflector, contrary to what is usually found in Compton-thick\nSeyfert 2s, where reflection from low ionized matter dominates. Moreover, the\nsource flux varied between the XMM-Newton and the Suzaku observations, taken\n3.5 years apart, confirming previous findings and indicating that the size of\nthe emitting region must be smaller than a parsec.\n  The hard X-ray spectrum is also inconclusive on the Compton-thick hypothesis.\nWeighting the various arguments, a \"true\" Seyfert 2 nature of NGC 3147 seems to\nbe still the most likely explanation, even if the \"highly ionized reflector\"\nCompton-thick hypothesis cannot at present be formally rejected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 13:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Our multiwavelength\ncampaign aims to simultaneously constrain the properties of this X-ray emitting\nplasma, the large scale magnetic field, and the accretion geometry. In this\npaper, we present key results obtained via time-resolved X-ray grating spectra,\ngathered in a 360 ks XMM-Newton observation that covered 2.2 system rotations.\nWe find that the emission lines produced by this high-density plasma display\nperiodic flux variations with a measured period, 1.22+/-0.01 d, that is\nprecisely half that of the binary star system (2.42 d). The observed rotational\nmodulation can be explained assuming that the high-density plasma occupies\nsmall portions of the stellar surfaces, corotating with the stars, and that the\nhigh-density plasma is not azimuthally symmetrically distributed with respect\nto the rotational axis of each star. These results strongly support models in\nwhich high-density, X-ray-emitting CTTS plasma is material heated in accretion\nshocks, located at the base of accretion flows tied to the system by magnetic\nfield lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 15:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}
