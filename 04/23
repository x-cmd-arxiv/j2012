In this work we calculate the\ntime to extinction of isolated populations with fixed number $N$ of individuals\nthat are updated according to the Moran birth and death process. At each time\nstep, one individual is randomly selected and replaced by its offspring\nresulting from mating with another individual of opposite sex; the offspring\ncan be male or female with equal probability. A set of $N$ time steps is called\na generation, the average time it takes for the entire population to be\nreplaced. The number k of females fluctuates in time, similarly to a random\nwalk, and extinction, which is the only asymptotic possibility, occurs when k=0\nor k=N. We show that it takes only one generation for an arbitrary initial\ndistribution of males and females to approach the binomial distribution. This\ndistribution, however, is unstable and the population eventually goes extinct\nin 2^N/N generations.

Furthermore, EHRs are increasingly likely to\ninclude data relating to patient outcomes, functionality such as clinical\ndecision support, and genetic information as well, and, as such, can be seen as\nrepositories of increasingly valuable information about patients' health\nconditions and responses to treatment over time. Methods: We describe a case\nstudy of 423 patients treated by Centerstone within Tennessee and Indiana in\nwhich we utilized electronic health record data to generate predictive\nalgorithms of individual patient treatment response. Multiple models were\nconstructed using predictor variables derived from clinical, financial and\ngeographic data. Results: For the 423 patients, 101 deteriorated, 223 improved\nand in 99 there was no change in clinical condition. Based on modeling of\nvarious clinical indicators at baseline, the highest accuracy in predicting\nindividual patient response ranged from 70-72% within the models tested. In\nterms of individual predictors, the Centerstone Assessment of Recovery Level -\nAdult (CARLA) baseline score was most significant in predicting outcome over\ntime (odds ratio 4.1 + 2.27). Other variables with consistently significant\nimpact on outcome included payer, diagnostic category, location and provision\nof case management services. Conclusions: This approach represents a promising\navenue toward reducing the current gap between research and practice across\nhealthcare, developing data-driven clinical decision support based on\nreal-world populations, and serving as a component of embedded clinical\nartificial intelligences that \"learn\" over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2012 19:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-20"}

We find that the slopes of the Ly-a radial profiles become\nflatter as the Mpc-scale LAE surface densities increase, but they are almost\nindependent of the central UV luminosities. The characteristic exponential\nscale lengths of the Ly-a haloes appear to be proportional to the square of the\nLAE surface densities (r(Lya) \\propto Sigma(LAE)^2). Including the diffuse,\nextended Ly-a haloes, the rest-frame Ly-a equivalent width of the LAEs in the\ndensest regions approaches EW_0(Lya) ~ 200 A, the maximum value expected for\nyoung (< 10^7 yr) galaxies.

Such a transition at $J>0.368|J_1|$ is\ncharacterized by softening of the two-magnon bound-state spectrum. Using a bond\noperator formalism we propose a bosonic representation of the spin Hamiltonian\ncontaining, aside from bosons describing one-magnon spin-1 excitations, a boson\ndescribing spin-2 excitations which spectrum coincides at $H\\ge H_s$ with the\ntwo-magnon bound-state spectrum obtained before. The presence of the bosonic\nmode in the theory that softens at $H=H_s$ makes substantially standard the QPT\nconsideration. In 1D case at $H<H_s$, we find an expression for the\nmagnetization which describes well existing numerical data. Expressions for\nspin correlators are obtained which coincide with those derived before either\nin the limiting case of $J\\gg|J_1|$ or using a phenomenological theory. In\nquasi-1D magnets, we find that the boundary in the $H$--$T$ plane between the\nfully polarized and the nematic phases is given by $H_s(0)-H_s(T)\\propto\nT^{3/2}$. Simple expressions are obtained in the nematic phase for static spin\ncorrelators, spectra of magnons and the soft mode, magnetization and the\nnematic order parameter. All static two-spin correlation functions are short\nranged with the correlation length proportional to $1/\\ln(1+|J_1|/J)$.\nDynamical spin susceptibilities are discussed and it is shown that the soft\nmode can be observed experimentally in the longitudinal channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 07:40:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jun 2012 08:15:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2012 05:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-25"}

Moreover, as bend minimization over all planar embeddings is\nNP-hard, most approaches focus on a fixed planar embedding.\n  We consider the problem OptimalFlexDraw that is defined as follows. Given a\nplanar graph G on n vertices with maximum degree 4 and for each edge e a cost\nfunction cost_e : N_0 --> R defining costs depending on the number of bends on\ne, compute an orthogonal drawing of G of minimum cost.

Similar to the\nexperimental results in the same setup and for the same Prandtl number, the\nstructure of the laminar boundary layers of the velocity and temperature fields\nis found to deviate from the prediction of the Prandtl-Blasius-Pohlhausen\ntheory.

The\nboundary layer dynamics consists of two essential local dynamical building\nblocks, a plume detachment and a post-plume phase. The former is associated\nwith larger variations of the instantaneous thickness of velocity and\ntemperature boundary layer and a fully three-dimensional local flow.

First the\nsemiclassical method is employed to reserve the expression for RKKY interaction\nin clean graphene. Due to the pseudogap at Dirac point, the RKKY coupling in\nundoped grapheme is found to be proportional to $1/R^3$. Next, we investigate\nhow the RKKY interaction depends on nonmagnetic disorder strength and gate\nvoltage by studying numerically the Anderson tight-binding model on a honeycomb\nlattice. We observe that the RKKY interaction along the armchair direction is\nmore robust to nonmagnetic disorder than in other directions. This effect can\nbe explained semiclassically: The presence of multiple shortest paths between\ntwo lattice sites in the armchair directions is found to be responsible for the\nreduceddisorder sensitivity. We also present the distribution of the RKKY\ninteraction for the zigzag and armchair directions. We identify three different\nshapes of the distributions which are repeated periodically along the zigzag\ndirection, while only one kind, and more narrow distribution, is observed along\nthe armchair direction. Moreover, we find that the distribution of amplitudes\nof the RKKY interaction crosses over from a non-Gaussian shape with very long\ntails to a completely log-normal distribution when increasing the nonmagnetic\ndisorder strength. The width of the log-normal distribution is found to\nlinearly increase with the strength of disorder, in agreement with analytical\npredictions. At finite gate voltage near the Dirac point, Friedel oscillation\nappears in addition to the oscillation from the interference between two Dirac\npoints. This results in a beating pattern.

As the\ndumb relays are oblivious to the source and destination nodes, the wireless\nnetwork can be modeled as a relay network with *smart instantaneous relay*\nonly: the signals of source-destination arrive at the same time as\nsource-relay-destination. Recently, instantaneous relaying is shown to improve\nthe degrees-of-freedom of the network as compared to classical cut-set bound.\nIn this paper, we study an achievable rate region and its boundary of the\ninstantaneous interference relay channel in the scenario of (a) uninformed\nnon-cooperative source-destination nodes (source and destination nodes are not\naware of the existence of the relay and are non-cooperative) and (b) informed\nand cooperative source-destination nodes.

One of the goals of these analyses was to investigate\nwhich model is capable of obtaining large mixing induced CP asymmetry in the\nB_s system, S_{psi phi}, and to find out what this would imply for other\nflavour observables. In this context also the rare decays B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^-\nhave been considered. In some models their branching ratios can be enhanced by\norders of magnitude above the SM expectations. The recent data on S_{psi phi}\nand B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- from the LHCb put an end to these very optimistic hopes\nmodifying significantly the allowed patterns of deviations from SM predictions\nfor flavour observables in concrete BSM models. We make a first\nsemi-quantitative assessment of the most important modifications in the\npredictions of the BSM models in question including also recently analyzed\nmodels and taking into account the most recent lattice input. For some BSM\nmodels the LHCb data turned out to be a relief.

Its scientific scope is very broad, but the two main goals\nare the observation of astrophysical sources and the indirect detection of dark\nmatter. The latter is possible through neutrinos produced after the\nannihilation of WIMPs, which would accumulate in sources like the Sun, the\nEarth or the Galactic Centre. The neutralino, which arises in Supersymmetry\nmodels, is one of the most popular WIMP candidates. KK particles, which appear\nin Universal Extra Dimension models, are another one. Though in most models\nthese annihilations would not directly produce neutrinos, they are expected\nfrom the decay of secondary particles. An important advantage of neutrino\ntelescopes with respect to other indirect searches (like gamma rays or cosmic\nrays) is that a potential signal (for instance from the Sun) would be very\nclean, since no other astrophysical explanations could mimic it (like pulsars\nfor the case of the positron excess seen by PAMELA). Moreover, the Galactic\nCentre is accessible for ANTARES, being in the Northern Hemisphere.

A ubiquitous chromospheric downflow is found in the faculae surrounding\nthe filament, with an average velocity of 1.6 km/s.
