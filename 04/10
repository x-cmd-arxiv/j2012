Second, we demonstrate that the deformation processes leading to the\nMACCs have strong chirality dependence. Specifically, armchair GNRs first form\nDNA-like chains, then develop into monatomic chains by passing through an\nintermediate configuration in which monatomic chain sections are separated by\ntwo-atom attachments.

Contrary to this common notion, we show that various well known weaker\nforms of synchronization (almost, time-lag, phase synchronization, and\ngeneralized synchronization) appear as a result of the onset of an almost\nconstant local mean field. If the memory is formed in a brain by minimising the\ncoupling strength among neurons and maximising the number of possible patterns,\nthen the CAS phenomenon is a plausible explanation for it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 17:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-10"}

However, a vast class of researches in this area mainly\nfocus on predicting missing links in bipartite user-item networks (represented\nas behavioral networks). Comparatively, the social impact, especially the\nnetwork structure based properties, is relatively lack of study. In this paper,\nwe firstly obtain five corresponding network-based features, including user\nactivity, average neighbors' degree, clustering coefficient, assortative\ncoefficient and discrimination, from social and behavioral networks,\nrespectively. A hybrid algorithm is proposed to integrate those features from\ntwo respective networks. Subsequently, we employ a machine learning process to\nuse those features to provide recommendation results in a binary classifier\nmethod. Experimental results on a real dataset, Flixster, suggest that the\nproposed method can significantly enhance the algorithmic accuracy. In\naddition, as network-based properties consider not only the social activities,\nbut also take into account user preferences in the behavioral networks,\ntherefore, it performs much better than that from either social or behavioral\nnetworks. Furthermore, since the features based on the behavioral network\ncontain more diverse and meaningfully structural information, they play a vital\nrole in uncovering users' potential preference, which, might show light in\ndeeply understanding the structure and function of the social and behavioral\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 18:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-10"}

In particular, the cell fate decision can depend on the populations\nof two proteins, cI and Cro, as well as their oligomerization and subsequent\nbinding affinities to three DNA sites.

The class of weighted composition operators has an\nimportant place in the theory of Banach spaces of analytic functions; for\ninstance, it includes all isometries on $H^p$ $(p\\neq 2)$. Very recently it was\nshown that only weighted composition operators preserve the class of outer\nfunctions.\n  The present paper considers a particular question motivated by applications:\nWhich smallest possible sets of test functions can be used to identify an\nunknown weighted composition operator? This stems from a practical problem in\nsignal processing, where one seeks to identify an unknown minimum phase\npreserving operator on $L^2(\\real_+)$ using test signals.\n  It is shown in the present paper that functions that determine weighted\ncomposition operators are directly linked to the classical normal family of\nschlicht functions. The main result is that a pair of functions $\\{f,g\\}$\ndistinguishes between any two weighted composition operators if and only if\nthere exists a zero-free function $h$ and a schlicht function $\\sigma$ such\nthat $\\spn\\{f,g\\}=\\spn\\{h\\sigma,h\\}$.

A\nnumber of foundational works both in machine learning and in theory have\nsuggested a probabilistic model for documents, whereby documents arise as a\nconvex combination of (i.e. distribution on) a small number of topic vectors,\neach topic vector being a distribution on words (i.e. a vector of\nword-frequencies). Similar models have since been used in a variety of\napplication areas; the Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA model of Blei et al.\nis especially popular.\n  Theoretical studies of topic modeling focus on learning the model's\nparameters assuming the data is actually generated from it. Existing approaches\nfor the most part rely on Singular Value Decomposition(SVD), and consequently\nhave one of two limitations: these works need to either assume that each\ndocument contains only one topic, or else can only recover the span of the\ntopic vectors instead of the topic vectors themselves.\n  This paper formally justifies Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(NMF) as a main\ntool in this context, which is an analog of SVD where all vectors are\nnonnegative. Using this tool we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for\nlearning topic models without the above two limitations. The algorithm uses a\nfairly mild assumption about the underlying topic matrix called separability,\nwhich is usually found to hold in real-life data. A compelling feature of our\nalgorithm is that it generalizes to models that incorporate topic-topic\ncorrelations, such as the Correlated Topic Model and the Pachinko Allocation\nModel.\n  We hope that this paper will motivate further theoretical results that use\nNMF as a replacement for SVD - just as NMF has come to replace SVD in many\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 19:33:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 01:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-13"}

By comparing synthetic line profiles\nwith HST/STIS spectra obtained near apastron, we show that the WWC cavity has a\nstrong influence on multi-wavelength diagnostics. This influence is regulated\nby the modification of the optical depth in the continuum and spectral lines.\nWe find that H-alpha, H-beta, and Fe II lines are the most affected by the WWC\ncavity, since they form over a large volume of the primary wind. These spectral\nlines depend on latitude and azimuth since, according to the orientation of the\ncavity, different velocity regions of a spectral line are affected. For 2D\nmodels with orientation corresponding to orbital inclination angle 110deg < i <\n140deg and longitude of periastron 210deg < omega < 330deg, the blueshifted and\nzero-velocity regions of the line profiles are the most affected. These orbital\norientations are required to simultaneously fit the UV and optical spectrum of\nEta Car, for a half-opening angle of the cavity in the range 50-70deg. We find\nthat the excess P-Cygni absorption seen in H-alpha, H-beta and optical Fe II\nlines in spherical models becomes much weaker or absent in the 2D models, in\nagreement with the observations. The observed UV spectrum of Eta Car, dominated\nby Fe II absorption lines, is superbly reproduced by our 2D cavity models.\nSmall discrepancies still remain, as H-gamma and H-delta absorptions are\noverestimated by our models.

We report on results from VHE observations\nperformed between 2006-10 with H.E.S.S. H.E.S.S. data have been analysed with\nenhanced analysis methods, making the detection of faint sources more\nsignificant. VHE emission at a position coincident with 1RXS J101015.9-311909\nis detected with H.E.S.S. for the first time. In a total good-quality livetime\nof about 49 h, we measure 263 excess counts, corresponding to a significance of\n7.1\\sigma. The photon spectrum above 0.2 TeV can be described by a power-law\nwith a photon index of \\Gamma\\ = 3.08\\pm0.42_{stat}\\pm0.20_{sys}. The integral\nflux above 0.2 TeV is about 0.8% of the flux of the Crab nebula and shows no\nsignificant variability over the time reported. In addition, public Fermi/LAT\ndata are analysed to search for high energy emission from the source. The\nFermi/LAT HE emission is significant at 8.3\\sigma\\ in the chosen 25-month\ndataset. UV and X-ray contemporaneous observations with the Swift satellite in\nMay 2007 are also reported, together with optical observations performed with\nthe ATOM telescope located at the H.E.S.S. site.

In this paper, we investigate the spatial structure and\nkinematics of the circumprimary disk, with the aim to obtain new insights into\nthe still strongly debated evolutionary stage. For this purpose, we combine,\nfor the first time, infrared spectro-interferometry (VLTI/AMBER, R=12,000) and\nspectro-astrometry (VLT/CRIRES, R=100,000), which allows us to study the\nAU-scale distribution of circumstellar gas and dust with an unprecedented\nvelocity resolution of 3 km*s^-1. Using a model-independent photocenter\nanalysis technique, we find that the Br-gamma-line emission rotates in the same\nplane as the dust disk. We can reproduce the wavelength-differential\nvisibilities and phases and the double-peaked line profile using a\nKeplerian-rotating disk model. The derived mass of the central star is\n5.4+/-0.4 M_sun*(d/1150 pc), which is considerably lower than expected from the\nspectral classification, suggesting that V921 Sco might be more distant (d\napprox 2kpc) than commonly assumed.

The energy of the explosion changes by\nless than \\sim4%.

We demonstrate how directed information\nquantifies Granger causality in a particular sequential prediction setting.

Another algorithm uses\nnear-minimal dimension statistics when no bounds are known but the distribution\nsatisfies a certain criterion.

For sources with spectroscopic\nredshifts at z<0.3, we find a linear correlation between the infrared\nluminosity at 3.4 micron and that at 250 micron, with +-50% scatter over ~1.5\norders of magnitude in luminosity, ~10^9 - 10^{10.5} L_sun. By contrast, the\nmatched sources without previously measured redshifts (r>~20.5) have 250-350\nmicron flux density ratios that suggest either high-redshift galaxies (z>~1.5)\nor optically faint low-redshift galaxies with unusually low temperatures\n(T<~20). Their small 3.4-250 micron flux ratios favor a high-redshift galaxy\npopulation, as only the most actively star-forming galaxies at low redshift\n(e.g., Arp 220) exhibit comparable flux density ratios. Furthermore, we find a\nrelatively large AGN fraction (~30%) in a 12 micron flux-limited subsample of\nH-ATLAS sources, also consistent with there being a significant population of\nhigh-redshift sources in the no-redshift sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 01:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It has been a long standing open problem to design\na local graph clustering algorithm with an approximation guarantee close to the\nguarantee of the Cheeger inequalities and with a running time nearly linear in\nthe size of the output.\n  In this paper we solve this problem; we design an algorithm with the same\nguarantee (up to a constant factor) as the Cheeger inequality, that runs in\ntime slightly super linear in the size of the output. This is the first\nsublinear (in the size of the input) time algorithm with almost the same\nguarantee as the Cheeger's inequality.

In particular, scavenging energy from\nambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently\ndrawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point\nwireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying\nco-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power\nsupplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the\nunintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We\nfurther assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or\nharvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore,\nit is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two\nmodes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the\ninstantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the\noptimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs\nbetween wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we\ndetermine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited\ninformation transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited\ninformation transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the\nreceiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called \"outage-energy\"\nregion and \"rate-energy\" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the\nchannel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the\njoint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer\nscheduling, and the receiver's mode switching.

In this formulation a basic distinction between\nthe conventional \"idealistic\" description of QCD and a more \"realistic\"\ndescription is brought into focus by a non-perturbative, gauge-invariant\nevaluation of the Schwinger solution for the QCD generating functional in terms\nof the exact Fradkin representations of the Green's functional and the vacuum\nfunctional. Because quarks exist asymptotically only in bound states, their\ntransverse coordinates can never be measured with arbitrary precision; the\nnon-perturbative neglect of this statement leads to obstructions that are\neasily corrected by invoking in the basic Lagrangian a probability amplitude\nwhich describes such transverse imprecision.\n  The second result of this non-perturbative analysis is the appearance of a\nnew and simplifying output called \"Effective Locality\", in which the\ninteractions between quarks by the exchange of a \"gluon bundle\" - which\n\"bundle\" contains an infinite number of gluons, including cubic and quartic\ngluon interactions - display an exact locality property that reduces the\nseveral functional integrals of the formulation down to a set of ordinary\nintegrals. It should be emphasized that \"non-perturbative\" here refers to the\neffective summation of all gluons between a pair of quark lines, but does not\n(yet) include a summation over all closed-quark loops which are tied by\ngluon-bundle exchange to the rest of the \"Bundle Diagram\". As an example of the\npower of these methods we offer as a first analytic calculation the\nquark-antiquark binding potential of a pion, and the corresponding three-quark\nbinding potential of a nucleon, obtained in a simple way from relevant eikonal\nscattering approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 04:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

However, by identifying coherent structures\nin their state spaces, i.e., regions of uniform and simpler behavior, we could\nhope to study each of the structures separately and then form the understanding\nof the system as a whole. The method we present in this paper uses trajectory\naverages of scalar functions on the state space to: (a) identify invariant sets\nin the state space, (b) form coherent structures by aggregating invariant sets\nthat are similar across multiple spatial scales. First, we construct the\nergodic quotient, the object obtained by mapping trajectories to the space of\ntrajectory averages of a function basis on the state space. Second, we endow\nthe ergodic quotient with a metric structure that successfully captures how\nsimilar the invariant sets are in the state space. Finally, we parametrize the\nergodic quotient using intrinsic diffusion modes on it. By segmenting the\nergodic quotient based on the diffusion modes, we extract coherent features in\nthe state space of the dynamical system. The algorithm is validated by\nanalyzing the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, which was the test-bed for\nalternative approaches: the Ulam's approximation of the transfer operator and\nthe computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Furthermore, we explain how\nthe method extends the Poincar\\'e map analysis for periodic flows. As a\ndemonstration, we apply the method to a periodically-driven three-dimensional\nHill's vortex flow, discovering unknown coherent structures in its state space.\nIn the end, we discuss differences between the ergodic quotient and\nalternatives, propose a generalization to analysis of (quasi-)periodic\nstructures, and lay out future research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 05:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

The total number of clumps identified in this survey is 91, out of\nwhich 40 (44%) appear dark at 8 and 24 micron. The remaining clumps are\nassociated with mid-IR emission. Many of the identified clumps are massive\nenough to allow high-mass star formation, and some of them already show clear\nsignposts of that. Seven clumps associated with extended-like 4.5 micron\nemission are candidate extended green objects (EGOs). Filamentary dust \"ridges\"\nwere found towards the Spitzer bubbles N10/11 in one of our fields, which\nconforms to the triggered high-mass star formation in the system.

However, since massive stars are usually\nformed in clusters, it would be more realistic to follow the evolution of a\nbubble created by several stars. We develope a two-dimensional (2D) model of\nthe circumstellar bubble created by two massive stars, a 40 solar mass star and\na 25 solar mass star, and follow its evolution. The stars are separated by\napproximately 16 pc and surrounded by a cold medium with a density of 20\nparticles per cubic cm. We use the MPI-AMRVAC hydrodynamics code to solve the\nconservation equations of hydrodynamics on a 2D cylindrical grid using\ntime-dependent models for the wind parameters of the two stars. At the end of\nthe stellar evolution (4.5 and 7.0 million years for the 40 and 25 solar mass\nstars, respectively), we simulate the supernova explosion of each star. Each\nstar initially creates its own bubble. However, as the bubbles expand they\nmerge, creating a combined, aspherical bubble. The combined bubble evolves over\ntime, influenced by the stellar winds and supernova explosions. The evolution\nof a wind-blown bubble created by two stars deviates from that of the bubbles\naround single stars. In particular, once one of the stars has exploded, the\nbubble is too large for the wind of the remaining star to maintain and the\nouter shell starts to disintegrate. The lack of thermal pressure inside the\nbubble also changes the behavior of circumstellar features close to the\nremaining star. The supernovae are contained inside the bubble, which reflects\npart of the energy back into the circumstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 08:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Apr 2012 10:51:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 14:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In the case that\nthe host galaxy dark matter halo is a singular isothermal sphere, we find that\nthe critical CMO mass derived by King, which scales with the halo velocity\ndispersion as M_crit \\propto \\sigma^4, is necessary, but not by itself\nsufficient, to drive shells to large radii in the halo.

Statistical analyses of\nsuch datasets provide two main challenges: First, traditional\nspatial-statistical techniques are often unable to handle large numbers of\nobservations in a computationally feasible way. Second, for large and\nheterogeneous spatial domains, it is often not appropriate to assume that a\nprocess of interest is stationary over the entire domain.\n  We address the first challenge by using a model combining a low-rank\ncomponent, which allows for flexible modeling of medium-to-long-range\ndependence via a set of spatial basis functions, with a tapered remainder\ncomponent, which allows for modeling of local dependence using a compactly\nsupported covariance function. Addressing the second challenge, we propose two\nextensions to this model that result in increased flexibility: First, the model\nis parameterized based on a nonstationary Matern covariance, where the\nparameters vary smoothly across space. Second, in our fully Bayesian model, all\ncomponents and parameters are considered random, including the number,\nlocations, and shapes of the basis functions used in the low-rank component.\n  Using simulated data and a real-world dataset of high-resolution soil\nmeasurements, we show that both extensions can result in substantial\nimprovements over the current state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 10:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 10:03:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 11:28:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 22 Sep 2012 10:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 15:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-26"}

This type of system has\nadvantage over the rest for it is cost efficient as low cost camera is used.\nThe implementation of vision-based vehicle classification system requires lower\ninitial investment cost and very suitable for the toll collection trend\nmigration in Malaysia from single ETC system to full-scale multi-lane free flow\n(MLFF). This project includes the development of an image-based vehicle\nclassification system as an effort to seek for a robust vision-based vehicle\nclassification system. The techniques used in the system include\nscale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique, Canny's edge detector,\nK-means clustering as well as Euclidean distance matching. In this project, a\nunique way to image description as matching medium is proposed. This\ndistinctiveness of method is analogous to the human DNA concept which is highly\nunique. The system is evaluated on open datasets and return promising results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 11:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-11"}

The watershed transform associates to a\ntopographic surface a partition into catchment basins, defined as attraction\nzones of a drop of water falling on the relief and following a line of steepest\ndescent. Unfortunately, catchment basins may overlap and do not form a\npartition. Moreover, current watershed algorithms, being shortsighted, do not\ncorrectly estimate the steepness of the downwards trajectories and overestimate\nthe overlapping zones of catchment basins. An arbitrary division of these zones\nbetween adjacent catchment basin results in a poor localization of the\ncontours. We propose an algorithm without myopia, which considers the total\nlength of a trajectory for estimating its steepness. We first consider\ntopographic surfaces defined on node weighted graphs. The graphs are pruned in\norder to eliminate all downwards trajectories which are not the steepest. An\niterative algorithm with simple neighborhood operations performs the pruning\nand constructs the catchment basins. The algorithm is then adapted to gray tone\nimages. The graph structure itself is encoded as an image thanks to the fixed\nneighborhood structure of grids. A pair of adaptative erosions and dilations\nprune the graph and extend the catchment basins. As a result one obtains a\nprecise detection of the catchment basins and a graph of the steepest\ntrajectories. A last iterative algorithm allows to follow selected downwards\ntrajectories in order to detect particular structures such as rivers or thalweg\nlines of the topographic surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 13:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-11"}

In microcavities, these\nstudies are even more crucial than in the condensates of cold atoms, since\nrandom disorder is naturally present in the semiconductor structures. In this\nchapter, we consider a stable condensate, defined by a chemical potential,\npropagating in a random disorder potential, like a liquid flowing through a\ncapillary. We analyze the interplay between the kinetic energy, the\nlocalization energy, and the interaction between particles in 1D and 2D\npolariton condensates. The finite life time of polaritons is taken into account\nas well. In the first part, we remind the results of [G. Malpuech et al. Phys.\nRev.

In that case, the condensate forms either a glassy insulating phase\nat low polariton density (strong localization), or a superfluid phase above the\npercolation threshold.

The method, which is strictly\nvariational in the limit of infinite lattice-coordination, is quite general and\nflexible, and it is applicable to generic non-equilibrium conditions, even far\nbeyond the linear response regime. As an application, we discuss the quench\ndynamics of a single-band Hubbard model at half-filling, where the method\npredicts a dynamical phase transition above a critical quench that resembles\nthe sharp crossover observed by time-dependent dynamical mean field theory. We\nnext show that one can actually define in some cases a multi-configurational\nwave function combination of a whole set of mutually orthogonal Gutzwiller wave\nfunctions. The Hamiltonian projected in that subspace can be exactly evaluated\nand is equivalent to a model of auxiliary spins coupled to non-interacting\nelectrons, closely related to the slave-spin theories for correlated electron\nmodels. The Gutzwiller approximation turns out to be nothing but the mean-field\napproximation applied to that spin-fermion model, which displays, for any\nnumber of bands and integer fillings, a spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking\nthat can be identified as the Mott insulator-to-metal transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 15:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

How, then, is it possible\nfor organisms to ameliorate mutation-induced perturbations of protein stability\nwhile maintaining biological fitness and gaining a selective advantage? Here we\nused a new technique of site-specific chromosomal mutagenesis to introduce a\nselected set of mostly destabilizing mutations into folA - an essential\nchromosomal gene of E. coli encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) - to\ndetermine how changes in protein stability, activity and abundance affect\nfitness. In total, 27 E.coli strains carrying mutant DHFR were created. We\nfound no significant correlation between protein stability and its catalytic\nactivity nor between catalytic activity and fitness in a limited range of\nvariation of catalytic activity observed in mutants. The stability of these\nmutants is strongly correlated with their intracellular abundance; suggesting\nthat protein homeostatic machinery plays an active role in maintaining\nintracellular concentrations of proteins. Fitness also shows a significant\ncorrelation with intracellular abundance of soluble DHFR in cells growing at\n30oC. At 42oC, on the other hand, the picture was mixed, yet remarkable: a few\nstrains carrying mutant DHFR proteins aggregated rendering them nonviable, but,\nintriguingly, the majority exhibited fitness higher than wild type. We found\nthat mutational destabilization of DHFR proteins in E. coli is counterbalanced\nat 42oC by their soluble oligomerization, thereby restoring structural\nstability and protecting against aggregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 15:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Using the archive {\\sl RXTE} data, we have studied the\nphase-resolved spectral properties of these pulsars in details. The variation\nof the X-ray spectrum with phase of PSR B0531+21 is confirmed here much more\nprecisely and more details are revealed than the previous studies: the spectrum\nsoftens from the beginning of the first pulse, turns to harden right at the\npulse peak and becomes the hardest at the bottom of the bridge, softens\ngradually until the second peak, and then softens rapidly. Different from the\nprevious studies, we found that the spectrum of PSR B1509-58 is significantly\nharder in the center of the pulse, which is also in contrast to that of PSR\nB0531+21. The variation of the X-ray spectrum of PSR B0540-69 seems similar to\nthat of PSR B1509-58, but with a lower significance. Using the about 10 years\nof data span, we also studied the real time evolution of the spectra of these\npulsars, and no significant evolution has been detected.
