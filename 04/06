Since the density of states for the electrons changes due to\nthe presence of the magnetic field (which gives rise to Landau quantization),\nthe corresponding equation of state also gets modified. In order to investigate\nthe effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a\nmaximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied. This is\nimportant since, if a very large number of Landau levels are filled, it implies\na very low magnetic field strength which yields back Chandrasekhar's celebrated\nnon-magnetic results. The maximum number of occupied Landau levels is fixed by\nthe correct choice of two parameters, namely the magnetic field strength and\nthe maximum Fermi energy of the system. We study the equations of state of\nthese one-level, two-level and three-level systems and compare them by taking\nthree different maximum Fermi energies. We also find the effect of the strong\nmagnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the underlying star composed of\nthe gas stated above. We obtain an exciting result that, it is possible to have\nan electron degenerate static star, namely magnetized white dwarfs, with a mass\nsignificantly greater than the Chandrasekhar limit in the range 2.3-2.6M_Sun,\nprovided it has an appropriate magnetic field strength and central density. In\nfact, recent observations of peculiar Type Ia supernovae - SN 2006gz, SN\n2007if, SN 2009dc, SN 2003fg - seem to suggest super-Chandrasekhar-mass white\ndwarfs with masses up to 2.4-2.8M_Sun, as their most likely progenitors.\nInterestingly our results seem to lie within the observational limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 16:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2012 05:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-08"}

Assuming that the weak-field limit holds and the dynamical system\nis conservative an elementary treatment of the problem based on the laws of\nenergy and momentum conservation shows that the system can be accelerated\nindefinitely, or attain very large asymptotic values of the Lorentz factor\n$\\gamma$. The system experiences indefinite acceleration when its\nenergy-momentum vector is null and the mass difference $\\Delta \\mu \\le 0$. When\nmodulus of the square of the norm of the energy-momentum vector, $|N^2|$, is\nsufficiently small the system can be accelerated to very large $\\gamma \\propto\n|N^2|^{-1}$. It is stressed that when only leading terms in the ratio of a\ncharacteristic gravitational radius to the distance between the particles are\nretained our elementary analysis leads to equations of motion equivalent to\nthose derived from relativistic weak-field equations of motion of Havas and\nGoldberg 1962. Thus, in the weak-field approximation, it is possible to bring\nthe system to the state with extremely high values of $\\gamma$.

Suppose that\nthere is a process of production of such pairs and the particles with positive\nmass are intercepted while the negative mass particles are expelled from the\nregion of space occupied by physical bodies of interest. This scheme could\nprovide a persistent transfer of positive energy to the bodies, which may be\nclassified as a 'Perpetuum Motion of Third Kind'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 16:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jun 2012 12:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Therefore, the ratio of gas pressure\nto total pressure (beta) and the underlying polytropic index (gamma) should not\nbe constant throughout the flow.

The terms are\nproducts of a polynomial in the edge density a of the color graph and the\nnumber of colorings of the indexing subgraph of the domain into the\ncomplementary color graph. The polynomial in a is independent of the color\ngroup and the term has order (1-a) to the r where r is the number of vertices\nminus the number of components in the indexing subgraph.

The rather small difference in\nradial distance, and the fact that they also show a close projected distance on\nthe sky, has led to the idea that we might be seeing a new pair of bound\ngalaxies - like the Magellanic Clouds. In this paper we investigate this\nspeculation by means of a simple integration code (confirming the results with\nfull N-body simulations). As the luminous mass of both faint dwarfs is far too\nlow to allow them to be bound, we simulate the pair assuming extended dark\nmatter haloes. Our results show that the minimum dark matter mass required for\nthe pair to be bound is rather high - ranging from 1.6 x 10^10 Msun to 5.4 x\n10^10 Msun (within the virial radii). Computing the mass of dark matter within\na commonly adopted radius of 300 pc shows that our models are well within the\npredicted range of dark matter content for satellites so faint. We therefore\nconclude that it could be possible that the two galaxies constitute a bound\npair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 17:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A sample of 31\npowerful classical double radio sources with previously determined beam and\nradio powers are studied; the sources have redshifts between about 0.056 and\n1.8.

Controversial photoemission data taken in the\nsuperconducting state [2-7] are in conflict with highly magnetic state seen by\nneutron-, muSR-spectroscopies and transport/thermodynamic probes [8-10]. These\nresults lead to suggestions to consider all iron-based materials as originating\nfrom Mott-insulators or semiconductors, thus once again raising the question of\nclose relation between the cuprates and Fe-based superconductors [e.g. 2]. Here\nwe study electronic and magnetic properties of Rb0.77Fe1.61Se2 (Tc = 32.6 K) in\nnormal and superconducting states by means of photoemission and muSR\nspectroscopies as well as band structure calculations. We demonstrate that the\npuzzling behavior of these novel materials is the result of separation into\nmetallic (~12%) and insulating (~ 88%) phases. Only the former becomes\nsuperconducting and has a usual electronic structure of electron-doped\nFeSe-slabs. Our results thus imply that the antiferromagnetic insulating phase\nis just a byproduct of Rb-intercalation and its magnetic properties have hardly\nany relation to the superconductivity. Instead, we find that also in this,\nalready third class of iron-based compounds, the key ingredient for\nsuperconductivity is a certain proximity of a van Hove singularity to the Fermi\nlevel. These findings set the direction for effective search of new\nsuperconducting materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 19:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-10"}

Assuming a universal spherically-symmetric\nGeneralised Navarro, Frenk & White (GNFW) model for the cluster gas pressure\nprofile, we jointly constrain the integrated Compton-Y parameter (Y_500) and\nthe scale radius (theta_500) of each cluster. Our resulting constraints in the\nY_500-theta_500 2D parameter space derived from the two instruments overlap\nsignificantly for eight of the clusters, although, overall, there is a tendency\nfor AMI to find the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal to be smaller in angular size and\nfainter than Planck. Significant discrepancies exist for the three remaining\nclusters in the sample, namely A1413, A1914, and the newly-discovered Planck\ncluster PLCKESZ G139.59+24.18. The robustness of the analysis of both the\nPlanck and AMI data is demonstrated through the use of detailed simulations,\nwhich also discount confusion from residual point (radio) sources and from\ndiffuse astrophysical foregrounds as possible explanations for the\ndiscrepancies found. For a subset of our cluster sample, we have investigated\nthe dependence of our results on the assumed pressure profile by repeating the\nanalysis adopting the best-fitting GNFW profile shape which best matches X-ray\nobservations. Adopting the best-fitting profile shape from the X-ray data does\nnot, in general, resolve the discrepancies found in this subset of five\nclusters. Though based on a small sample, our results suggest that the adopted\nGNFW model may not be sufficiently flexible to describe clusters universally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 19:33:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 May 2012 13:21:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 May 2012 11:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In contrast, in agglomerative percolation (AP)\nclusters grow by choosing randomly a `target cluster' and joining it with all\nits neighbors, as defined by the same set of virtual links. Previous studies\nshowed that AP is in different universality classes from OP for several types\nof (virtual) networks (linear chains, trees, Erdos-Renyi networks), but most\nsurprising were the results for 2-d lattices: While AP on the triangular\nlattice was found to be in the OP universality class, it behaved completely\ndifferently on the square lattice. In the present paper we explain this\nstriking violation of universality by invoking bipartivity. While the square\nlattice is a bipartite graph, the triangular lattice is not. In conformity with\nthis we show that AP on the honeycomb and simple cubic (3-d) lattices -- both\nof which are bipartite -- are also not in the OP universality classes. More\nprecisely, we claim that this violation of universality is basically due to a\nZ_2 symmetry that is spontaneously broken at the percolation threshold.

The eclipses are caused by a\ncircumbinary disk seen nearly edge on, which at the epoch of these observations\ncompletely obscured the orbit of star B and a large portion of the orbit of\nstar A.

The H$\\alpha$ line profile shows\ndramatic changes in these time series data over timescales ranging from days to\nyears. A fraction of the variations are due to \"edge effects\" and depend only\non the height of star A above or below the razor sharp edge of the occulting\ndisk.

Some of the neutrino\noscillation data is statistically poor and cannot be treated by normal\n(Gaussian) statistics. To extract confidence intervals when the statistics are\nnot normal, one should not utilize the value for chisquare versus confidence\nlevel taken from normal statistics. Instead, we propose that one should use the\nnormalized likelihood function as a probability distribution; the relationship\nbetween the correct chisquare and a given confidence level can be computed by\nintegrating over the likelihood function. This allows for a definition of\nconfidence level independent of the functional form of the !2 function; it is\nparticularly useful for cases in which the minimum of the !2 function is near a\nboundary. We present two pedagogic examples and find that the proposed method\nyields confidence intervals that can differ significantly from those obtained\nby using the value of chisquare from normal statistics. For example, we find\nthat for the first data release of the T2K experiment the probability that\nchisquare is not zero, as defined by the maximum confidence level at which the\nvalue of zero is not allowed, is 92%.

The\nmultiwavelength analysis reveals the presence of multithermal strands in the\noscillating loop, whose dynamic behaviors are temperature-dependent, showing\ndifferences in their oscillation amplitudes, phases and emission evolution. The\nphysical parameters of growing oscillations of two strands in 171 A are\nmeasured and the 3-D loop geometry is determined using STEREO-A/EUVI data.\nThese strands have very similar frequencies, and between two 193 A strands a\nquarter-period phase delay sets up.

Our results reveal a most unusual object. By examining\nobservational data taken by IRAS, Akari and WISE between 11.5 and 60 microns,\nalong with variations in its optical lightcurve, we find Anchises is most\nlikely an elongated body, with an axes-ratio of ~1.4. This yields calculated\nbest-fit dimensions of 170x121x121km (an equivalent diameter of 136+18/-11km).\nWe find the observations are best fit by Anchises having a retrograde sense of\nrotation, and an unusually high thermal inertia (25 to 100 Jm-2s-0.5K-1). The\ngeometric albedo is found to be 0.027 (+0.006/-0.007). Anchises therefore has\none of the highest published thermal inertias of any object larger than 100km\nin diameter, at such large heliocentric distances, and is one of the lowest\nalbedo objects ever observed. More observations are needed to see if there is a\nlink between the very shallow phase curve, with almost no opposition effect,\nand the derived thermal properties for this large Trojan asteroid. Our\ndynamical investigation of Anchises' orbit has revealed it to be dynamically\nunstable on timescales of hundreds of Myr, similar to the unstable Neptunian\nTrojans 2001 QR322 and 2008 LC18. Unlike those objects, we find that Anchises'\ndynamical stability is not a function of its initial orbital elements, the\nresult of the exceptional precision with which its orbit is known. This is the\nfirst time that a Jovian Trojan has been shown to be dynamically unstable, and\nadds weight to the idea that planetary Trojans represent a significant ongoing\ncontribution to the Centaur population, the parents of the short-period comets.\nThe observed instability does not rule out a primordial origin for Anchises,\nbut when taken in concert with the result of our thermophysical analysis,\nsuggest that it would be a fascinating target for future study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 01:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

For example, by using the conventional way of setting $\\mu_r \\in\n[m_t/2,2m_t]$, one obtains the total $t \\bar{t}$ production cross-section\n$\\sigma_{t \\bar{t}}$ with the uncertainty $\\Delta \\sigma_{t \\bar{t}}/\\sigma_{t\n\\bar{t}}\\sim ({}^{+3%}_{-4%})$ at the Tevatron and LHC even for the present\nNNLO level. The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) eliminates the\nrenormalization scale ambiguity in precision tests of Abelian QED and\nnon-Abelian QCD theories. In this paper we apply PMC scale-setting to predict\nthe $t \\bar t$ cross-section $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ at the Tevatron and LHC\ncolliders. It is found that $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ remains almost unchanged by\nvarying $\\mu^{\\rm init}_r$ within the region of $[m_t/4,4m_t]$. The convergence\nof the expansion series is greatly improved. For the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel,\nwhich is dominant at the Tevatron, its NLO PMC scale is much smaller than the\ntop-quark mass in the small $x$-region, and thus its NLO cross-section is\nincreased by about a factor of two. In the case of the $(gg)$-channel, which is\ndominant at the LHC, its NLO PMC scale slightly increases with the subprocess\ncollision energy $\\sqrt{s}$, but it is still smaller than $m_t$ for\n$\\sqrt{s}\\lesssim 1$ TeV, and the resulting NLO cross-section is increased by\n$\\sim 20%$. As a result, a larger $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ is obtained in comparison\nto the conventional scale-setting method, which agrees well with the present\nTevatron and LHC data.

It is empirically known to be\ndifficult to access low temperature and nonzero chemical potential $\\mu$\nregions in lattice QCD simulations. We address this issue in a lattice QCD with\nthe use of a dimensional reduction formula of the fermion determinant.\n  We investigate spectral properties of a reduced matrix of the reduction\nformula. Lattice simulations with different lattice sizes show that the\neigenvalues of the reduced matrix follow a scaling law for the temporal size\n$N_t$. The properties of the fermion determinant are examined using the\nreduction formula. We find that as a consequence of the $N_t$ scaling law, the\nfermion determinant becomes insensitive to $\\mu$ as $T$ decreases, and\n$\\mu$-independent at T=0 for $\\mu<m_\\pi/2$.\n  The $N_t$ scaling law provides two types of the low temperature limit of the\nfermion determinant: (i) for low density and (ii) for high-density. The fermion\ndeterminant becomes real and the theory is free from the sign problem in both\ncases. In case of (ii), QCD approaches to a theory, where quarks interact only\nin spatial directions, and gluons interact via the ordinary Yang-Mills action.\nThe partition function becomes exactly $Z_3$ invariant even in the presence of\ndynamical quarks because of the absence of the temporal interaction of quarks.\n  The reduction formula is also applied to the canonical formalism and Lee-Yang\nzero theorem. We find characteristic temperature dependences of the canonical\ndistribution and of Lee-Yang zero trajectory.

This makes it well suited for an extensive\nobservation of neutrinos produced in astrophysical transient sources. In the\nsurrounding medium of blazars, i.e. active galactic nuclei with their jets\npointing almost directly towards the observer, neutrinos may be produced\ntogether with gamma-rays by hadronic interactions, so a strong correlation\nbetween neutrinos and gamma-rays emissions is expected. The time variability\ninformation of the studied source can be obtained by the gamma-ray light curves\nmeasured by the LAT instrument on-board the Fermi satellite. If the expected\nneutrino flux observation is reduced to a narrow window around the assumed\nneutrino production period, the point-source sensitivity can be drastically\nimproved. The ANTARES data collected in 2008 has been analysed looking for\nneutrinos detected in the high state period of ten bright and variable Fermi\nsources assuming that the neutrino emission follows the gamma-ray light curves.\nFirst results show a sensitivity improvement by a factor 2-3 with respect to a\nstandard time-integrated point source search. The analysis has been done with\nan unbinned method based on the minimization of a likelihood ratio applied to\ndata corresponding to a live time of 60 days. The width of the flaring periods\nranges from 1 to 20 days. Despite the fact that the most significant studied\nsource is compatible with background fluctuations, recently detected flares\npromise interesting future analyse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 11:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

The question\nof the existence of odd perfect numbers (OPNs) is one of the longest unsolved\nproblems of number theory. This thesis presents some of the old as well as new\napproaches to solving the OPN Problem. In particular, a conjecture predicting\nan injective and surjective mapping $X = \\sigma(p^k)/p^k, Y = \\sigma(m^2)/m^2$\nbetween OPNs $N = {p^k}{m^2}$ (with Euler factor $p^k$) and rational points on\nthe hyperbolic arc $XY = 2$ with $1 < X < 1.25 < 1.6 < Y < 2$ and $2.85 < X + Y\n< 3$, is disproved. Various results on the abundancy index and solitary numbers\nare used in the disproof. Numerical evidence against the said conjecture will\nlikewise be discussed. We will show that if an OPN $N$ has the form above, then\n$p^k < (2/3){m^2}$ follows from \\cite{D10}. We will also attempt to prove a\nconjectured improvement of this last result to $p^k < m$ by observing that\n$\\sigma(p^k)/m \\neq 1$ and $\\sigma(p^k)/m \\neq \\sigma(m)/p^k$ in all cases.\nLastly, we also prove the following generalization: If $N =\n\\displaystyle\\prod_{i=1}^r {{p_i}^{{\\alpha}_i}}$ is the canonical factorization\nof an OPN $N$, then $$\\sigma({p_i}^{{\\alpha}_i}) \\leq\n(2/3){\\frac{N}{{p_i}^{{\\alpha}_i}}}$$ for all $i$. This gives rise to the\ninequality $$N^{2 - r} \\leq (1/3)(2/3)^{r - 1}$$ which is true for all $r$,\nwhere $r = \\omega(N)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $N$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 11:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 22:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-04"}

Although the constraints which are\npresent in this theory prevent it from admitting the flat and closed FRW models\nas its cosmological solutions, for the open FRW universe, it is not the case.\nWe have shown that, either in the absence of matter or in the presence of a\nperfect fluid, the classical field equations of such a theory adopt physical\nsolutions for the open FRW model, in which the mass term shows itself as a\ncosmological constant. These classical solutions consist of two distinguishable\nbranches: One is a contacting universe which tends to a future singularity with\nzero size, while another is an expanding universe having a past singularity\nfrom which it begins its evolution. A classically forbidden region separates\nthese two branches from each other. We then employ the familiar canonical\nquantization procedure in the given cosmological setting to find the\ncosmological wave functions. We use the resulting wave function to investigate\nthe possibility of the avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum\neffects. It is shown that the quantum expectation values of the scale factor,\nalthough they have either contracting or expanding phases like their classical\ncounterparts, are not disconnected from each other. Indeed, the classically\nforbidden region may be replaced by a bouncing period in which the scale factor\nbounces from the contraction to its expansion eras. Using the Bohmian approach\nof quantum mechanics, we also compute the Bohmian trajectory and the quantum\npotential related to the system, which their analysis shows are the direct\neffects of the mass term on the dynamics of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 11:42:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2012 19:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The tidal dissipation of such solid regions,\ngravitationally perturbed by a companion body, highly depends on their rheology\nand on the tidal frequency. Therefore, modelling tidal interactions presents a\nhigh interest to provide constraints on planets' properties and to understand\ntheir history and their evolution, in our Solar System or in exoplanetary\nsystems. We examine the equilibrium tide in the anelastic parts of a planet\nwhatever the rheology, taking into account the presence of a fluid envelope of\nconstant density. We show how to obtain the different Love numbers that\ndescribe its tidal deformation. Thus, we discuss how the tidal dissipation in\nsolid parts depends on the planet's internal structure and rheology. Finally,\nwe show how the results may be implemented to describe the dynamical evolution\nof planetary systems. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the planet adiabatically along the line of centers. Then, the response\npotential of the body to the tidal potential defines the complex Love numbers\nwhose real part corresponds to the purely adiabatic elastic deformation, while\nits imaginary part accounts for dissipation. This dissipation is responsible\nfor the imaginary part of the disturbing function, which is implemented in the\ndynamical evolution equations, from which we derive the characteristic\nevolution times. The rate at which the system evolves depends on the physical\nproperties of tidal dissipation, and specifically on how the shear modulus\nvaries with tidal frequency, on the radius and also the rheological properties\nof the solid core. The quantification of the tidal dissipation in solid cores\nof giant planets reveals a possible high dissipation which may compete with\ndissipation in fluid layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 12:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Simple calculations suggest too low a slope and too\nhigh a scatter, and recent semi-analytic models and numerical galaxy\nsimulations typically fail to reproduce some aspects of the relation.\nFurthermore, the assumptions underlying one model are often inconsistent with\nthose behind another. This paper aims to develop a rigorous prediction for the\nBTFR in the context of LCDM, using only a priori expected effects and\nrelations, a minimum of theoretical assumptions, and no free parameters. The\nrobustness of the relation to changes in key galactic parameters will be\nexplored. I adopt a modular approach, taking each of the stand alone galaxy\nrelations necessary for constructing the BTFR from up-to-date numerical\nsimulations of dark halos. These relations -- and their expected scatter -- are\nused to describe model spirals with a range of masses, resulting in a band in\nthe space of the BTFR that represents the current best guess for the LCDM\nprediction. Consistent treatment of expected LCDM effects goes a large way\ntowards reconciling the naive slope-3 LCDM prediction with the data, especially\nin the range 10^9 M_sun < M_bar < 10^11 M_sun. The theoretical BTFR becomes\nsignificantly curved at M_bar > 10^11 M_sun, but this is difficult to test\nobservationally due to the scarcity of extremely high mass spirals. Low mass\ngas-rich galaxies have systematically lower rotational velocity than the LCDM\nprediction, although the relation used to describe baryon mass fractions must\nbe extrapolated in this regime. The fact that the BTFR slope derived here is\nsignificantly greater than in early predictions is a direct consequence of a\ncorresponding increase in the expected sensitivity of baryon mass fraction to\ntotal halo mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 15:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 12:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}
