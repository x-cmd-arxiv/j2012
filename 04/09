Accretion flow plays an important role in black hole physics in\nidentifying the existence of the underlying black hole. This is a rotating\nshear flow with insignificant molecular viscosity, which could however have a\nsignificant turbulent viscosity, generating transport, heat and hence entropy\nin the flow. However, in presence of strong magnetic field, magnetic stresses\ncan help in transporting matter independent of viscosity, via celebrated\nBlandford-Payne mechanism. In such cases, energy and then entropy produces via\nOhmic dissipation. In addition, certain optically thin, hot, accretion flows,\nof temperature >~ 10^9K, may be favourable for nuclear burning which could\ngenerate/absorb huge energy, much higher than that in a star. We find that\neta/s in accretion flows appears to be close to the lower bound suggested by\ntheory, if they are embedded by strong magnetic field or producing nuclear\nenergy, when the source of energy is not viscous effects.

Keys to this program are techniques to\nextract the faint cosmological signal from various contaminants, such as\ndetector noise and continuum foregrounds.

Based on the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of 1376 galaxies brighter than iBATC = 19:5, photometric redshift\ntechnique and the color-magnitude relation of earlytype galaxies are applied to\nselect faint member galaxies. As a result, 117 faint galaxies were selected as\nnew member galaxies. Combined with sample I, an enlarged sample (called sample\nII) of 355 member galaxies is obtained. Spatial distribution and localized\nvelocity structure for two samples demonstrate that A119 is a dynamically\ncomplex cluster with at least three prominent substructures in the central\nregion within 1 Mpc. A large velocity dispersion for the central clump\nindicates a merging along the line of sight. No significant evidences for\nmorphology and luminosity segregations are found in both samples. With the\nevolutionary synthesis model PEGASE, environmental effect on the star formation\nproperties is confirmed. Faint galaxies in low-density region tend to have\nlonger time scales of star formation, smaller mean stellar ages, and lower\nmetallicities of interstellar medium, which is in agreement with the context of\nhierarchical cosmological scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 09:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The formation\nof a deformed, oscillating, differentially rotating very massive NS is the\ntypical outcome of the coalescence of two stars with 1.35 $M_{\\odot}$ for most\ncandidate EoSs. The oscillations of this object imprint a pronounced peak in\nthe gravitational-wave (GW) spectra, which is used to characterize the emission\nfor a given model. The peak frequency of this postmerger GW signal correlates\nvery well with the radii of nonrotating NSs, and thus allows to constrain the\nhigh-density EoS by a GW detection. In the case of 1.35-1.35 $M_{\\odot}$\nmergers the peak frequency scales particularly well with the radius of a NS\nwith 1.6 $M_{\\odot}$, where the maximum deviation from this correlation is only\n60 meters for fully microphysical EoSs which are compatible with NS\nobservations. Combined with the uncertainty in the determination of the peak\nfrequency it appears likely that a GW detection can measure the radius of a 1.6\n$M_{\\odot}$ NS with an accuracy of about 100 to 200 meters. We also uncover\nrelations of the peak frequency with the radii of nonrotating NSs with 1.35\n$M_{\\odot}$ or 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$, with the radius or the central energy density\nof the maximum-mass Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff configuration, and with the\npressure or sound speed at a fiducial rest-mass density of about twice nuclear\nsaturation density. Furthermore, it is found that a determination of the\ndominant postmerger GW frequency can provide an upper limit for the maximum\nmass of nonrotating NSs. The prospects for a detection of the postmerger GW\nsignal and a determination of the dominant GW frequency are estimated to be in\nthe range of 0.015 to 1.2 events per year with the upcoming Advanced LIGO\ndetector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2012 14:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 06:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The dynamics under the\ninfluence of amplitude damping, depolarizing and phase flip channels is\ndiscussed. It is worth-noting that initial state entanglement plays an\nimportant role in bipartite states. It is possible to distinguish the Bell,\nWerner and general type initial quantum states using GMQD. Sudden transition in\nthe behaviour of GMQD and MIN occurs depending upon the mean photon number of\nthe local environment. The transition behaviour disappears for larger values of\nn, i.e. n>0.3.

The gravitational field of our Galaxy can be inferred from\nobservation of orbital velocities of the visible stars, in a first\napproximation in which the field is taken to be due to the distribution of dark\nmatter only. An equation of state is determined by the gravitational field via\nthe equations of motion.\n  To arrive at an estimate of the distribution of dark matter in our galaxy,\nand simultaneously learn something about the gravitational field in the inner\nregions, the following strategy was adopted: 1. The observed rotation curves\nsuggest an expression for the newtonian potential, valid in the outer region.\n2. The assumption of a quasi stationary, spherically symmetric distribution of\ndark matter then leads to a unique equation of state. 3. This equation of state\nis assumed to be valid all the way to the center (though of course the\nnewtonian approximation is not). 4. Using this equation of state, together with\nEinstein's equations and the relativistic hydrostatic condition, we calculate\nthe metric and the matter density throughout the galaxy. The solutions are\nregular all the way to the center; there is no indication of a structure of the\ntype of a Black Hole.\n  The equation of state that is thus determined experimentally is of the type\nused by Chandrasekhar and others for the degenerate Fermi gas.
