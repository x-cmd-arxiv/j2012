In photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), Polycyclic Aromatic\nHydrocarbons (PAHs) could be produced by evaporation of Very Small Grains\n(VSGs) by the impinging UV radiation field from a nearby star. Aims. We\ninvestigate quantitatively the transition zone between evaporating Very Small\nGrains (eVSGs) and PAHs in several PDRs. Methods. We study the relative\ncontribution of PAHs and eVSGs to the mid-IR emission in a wide range of\nexcitation conditions.

We show a clear decrease of f_eVSG with\nincreasing intensity of the local UV radiation field, which supports the\nscenario of photo-destruction of eVSGs. Conversely, this dependence can be used\nto quantify the intensity of the UV radiation field for different PDRs,\nincluding non resolved ones. Conclusions.

In order to study the structure of the subvarieties of\nDA, Trotter and Weil considered the intersection of varieties of finite monoids\nwith bands, i.e., with idempotent monoids. The varieties of idempotent monoids\nare very well understood and fully classified. Trotter and Weil showed that for\nevery band variety V there exists a unique maximal variety W inside DA such\nthat the intersection with bands yields the given band variety V. These maximal\nvarieties W define the Trotter-Weil hierarchy. This hierarchy is infinite and\nit exhausts DA; induced by band varieties, it naturally has a zigzag shape. In\ntheir paper, Trotter and Weil have shown that the corners and the intersection\nlevels of this hierarchy are decidable.\n  In this paper, we give a single identity of omega-terms for every join level\nof the Trotter-Weil hierarchy; this yields decidability.

Without\ntuning, the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs is peaked towards the\nIR tip of the space and hence such a scenario still offers a potential\nresolution to the gauge-hierarchy problem. When the exponent of the Higgs VEV\nis approximately two and one assumes order one Yukawa couplings, then the\nfermion Dirac mass term is found to range from $\\sim 10^{-5}$ eV to $\\sim 200$\nGeV in approximate agreement with the observed fermion masses. However, this\nresult is sensitive to the exponent of the Higgs VEV, which is a free\nparameter. This paper offers a number of phenomenological and theoretical\nmotivations for considering an exponent of two to be the optimal value. In\nparticular, the exponent is bounded from below by the Breitenlohner-Freedman\nbound and the requirement that the dual theory resolves the gauge hierarchy\nproblem. While, in the model considered, if the exponent is too large,\nelectroweak symmetry may not be broken. In addition, the holographic method is\nused to demonstrate, in generality, that the flatter the Higgs VEV, the smaller\nthe contribution to the electroweak $T$ parameter. In addition, the constraints\nfrom a large class of gauge mediated and scalar mediated flavour changing\nneutral currents, will be at minimal values for flatter Higgs VEVs.

In this paper, we present an approach to foreground removal that\nexplicitly accounts for this frequency dependence. We apply the delay\ntransformation introduced in Parsons & Backer (2009) to each baseline of an\ninterferometer to concentrate smooth-spectrum foregrounds within the bounds of\nthe maximum geometric delays physically realizable on that baseline. By\nfocusing on delay-modes that correspond to image-domain regions beyond the\nhorizon, we show that it is possible to avoid the bulk of smooth-spectrum\nforegrounds. We map the point-spread function of delay-modes to k-space,\nshowing that delay-modes that are uncorrupted by foregrounds also represent\nsamples of the three-dimensional power spectrum, and can be used to constrain\ncosmic reionization. Because it uses only spectral smoothness to differentiate\nforegrounds from the targeted 21cm signature, this per-baseline analysis\napproach relies on spectrally- and spatially-smooth instrumental responses for\nforeground removal. For sufficient levels of instrumental smoothness relative\nto interfering foregrounds, this technique substantially reduces the level of\ncalibration previously thought necessary to detect 21cm reionization. As a\nresult, this approach places fewer constraints on antenna configuration within\nan array, facilitating the adoption of configurations optimized for\npower-spectrum sensitivity. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate the\npotential for PAPER to detect 21cm reionization at an amplitude of 10 mK^2 near\nk~0.2h Mpc^-1 with 132 dipoles in 7 months of observing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 21:13:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 23:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The main feature of this new\napproach is that each unit is treated as a whole body, which drastically\nreduces the search space and improves the efficiency, but necessitates the\nintroduction of new variation operators described here. To increase diversity\nof the population of structures, the initial population and\npart($\\scriptsize{\\sim}$20%) of the new generations are generated using space\ngroup symmetry combined with random cell parameters and random positions and\norientations of molecular units. We illustrate the efficiency and reliability\nof this approach by number of tests (ice, ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane,\nbenzene, glycine and butane-1,4-diammonium dibromide). This approach easily\npredicts the crystal structure of methane \\emph{A} containing 21 methane\nmolecules (105 atoms) per unit cell.

As GM is\ninhomogeneous and hence non-stationary, the squangles are expected to perform\nwell compared to standard approaches when there are changes in base-composition\namongst species.

Perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can be\nproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. It is known that central\nperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generally\ndistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern around\ncaustics. In this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for which\nit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. The\npeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be blunt\nand flat. For a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the source\ntrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of an\narrowhead-shaped central caustic. For a binary case, a similar perturbation\noccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation region\nbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. We demonstrate the degeneracy\nfor 2 high-magnification events of OGLE-2011-BLG-0526 and\nOGLE-2011-BLG-0950/MOA-2011-BLG-336. For OGLE-2011-BLG-0526, the $\\chi^2$\ndifference between the planetary and binary model is $\\sim$ 3, implying that\nthe degeneracy is very severe. For OGLE-2011-BLG-0950/MOA-2011-BLG-336, the\nstellar binary model is formally excluded with $\\Delta \\chi^2 \\sim$ 105 and the\nplanetary model is preferred. However, it is difficult to claim a planet\ndiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model are\nlarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. Considering\nthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, it\nis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy is\ncommon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2012 08:30:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 06:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Superconductivity and Bose-Einstein\ncondensation are examples of such cooperative phenomena where macroscopic order\nappears spontaneously. Here, we demonstrate that such an ordered state can also\nbe obtained in an optically excited semiconductor quantum well in a high\nmagnetic field. When we create a dense electron-hole plasma with an intense\nlaser pulse, after a certain delay, an ultrashort burst of coherent radiation\nemerges. We interpret this striking phenomenon as a manifestation of\nsuperfluorescence (SF), in which a macroscopic polarization spontaneously\nbuilds up from an initially incoherent ensemble of excited quantum oscillators\nand then decays abruptly producing giant pulses of coherent radiation. SF has\nbeen observed in atomic gases, but the present work represents the first\nobservation of SF in a solid-state setting. While there is an analogy between\nthe recombination of electron-hole pairs and radiative transitions in atoms,\nthere is no a priori reason for SF in semiconductors to be similar to atomic\nSF. This is a complex many-body system with a variety of ultrafast\ninteractions, where the decoherence rates are at least 1,000 times faster than\nthe radiative decay rate, an unusual situation totally unexplored in previous\natomic SF studies. We show, nonetheless, that collective many-body coupling via\na common radiation field does develop under certain conditions and leads to SF\nbursts. The solid-state realization of SF resulted in an unprecedented degree\nof controllability in the generation of SF, opening up opportunities for both\nfundamental many-body studies and device applications. We demonstrate that the\nintensity and delay time of SF bursts are fully tunable through an external\nmagnetic field, temperature, and pump laser power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2012 14:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-28"}

The third component of entropy production is\nassociated with the relaxation of the system probability distribution towards a\nstationary state and with nonequilibrium constraints within the dynamics that\nbreak detailed balance. It exists when at least some of the coordinates of the\nsystem phase space change sign under time reversal, and when the stationary\nstate is asymmetric in these coordinates. We illustrate the various components\nof entropy production, both in detail for particular trajectories and in the\nmean, using simple systems defined on a discrete phase space of spatial and\nvelocity coordinates. These models capture features of the drift and diffusion\nof a particle in a physical system, including the processes of injection and\nremoval and the effect of a temperature gradient.
