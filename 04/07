Our relaxed\npartition bound subsumes all norm based methods (e.g. the factorization norm\nmethod) and rectangle-based methods (e.g. the rectangle/corruption bound, the\nsmooth rectangle bound, and the discrepancy bound), except the partition bound.\nOur result uses a new connection between rectangles and zero-communication\nprotocols where the players can either output a value or abort. We prove the\nfollowing compression lemma: given a protocol for a function f with information\ncomplexity I, one can construct a zero-communication protocol that has\nnon-abort probability at least 2^{-O(I)} and that computes f correctly with\nhigh probability conditioned on not aborting. Then, we show how such a\nzero-communication protocol relates to the relaxed partition bound. We use our\nmain theorem to resolve three of the open questions raised by Braverman. First,\nwe show that the information complexity of the Vector in Subspace Problem is\n{\\Omega}(n^{1/3}), which, in turn, implies that there exists an exponential\nseparation between quantum communication complexity and classical information\ncomplexity.

However, our motivation\nis to maximize the sparsity of the Jacobian matrices, since this directly\ntranslates into higher performance in particular for implicit solvers, while\nmaintaining many of the good properties of the DG scheme. To achieve this, our\nscheme is based on applying one-dimensional DG solvers along each coordinate\ndirection in a reference element. This reduces the number of connectivities\ndrastically, since the scheme only connects each node to a line of nodes along\neach direction, as opposed to the standard DG method which connects all nodes\ninside the element and many nodes in the neighboring ones. The resulting scheme\nis similar to a collocation scheme, but it uses fully consistent integration\nalong each 1-D coordinate direction which results in different properties for\nnonlinear problems and curved elements. Also, the scheme uses solution points\nalong each element face, which further reduces the number of connections with\nthe neighboring elements. Second-order terms are handled by an LDG-type\napproach, with an upwind/downwind flux function based on a switch function at\neach element face. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method and compare it to\nthe standard nodal DG method for problems including Poisson's equation, Euler's\nequations of gas dynamics, and both the steady-state and the transient\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 18:47:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 22:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We combine photometry from 2MASS J, H, and Ks bands\nand Spitzer IRAC and MIPS 24 micron bands to create 1 - 24 micron spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs). Using protostars from the c2d survey with\nwell-determined bolometric luminosities (Lbol), we derive a relationship\nbetween Lbol, L_MIR (integrated from 1 - 24 microns), and SED slope.\nEstimations of Lbol for protostar candidates are combined to create luminosity\nfunctions for each cloud. Contamination due to edge-on disks, reddened Class II\nsources, and galaxies is estimated and removed from the luminosity functions.\nWe find that luminosity functions for high mass star forming clouds peak near 1\nLsun and show a tail extending toward luminosities above 100 Lsun. The\nluminosity functions of the low mass star forming clouds do not exhibit a\ncommon peak, however the combined luminosity function of these regions peaks\nbelow 1 Lsun. Finally, we examine the luminosity functions as a function of the\nlocal surface density of YSOs. In the Orion molecular cloud, we find a\nsignificant difference between the luminosity functions of protostars in\nregions of high and low stellar density, the former of which is biased toward\nmore luminous sources. This may be the result of primordial mass segregation,\nalthough this interpretation is not unique. We compare our luminosity functions\nto those predicted by models and find that our observed luminosity functions\nare best matched by models which invoke competitive accretion, although we do\nnot find strong agreement of the high mass star forming clouds with any of the\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 18:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We\nfind that a silicate surface on an exoplanet is spectroscopically detectable\nvia prominent Si-O features in the thermal emission bands of 7 - 13 \\mu m and\n15 - 25 \\mu m. The variation of brightness temperature due to the silicate\nfeatures can be up to 20 K for an airless Earth analog, and the silicate\nfeatures are wide enough to be distinguished from atmospheric features with\nrelatively high-resolution spectra. The surface characterization thus provides\na method to unambiguously identify a rocky exoplanet. Furthermore,\nidentification of specific rocky surface types is possible with the planet's\nreflectance spectrum in near-infrared broad bands. A key parameter to observe\nis the difference between K band and J band geometric albedos (A_g (K)-A_g\n(J)): A_g (K)-A_g (J) > 0.2 indicates that more than half of the planet's\nsurface has abundant mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene, in other\nwords primary crust from a magma ocean or high-temperature lavas; A_g (K)-A_g\n(J) < -0.09 indicates that more than half of the planet's surface is covered or\npartially covered by water ice or hydrated silicates, implying extant or past\nwater on its surface. Also, surface water ice can be specifically distinguished\nby an H-band geometric albedo lower than the J-band geometric albedo. The\nsurface features can be distinguished from possible atmospheric features with\nmolecule identification of atmospheric species by transmission spectroscopy. We\ntherefore propose that mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky\nsurfaces, and near-infrared spectrophotometry may identify ultramafic surfaces,\nhydrated surfaces and water ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 19:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

As scatters in measured cluster\nmasses are often sourced by properties of or around the clusters themselves,\ncorrelations between mass scatters are frequent and can be significant, with\nconsequences for errors on mass estimates obtained both directly and via\nstacking. Using a high resolution 250 Mpc/h side N-body simulation, combined\nwith proxies for observational cluster mass measurements, we obtain mass\nscatter correlations and covariances for 243 individual clusters along ~96\nlines of sight each, both separately and together. Many of these scatters are\nquite large and highly correlated. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to\ncharacterize scatter trends and variations between clusters. PCA identifies\ncombinations of scatters, or variations more generally, which are uncorrelated\nor non-covariant. The PCA combination of mass measurement techniques which\ndominates the mass scatter is similar for many clusters, and this combination\nis often present in a large amount when viewing the cluster along its long\naxis. We also correlate cluster mass scatter, environmental and intrinsic\nproperties, and use PCA to find shared trends between these. For example, if\nthe average measured richness, velocity dispersion and Compton decrement mass\nfor a cluster along many lines of sight are high relative to its true mass, in\nour simulation the cluster's mass measurement scatters around this average are\nalso high, its sphericity is high, and its triaxiality is low.\n  Our analysis is based upon estimated mass distributions for fixed true mass.\nExtensions to observational data would require further calibration from\nnumerical simulations, tuned to specific observational survey selection\nfunctions and systematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2012 22:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 04:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The optical\nspectrum exhibits broad emission features of [O I], [O II], [O III], H-alpha,\nH-beta, and [Fe II]. The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening\nof the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by\nincreasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha\nluminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant\nprogenitor at least ~1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit\nasymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of\nthe SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a\ncomplete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected\nwavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for\n[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core\ndust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool\ndense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could\nexplain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models\npredict. The [O I] line exhibits double-peaked structure on top of the broader\nunderlying profile, possibly due to emission from individual clumps of ejecta\nor ring-like structures of metal-rich debris.

However, an archival spectrum obtained\non day 1093 exhibits a third, redshifted peak, which we suspect has become\nextinguished by dust that formed over the last decade.

Transmission of small recoil energy in scattering is a\ncharacteristic of long-range forces. The main advantage of the ultracold\nneutron technique lies in possibility of detecting recoil energy as small as\n$10^{-7}$ eV. Here are presented constraints on the interaction potential\nparameters: $U(r)=a r^{-1} e^{-r/\\lambda}$ for dark matter particles and\nneutrons, as well as on the density value of long-range dark matter on the\nEarth. The possible mechanism of accumulation of long-range dark matter on the\nEarth surface is considered and the factor of density increase on the Earth\nsurface is evaluated.

Stability\nin this context is predominantly core stability or one of its variants in which\neach deviation is by a group of players. There has been little focus in\nmatching theory on stability concepts such as Nash stability and individual\nstability in which the deviation is by a single player. Such stability concepts\nare suitable especially when trust for the other party is limited, complex\ncoordination is not feasible, or when only unmatched agents can be approached.\nFurthermore, weaker stability notions such as individual stability may in\nprinciple circumvent the negative existence and computational complexity\nresults in matching theory.

An EM algorithm is developed to estimate parameters of the Gaussian\nmixtures. The finite mixture is a flexible and powerful probabilistic modeling\ntool.

However, the application of finite mixtures to image\nsegmentation presents some difficulties; especially it's sensible to noise. In\nthis paper we propose a variant of this method which aims to resolve this\nproblem. Our approach proceeds by the characterization of pixels by two\nfeatures: the first one describes the intrinsic properties of the pixel and the\nsecond characterizes the neighborhood of pixel. Then the classification is made\non the base on adaptive distance which privileges the one or the other features\naccording to the spatial position of the pixel in the image. The obtained\nresults have shown a significant improvement of our approach compared to the\nstandard version of EM algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2012 13:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-10"}

There are two main purposes: in the first\nplace to verify the reliability of the metallicity estimates derived from the\nSDSS spectra; in the second place to see if the abundance trends found for the\nbrighter nearer stars studied previously also hold for this sample of fainter,\nmore distant stars. Methods: We used the UVES at the VLT to obtain\nhigh-resolution spectra of the programme stars. The abundances were determined\nby an automatic analysis with the MyGIsFOS code, with the exception of lithium,\nfor which the abundances were determined from the measured equivalent widths of\nthe Li I resonance doublet. Results: All candidates are confirmed to be EMP\nstars, with [Fe/H]<= -3.0. The chemical composition of the sample of stars is\nsimilar to that of brighter and nearer samples. We measured the lithium\nabundance for 12 stars and provide stringent upper limits for three other\nstars, for a fourth star the upper limit is not significant, owing to the low\nsignal-to noise ratio of the spectrum. The \"meltdown\" of the Spite plateau is\nconfirmed, but some of the lowest metallicity stars of the sample lie on the\nplateau. Conclusions: The concordance of the metallicities derived from\nhigh-resolution spectra and those estimated from the SDSS spectra suggests that\nthe latter may be used to study the metallicity distribution of the halo. The\nabundance pattern suggests that the halo was well mixed for all probed\nmetallicities and distances. The fact that at the lowest metallicities we find\nstars on the Spite plateau suggests that the meltdown depends on at least\nanother parameter, besides metallicity.

First, we describe a monolayer model that\nincludes a coupling between a compositional scalar field and a two-dimensional\nvectorial order-parameter. Such a coupling yields an effective two-dimensional\nmicroemulsion free-energy for the lipid monolayer, and its characteristic\nlength of compositional modulations can be considered as the origin of\nfinite-size domains in biological membranes. Next, we consider a coupled\nbilayer composed of two modulated monolayers, and discuss the static and\ndynamic properties of concentration fluctuations above the transition\ntemperature. We also investigate the micro-phase separation below the\ntransition temperature, and compare the micro-phase separated structures with\nstatics and dynamics of concentration fluctuations above the transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2012 05:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

They provide the capabilities of\ncentralized repository for storage, management, networking and dissemination of\ndata. With the rapid increase in the capacity and size of data centers, there\nis a continuous increase in the demand for energy consumption. These data\ncenters not only consume a tremendous amount of energy but are riddled with IT\ninefficiencies. Data center are plagued with thousands of servers as major\ncomponents. These servers consume huge energy without performing useful work.\nIn an average server environment, 30% of the servers are \"dead\" only consuming\nenergy, without being properly utilized. This paper proposes a five step model\nusing an emerging technology called virtualization to achieve energy efficient\ndata centers. The proposed model helps Data Center managers to properly\nimplement virtualization technology in their data centers to make them green\nand energy efficient so as to ensure that IT infrastructure contributes as\nlittle as possible to the emission of greenhouse gases, and helps to regain\npower and cooling capacity, recapture resilience and dramatically reducing\nenergy costs and total cost of ownership.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2012 05:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-06"}

Opinion mining holder recognition is a task that has not been\nconsidered yet in Arabic Language. This task essentially requires deep\nunderstanding of clauses structures. Unfortunately, the lack of a robust,\npublicly available, Arabic parser further complicates the research. This paper\npresents a leading research for the opinion holder extraction in Arabic news\nindependent from any lexical parsers. We investigate constructing a\ncomprehensive feature set to compensate the lack of parsing structural\noutcomes. The proposed feature set is tuned from English previous works coupled\nwith our proposed semantic field and named entities features. Our feature\nanalysis is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and semi-supervised\npattern recognition techniques. Different research models are evaluated via\ncross-validation experiments achieving 54.03 F-measure.
