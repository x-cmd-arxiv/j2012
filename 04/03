The\nnegative permeability slab serves to focus the flux generated in the source\ncoil to the receiver coil, thereby increasing the mutual inductive coupling\nbetween the coils. The numerical model is compared with an analytical theory\nthat treats the coils as point dipoles separated by an infinite planar layer of\nmagnetic material [Urzhumov et al., Phys. Rev. B, 19, 8312 (2011)]. In the\nlimit of vanishingly small radius of the coils, and large width of the\nmetamaterial slab, the numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with\nthe analytical model. Both the idealized analytical and realistic numerical\nmodels predict similar trends with respect to metamaterial loss and anisotropy.\nApplying the numerical models, we further analyze the impact of finite coil\nsize and finite width of the slab. We find that, even for these less idealized\ngeometries, the presence of the magnetic slab greatly enhances the coupling\nbetween the two coils, including cases where significant loss is present in the\nslab. We therefore conclude that the integration of a metamaterial slab into a\nwireless power transfer system holds promise for increasing the overall system\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 19:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

Additional supporting evidence involving\nearlier analyses of cosmic rays is summarized to add credence to the tachyonic\nneutrino hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 18:12:26 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 15:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 23:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 May 2012 15:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 May 2012 20:17:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2012 16:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 2 Jul 2012 18:59:42 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 6 Jul 2012 12:32:05 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2012 15:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2012 12:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We employ a\nfinite-temperature nuclear equation of state, parameterized electron capture in\nthe collapse phase, and a multi-species neutrino leakage scheme after bounce.\nThe latter captures the important effects of deleptonization, neutrino cooling\nand heating and enables approximate predictions for the neutrino luminosities\nin the early evolution after core bounce.

We demonstrate, that the GW signal of\nrapidly rotating core collapse is practically independent of progenitor mass\nand precollapse structure. Moreover, we show that the effects of neutrino\nleakage on the GW signal are strong only in nonrotating or slowly rotating\nmodels in which GW emission is not dominated by inner core dynamics. In rapidly\nrotating cores, core bounce of the centrifugally-deformed inner core excites\nthe fundamental quadrupole pulsation mode of the nascent protoneutron star. The\nensuing global oscillations (f~700-800 Hz) lead to pronounced oscillations in\nthe GW signal and correlated strong variations in the rising luminosities of\nantineutrino and heavy-lepton neutrinos.

This LP decoder can be used to decode error-correcting\ncodes at bit-error-rates comparable to state-of-the-art belief propagation (BP)\ndecoders, but with significantly stronger theoretical guarantees. However, LP\ndecoding when implemented with standard LP solvers does not easily scale to the\nblock lengths of modern error correcting codes. In this paper we draw on\ndecomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the Alternating\nDirections Method of Multipliers (ADMM), to develop efficient distributed\nalgorithms for LP decoding.\n  The key enabling technical result is a \"two-slice\" characterization of the\ngeometry of the parity polytope, which is the convex hull of all codewords of a\nsingle parity check code. This new characterization simplifies the\nrepresentation of points in the polytope. Using this simplification, we develop\nan efficient algorithm for Euclidean norm projection onto the parity polytope.\nThis projection is required by ADMM and allows us to use LP decoding, with all\nits theoretical guarantees, to decode large-scale error correcting codes\nefficiently.\n  We present numerical results for LDPC codes of lengths more than 1000. The\nwaterfall region of LP decoding is seen to initiate at a slightly higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio than for sum-product BP, however an error floor is not\nobserved for LP decoding, which is not the case for BP. Our implementation of\nLP decoding using ADMM executes as fast as our baseline sum-product BP decoder,\nis fully parallelizable, and can be seen to implement a type of message-passing\nwith a particularly simple schedule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 23:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2013 17:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-24"}

We shall focus our attention on the compressible Euler equations in\none space dimension. The novel feature of our approach involves the coupling of\na linear scalar reaction-diffusion equation to our system of conservation laws,\nwhose solution $C(x,t)$ is the coefficient to an additional (and artificial)\nterm added to the flux, which determines the location, localization, and\nstrength of the artificial viscosity. Near shock discontinuities, $C(x,t)$ is\nlarge and localized, and transitions smoothly in space-time to zero away from\ndiscontinuities. Our approach is a provably convergent, spacetime-regularized\nvariant of the original idea of Richtmeyer and Von Neumann, and is provided at\nthe level of the PDE, thus allowing a host of numerical discretization schemes\nto be employed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the $C$-method with three\ndifferent numerical implementations and apply these to a collection of\nclassical problems: the Sod shock-tube, the Osher-Shu shock-tube, the\nWoodward-Colella blast wave and the Leblanc shock-tube. First, we use a\nclassical continuous finite-element implementation using second-order\ndiscretization in both space and time, FEM-C.

Its lightcurves in both the prompt and afterglow phases are\nsimilar to GRB 060614, a nearby long GRB without an associated SN. We analyze\nthe observational data of this event and discuss the possible origins of its\nmulti-wavelength emission. We show that its joint lightcurve at 1 keV derived\nfrom Swift BAT and XRT observations is composed of two distinguished\ncomponents. The first component, whose spectrum is extremely soft (\\Gamma =\n4.32), ends with a steep decay segment, indicating the internal origin of this\ncomponent. The second component is a slowly-rising, broad bump which peaks at\n~10^5 seconds post the BAT trigger. Assuming that the late bump is due to onset\nof the afterglow, we derive the initial Lorentz factor (Gamma_0) of the GRB\nfireball and find that it significantly deviates from the relation between the\nGamma_0 and Eiso of typical GRBs. We also check whether it follows the same\nanti-correlation between X-ray luminosity and the break time observed in the\nshallow decay phase of many typical GRBs, which is usually regarded as a signal\nof late energy injection from the GRB central engine. However, we find that it\ndoes not obey this correlation. We propose that the late bump could be\ncontributed by a two-component jet. We fit the second component with an\noff-axis jet model for a constant medium density and find the late bump can be\nrepresented by the model. The derived jet half-opening angle is 0.30 rad and\nthe viewing angle is 0.315 rad. The medium density is 0.05 cm^-3, possibly\nsuggesting that it may be from a merger of compact stars. The similarity\nbetween GRBs 060614 and 100418A may indicate that the two GRBs are from the\nsame population and the late bump observed in the two GRBs may be a signal of a\ntwo-component jet powered by the GRB central engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 02:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A domination parameter of $G$ is related to those structures\nof a graph satisfying some domination property together with other conditions\non the vertices of $G$. In this article we study several mathematical\nproperties related to coloring, domination and location of corona graphs.\n  We investigate the distance-$k$ colorings of corona graphs. Particularly, we\nobtain tight bounds for the distance-2 chromatic number and distance-3\nchromatic number of corona graphs, throughout some relationships between the\ndistance-$k$ chromatic number of corona graphs and the distance-$k$ chromatic\nnumber of its factors. Moreover, we give the exact value of the distance-$k$\nchromatic number of the corona of a path and an arbitrary graph. On the other\nhand, we obtain bounds for the Roman dominating number and the\nlocating-domination number of corona graphs. We give closed formulaes for the\n$k$-domination number, the distance-$k$ domination number, the independence\ndomination number, the domatic number and the idomatic number of corona graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2012 10:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-04"}

This technology is already planned to be exploited by future missions\ndedicated to spectroscopy and imaging at energies >10 keV, e.g. Astro-H and\nNuSTAR. Nevertheless, our understanding of the hard X-ray sky would greatly\nbenefit from carrying out contemporaneous polarimetric measurements, because\nthe study of hard spectral tails and of polarized emission often are two\ncomplementary diagnostics of the same non-thermal and acceleration processes.\nAt energies above a few tens of keV, the preferred technique to detect\npolarization involves the determination of photon directions after a Compton\nscattering. Many authors have asserted that stacked detectors with imaging\ncapabilities can be exploited for this purpose. If it is possible to\ndiscriminate those events which initially interact in the first detector by\nCompton scattering and are subsequently absorbed by the second layer, the\ndirection of scattering is singled out from the hit pixels in the two\ndetectors.

This new theory, \"shape dynamics\", is equivalent\nto general relativity but differs in an important respect: shape dynamics is a\ntheory of dynamic conformal 3-geometry, not a theory of spacetime. Equivalence\nis achieved by trading foliation invariance for local conformal invariance (up\nto a global scale). After the trading, what is left is a gauge theory invariant\nunder 3d diffeomorphisms and conformal transformations that preserve the volume\nof space. The local canonical constraints are linear and the constraint algebra\ncloses with structure constants. Shape dynamics, thus, provides a novel new\nstarting point for quantum gravity.\n  The procedure for the trading of symmetries was inspired by a technique\ncalled \"best matching\". We explain best matching and its relation to Mach's\nprinciples. The key features of best matching are illustrated through finite\ndimensional toy models. A general picture is then established where relational\ntheories are treated as gauge theories on configuration space. Shape dynamics\nis then constructed by applying best matching to conformal geometry. We then\nstudy shape dynamics in more detail by computing its Hamiltonian and\nHamilton-Jacobi functional perturbatively.\n  This thesis is intended as a pedagogical but complete introduction to shape\ndynamics and the Machian ideas that led to its discovery.
