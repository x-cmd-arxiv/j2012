An inevitable source of\ncorrelation in finite neural networks is common presynaptic input to pairs of\nneurons. Recent theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that spike\ncorrelations in recurrent neural networks are considerably smaller than\nexpected based on the amount of shared presynaptic input. By means of a linear\nnetwork model and simulations of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons,\nwe show that shared-input correlations are efficiently suppressed by inhibitory\nfeedback. To elucidate the effect of feedback, we compare the responses of the\nintact recurrent network and systems where the statistics of the feedback\nchannel is perturbed. The suppression of spike-train correlations and\npopulation-rate fluctuations by inhibitory feedback can be observed both in\npurely inhibitory and in excitatory-inhibitory networks. The effect is fully\nunderstood by a linear theory and becomes already apparent at the macroscopic\nlevel of the population averaged activity. At the microscopic level,\nshared-input correlations are suppressed by spike-train correlations: In purely\ninhibitory networks, they are canceled by negative spike-train correlations. In\nexcitatory-inhibitory networks, spike-train correlations are typically\npositive. Here, the suppression of input correlations is not a result of the\nmere existence of correlations between excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I)\nneurons, but a consequence of a particular structure of correlations among the\nthree possible pairings (EE, EI, II).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 16:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 May 2012 14:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We provide an exhaustive study of the challenges and open problems\nlinked to the truncation of such hierarchy of equations to make them\npractically applicable. We restrict our analysis to the coupled evolution of\nthe one- and two-body reduced density matrices, where higher order correlation\neffects are embodied into the approximation used to close the equations. We\nprove that within this approach, the number of electrons and total energy are\nconserved, regardless of the employed approximation. Further, we demonstrate\nthat although most of the truncation schemes available in the literature give\nacceptable ground state energy, when applied to describe driven electron\ndynamics exhibit undesirable and unphysical behavior, e.g., violation and even\ndivergence in local electronic density, both in weakly- and strongly-correlated\nregimes. We illustrate and analyze these problems within the few-site Hubbard\nmodel. The model can be solved exactly and provides a unique reference for our\ndetailed study of electron dynamics for different values of interaction,\ndifferent initial conditions, and large set of approximations considered here.\nMoreover, we study the role of compatibility between two hierarchical\nequations, and positive- semidefiniteness of reduced density matrices in\ninstability of electron dynamics. We show that even if the used approximation\nholds the compatibility, electron dynamics can still diverge when positive-\ndefinitiveness is violated. We propose some partial solutions of such problem\nand point the main paths for future work in order to make this approach\napplicable for the description of the correlated electron dynamics in complex\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 16:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-26"}

This unintuitive behavior is attributed to increasing\nquasi-one dimensional field-induced confinement and the resulting suppression\nof the back-scattering.

Hoover's comment [arXiv:1204.0312v2] on our work\n[arXiv:1203.5968], we show explicitly that the divergence of the velocity field\nassociated with the Nos\\'e-Hoover equations is nonzero, implying that those\nequations are not volume preserving, and hence, as often stated in the\nliterature, are not Hamiltonian. We further elucidate that the trajectories\n{q(t)} generated by the Nos\\'e-Hoover equations are generally not identical to\nthose generated by Dettmann's Hamiltonian. Dettmann's Hamiltonian produces the\nsame trajectories as the Nos\\'e-Hoover equations only on a specific energy\nshell, but not on the neighboring ones. This fact explains why the\nNos\\'e-Hoover equations are not volume preserving. The Hamiltonian that we put\nforward with [arXiv:1203.5968] instead produces thermostated dynamics\nirrespective of the energy value. The main advantage of our Hamiltonian\nthermostat over previous ones is that it contains kinetic energy terms that are\nof standard form with coordinate-independent masses and consequently is readily\nmatched in laboratory experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 17:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-20"}

The injection region is the set\nof all vectors of bus power injections that satisfy the network and operation\nconstraints. The geometrical object of interest is the set of Pareto-optimal\npoints of the injection region. If the voltage magnitudes are fixed, the\ninjection region of a tree network can be written as a linear transformation of\nthe product of two-bus injection regions, one for each line in the network.\nUsing this decomposition, we show that under the practical condition that the\nangle difference across each line is not too large, the set of Pareto-optimal\npoints of the injection region remains unchanged by taking the convex hull.\nMoreover, the resulting convexified optimal power flow problem can be\nefficiently solved via }{ semi-definite programming or second order cone\nrelaxations. These results improve upon earlier works by removing the\nassumptions on active power lower bounds. It is also shown that our practical\nangle assumption guarantees two other properties: (i) the uniqueness of the\nsolution of the power flow problem, and (ii) the non-negativity of the\nlocational marginal prices.

All of these solutions present considerable difficulties, however, so\nthe faint young Sun problem cannot be regarded as solved. Here I review\nresearch on the subject, including the latest suggestions for solutions of the\nfaint young Sun problem and recent geochemical constraints on the composition\nof Earth's early atmosphere. Furthermore, I will outline the most promising\ndirections for future research. In particular I would argue that both improved\ngeochemical constraints on the state of the Archean climate system and\nnumerical experiments with state-of-the-art climate models are required to\nfinally assess what kept the oceans on the Archean Earth from freezing over\ncompletely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-28"}

In such applications, it is important to support\nend-to-end delay constraints for packet deliveries even when the corresponding\nflows require multi-hop transmissions. In addition to delay constraints, each\nflow of real-time surveillance may require some guarantees on throughput of\npackets that meet the delay constraints. Further, as wireless sensor networks\nare usually deployed in challenging environments, it is important to\nspecifically consider the effects of unreliable wireless transmissions.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of providing end-to-end delay guarantees\nfor multi-hop wireless networks. We propose a model that jointly considers the\nend-to-end delay constraints and throughput requirements of flows, the need for\nmulti-hop transmissions, and the unreliable nature of wireless transmissions.\nWe develop a framework for designing feasibility-optimal policies. We then\ndemonstrate the utility of this framework by considering two types of systems:\none where sensors are equipped with full-duplex radios, and the other where\nsensors are equipped with half-duplex radios. When sensors are equipped with\nfull-duplex radios, we propose an online distributed scheduling policy and\nproves the policy is feasibility-optimal. We also provide a heuristic for\nsystems where sensors are equipped with half-duplex radios. We show that this\nheuristic is still feasibility-optimal for some topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 20:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-23"}

A large region of the\nprobability density function (pdf) for Delta theta is found to follow an\nexponential decay, proportional to exp(-Delta theta/theta_*), with\ncharacteristic angle theta_* ~ (14 deg) (b_rms/B_0)^0.65 for a broad range of\nguide-field strengths. We find that discontinuities observed in the solar wind\ncan be reproduced by MHD turbulence with reasonable ratios of b_rms/B_0. We\nalso observe an excess of small angular discontinuities when Delta x becomes\nsmall, possibly indicating an increasing statistical significance of\ndissipation-scale structures. The structure of the pdf in this case closely\nresembles the two-population pdf seen in the solar wind. We thus propose that\nstrong discontinuities are associated with inertial-range MHD turbulence, while\nweak discontinuities emerge from near-dissipation-range turbulence.

Many methods to separate the\ntwo populations are used in the literature, based on X-ray and multiwavelength\nproperties. We aim at a detailed test of the classification schemes and to\nstudy the X-ray properties of the resulting samples. We build on a sample of\ngalaxies selected at 1.4 GHz in the VLA-COSMOS survey, classified by Smolcic et\nal. (2008) according to their optical colours and observed with Chandra. A\nsimilarly selected control sample of AGN is also used for comparison. We review\nsome X-ray based classification criteria and check how they affect the sample\ncomposition. The efficiency of the classification scheme devised by Smolcic et\nal. (2008) is such that ~30% of composite/misclassified objects are expected\nbecause of the higher X-ray brightness of AGN with respect to galaxies. The\nlatter fraction is actually 50% in the X-ray detected sources, while it is\nexpected to be much lower among X-ray undetected sources. Indeed, the analysis\nof the stacked spectrum of undetected sources shows, consistently, strongly\ndifferent properties between the AGN and galaxy samples. X-ray based selection\ncriteria are then used to refine both samples. The radio/X-ray luminosity\ncorrelation for star forming galaxies is found to hold with the same\nX-ray/radio ratio valid for nearby galaxies. Some evolution of the ratio may be\npossible for sources at high redshift or high luminosity, tough it is likely\nexplained by a bias arising from the radio selection. Finally, we discuss the\nX-ray number counts of star forming galaxies from the VLA- and C-COSMOS surveys\naccording to different selection criteria, and compare them to the similar\ndetermination from the Chandra Deep Fields. The classification scheme proposed\nhere may find application in future works and surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 22:28:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 13:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 16:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-28"}

We consider p$\\gamma$ and $pp$ interactions. For the\np$\\gamma$ interaction, we assume that the target photons are those produced at\n150 keV in the leptonic processes. On the other hand, for the pp interaction we\nconsider as targets the thermal particle densities in the lobes. Requiring a\nsatisfactory description of the spectra at very high energies with p$\\gamma$\ninteraction we obtain an excessive luminosity in ultra high energy cosmic rays\n(even exceeding the Eddington luminosity). However, when considering pp\ninteraction to describe the $\\gamma$-spectrum, the obtained number of ultra\nhigh energy cosmic rays are in agreement with Pierre Auger observations.\nMoreover, we calculate the possible neutrino signal from pp interactions on a\nKm$^3 $ neutrino telescope using Monte Carlo simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 23:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This leads to the fact that scalar radiation is emitted\nfrom a binary containing at least one BH. In this letter, we find the\nconstraints on this theory from BH low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs). The main\nresult of this letter is that from the orbital decay rate of A0620-00, we\nobtained a conservative bound that is six orders of magnitude stronger than the\nsolar system bound. In addition to this, we look at XTE J1118+480, whose\norbital decay rate has been recently measured with an excess compared to the\ntheoretical prediction in GR due to the radiation reaction. The cause of this\nexcess is currently unknown. Although it is likely that the cause is of\nastrophysical origin, here we investigate the possibility of explaining this\nexcess with the additional scalar radiation in sGB theory. We find that there\nstill remains a parameter range where the excess can be explained while also\nsatisfying the constraint obtained from A0620-00. The interesting point is that\nfor most of other alternative theories of gravity, it seems difficult to\nexplain this excess with the additional radiation. This is because it would be\ndifficult to evade the constraints from binary pulsars or they have already\nbeen constrained rather strongly from other observations such as solar system\nexperiments. We propose several ways to determine whether the excess is caused\nby the scalar radiation in sGB gravity including future gravitational wave\nobservations with space-borne interferometers, which can give a constraint\nthree orders of magnitude stronger than that from A0620-00.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 03:35:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2013 05:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-08"}

Compared to the\ncontinuous greedy algorithm (Calinescu, Chekuri, Pal and Vondrak, 2008), our\nalgorithm is extremely simple and requires no rounding. It consists of the\ngreedy algorithm followed by local search. Both phases are run not on the\nactual objective function, but on a related non-oblivious potential function,\nwhich is also monotone submodular. Our algorithm runs in randomized time\nO(n^8u), where n is the rank of the given matroid and u is the size of its\nground set. We additionally obtain a 1-1/e-eps approximation algorithm running\nin randomized time O (eps^-3n^4u). For matroids in which n = o(u), this\nimproves on the runtime of the continuous greedy algorithm. The improvement is\ndue primarily to the time required by the pipage rounding phase, which we avoid\naltogether. Furthermore, the independence of our algorithm from pipage rounding\ntechniques suggests that our general approach may be helpful in contexts such\nas monotone submodular maximization subject to multiple matroid constraints.\n  Our approach generalizes to the case where the monotone submodular function\nhas restricted curvature. For any curvature c, we adapt our algorithm to\nproduce a (1-e^-c)/c approximation. This result complements results of Vondrak\n(2008), who has shown that the continuous greedy algorithm produces a\n(1-e^-c)/c approximation when the objective function has curvature c.

There are two contrasting approaches to model\ninformation diffusion: a push type model known as Independent Cascade (IC)\nmodel and a pull type model known as Linear Threshold (LT) model. We extend\nthese two models (called AsIC and AsLT in this paper) to incorporate\nasynchronous time delay and investigate 1) how they differ from or similar to\neach other in terms of information diffusion, 2) whether the model itself is\nlearnable or not from the observed information diffusion data, and 3) which\nmodel is more appropriate to explain for a particular topic (information) to\ndiffuse/propagate. We first show there can be variations with respect to how\nthe time delay is modeled, and derive the likelihood of the observed data being\ngenerated for each model. Using one particular time delay model, we show the\nmodel parameters are learnable from a limited amount of observation.

We next apply these methods to behavioral analysis of topic\npropagation using the real blog propagation data, and show there is a clear\nindication as to which topic better follows which model although the results\nare rather insensitive to the model selected at the level of discussing how far\nand fast each topic propagates from the learned parameter values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 04:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-23"}

However, the amount of computation time required to perform\nUVCluster analyses imposed significant limitations to its use.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the suite Jerarca, designed to\nefficiently convert networks of interacting units into dendrograms by means of\niterative hierarchical clustering. Jerarca is divided into three main sections.\nFirst, weighted distances among units are computed using up to three different\napproaches: a more efficient version of UVCluster and two new, related\nalgorithms called RCluster and SCluster. Second, Jerarca builds dendrograms\nbased on those distances, using well-known phylogenetic algorithms, such as\nUPGMA or Neighbor-Joining. Finally, Jerarca provides optimal partitions of the\ntrees using statistical criteria based on the distribution of intra- and\nintercluster connections. Outputs compatible with the phylogenetic software\nMEGA and the Cytoscape package are generated, allowing the results to be easily\nvisualized.\n  Conclusions/Significance: The four main advantages of Jerarca in respect to\nUVCluster are: 1) Improved speed of a novel UVCluster algorithm; 2) Additional,\nalternative strategies to perform iterative hierarchical clustering; 3)\nAutomatic evaluation of the hierarchical trees to obtain optimal partitions;\nand, 4) Outputs compatible with popular software such as MEGA and Cytoscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 11:16:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 15:15:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 10:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-20"}

In this contribution we improve the robustness and\ncomputational complexity aspects of this algorithm. The method is based on\nprojection in Krylov subspaces to improve complexity and a new criterion called\nthe Partial Effective Rank (PER) to estimate the level of sparsity to gain\nrobustness.\n  If P antennas measure a K-multipath channel with N uniformly sampled\nmeasurements per channel, the algorithm possesses an O(KPNlogN) complexity and\nan O(KPN) memory footprint instead of O(PN^3) and O(PN^2) for the direct\nimplementation, making it suitable for K << N. The sparsity is estimated online\nbased on the PER, and the algorithm therefore has a sense of introspection\nbeing able to relinquish sparsity if it is lacking.

This is\nbroadly consistent with a geometry where for the hard state (low $\\Gamma \\sim\n1.7$) there is a hot inner Comptonizing region surrounded by a truncated cold\ndisk. The inner edge of the disk moves inwards as the source becomes softer\ntill finally in the soft state (high $\\Gamma > 2.2$) the disk fills the inner\nregion and active regions above the disk produce the Comptonized component.\nHowever, the reflection parameter shows non-monotonic behaviour near the\ntransition region ($\\Gamma \\sim 2$), suggestive of a more complex geometry or\nphysical state of the reflector. Additionally, the inner disk temperature,\nduring the hard state, is on the average higher than in the soft one, albeit\nwith large scatter. These inconsistencies could be due to limitations in the\ndata and the empirical model used to fit them. The flux of each spectral\ncomponent is well correlated with $\\Gamma$ which shows that unlike some other\nblack hole systems, Cyg X-1 does not show any hysteresis behaviour. In the soft\nstate, the flux of the Comptonized component is always similar to the disk one,\nwhich confirms that the ultra-soft state (seen in other brighter black hole\nsystems) is not exhibited by Cyg X-1. The rapid variation of the Compton\nAmplification factor with $\\Gamma$, naturally explains the absence of spectra\nwith $\\Gamma < 1.6$, despite a large number having $\\Gamma \\sim 1.65$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 13:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

There are 5 primary reasons for suggesting this:\n1. there are well known disc surface mass density distributions that naturally\nproduce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. 2. there are a number of\nrotation curve `puzzles' that cannot be explained by a massive dark matter halo\ni.e. the success of maximum disc fitting, HI gas scaling to the observed\nrotation, the disc/halo conspiracy and the interpretation of the Tully-Fisher\nrelation. 3. recent 21cm observations show an almost constant HI surface\ndensity and a distinct `cut-off' or edge to galactic discs. We explain this\nconstant surface density in terms of either an optical depth effect or the\nonset of molecular gas formation and hence the possibility of considerably more\ngas existing in galaxies. We suggest that the HI cut-off does indeed mark the\nedge of the galactic disc. 4. there have been an increasing number of recent\nobservations that imply that X_CO may be ten times higher in the outer Galaxy.\nThis `dark' gas may provide adequate mass to account for galaxy rotation. 5. we\nshow that the additional baryonic mass required to account for the rotation of\ngalaxies is just that required to reconcile observed baryons with those\npredicted by big bang nucleosynthesis. Mestel discs can be used to straight\nforwardly explain the scaling laws of galaxies, particularly the observed\nrelation between rotation velocity and radius and the oft used Tully-Fisher\nrelation. We discuss observations of the baryonic content of galactic discs and\nwhere sufficient `hidden' baryons might be found to account for the rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 14:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-23"}

The purpose of\nthis work is to propose an algorithm that automatically identifies a sparse set\nof locations on the patient's surface with the optimal prediction power for the\ntumor motion. The sparse selection of markers on the external surface and the\nassumed linear relationship between the marker motion and the internal tumor\nmotion are represented by a prediction matrix. Such a matrix is determined by\nsolving an optimization problem, where the objective function contains a\nsparsity term that penalizes the number of markers chosen on the patient's\nsurface. The performance of our algorithm has been tested on realistic clinical\ndata of four lung cancer patients. Thoracic 4DCT scans with 10 phases are used\nfor the study. On a reference phase, a grid of points are casted on the\npatient's surface (except for patient's back) and propagated to other phases\nvia deformable image registration of the corresponding CT images. Tumor\nlocations at each phase are also manually delineated. We use 9 out of 10 phases\nof the 4DCT images to identify a small group of surface markers that are most\ncorrelated with the motion of the tumor, and find the prediction matrix at the\nsame time. The 10th phase is then used to test the accuracy of the prediction.\nIt is found that on average 6 to 7 surface markers are necessary to predict\ntumor locations with a 3D error of about 1mm. In addition, the selected marker\nlocations lie closely in those areas where surface point motion has a high\ncorrelation with the tumor motion. Our method can automatically select sparse\nlocations on patient's external surface and estimate a correlation matrix based\non 4DCT, so that the selected surface locations can be used to place fiducial\nmarkers to optimally predict internal tumor motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 22:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In past studies, their prediction has been\nmainly tackled by explicitly deriving a discrete time model and then\nlinearizing it in the vicinity of the operating point. However, the results\nobtained from such an approach cannot be applied for design purpose.\nAlternatively, in this paper, the subharmonic oscillations in voltage mode\ncontrolled DC-DC buck converters are predicted by using a formal symbolic\napproach. This approach is based on expressing the subharmonic oscillation\nconditions in the frequency domain and then converting the results to\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions. The obtained expressions depend\nexplicitly on the system parameters and the operating duty cycle making the\nresults directly applicable for design purpose. Under certain practical\nconditions concerning these parameters, the hypergeometric functions can be\napproximated by polylogarithm and standard functions. The new approach is\ndemonstrated using an example of voltage-mode-controlled buck converters. It is\nfound that the stability of the converter is strongly dependent upon a\npolynomial function of the duty cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 19:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

Such models can also help detect possible\ndifferences between training and target distributions, which is useful in\napplications where concept drift may take place, as in transfer learning\nsettings. This paper describes a general optimization framework that takes as\ninput class membership estimates from existing classifiers learnt on previously\nencountered \"source\" data, as well as a similarity matrix from a cluster\nensemble operating solely on the target data to be classified, and yields a\nconsensus labeling of the target data. This framework admits a wide range of\nloss functions and classification/clustering methods. It exploits properties of\nBregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre duality to yield a principled\nand scalable approach. A variety of experiments show that the proposed\nframework can yield results substantially superior to those provided by popular\ntransductive learning techniques or by naively applying classifiers learnt on\nthe original task to the target data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 01:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-06"}
