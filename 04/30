As an alternative\nthat avoids the mathematical difficulties facing the approach of Jordan and\nPaul A. M. Dirac (1927), John von Neumann (1927a) developed the modern Hilbert\nspace formalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we focus on Jordan and von\nNeumann. Central to the formalisms of both are expressions for conditional\nprobabilities of finding some value for one quantity given the value of\nanother. Beyond that Jordan and von Neumann had very different views about the\nappropriate formulation of problems in quantum mechanics. For Jordan, unable to\nlet go of the analogy to classical mechanics, the solution of such problems\nrequired the identication of sets of canonically conjugate variables, i.e., p's\nand q's. For von Neumann, not constrained by the analogy to classical\nmechanics, it required only the identication of a maximal set of commuting\noperators with simultaneous eigenstates. He had no need for p's and q's. Jordan\nand von Neumann also stated the characteristic new rules for probabilities in\nquantum mechanics somewhat differently. Jordan (1927b) was the first to state\nthose rules in full generality. Von Neumann (1927a) rephrased them and, in a\nsubsequent paper (von Neumann, 1927b), sought to derive them from more basic\nconsiderations. In this paper we reconstruct the central arguments of these\n1927 papers by Jordan and von Neumann and of a paper on Jordan's approach by\nHilbert, von Neumann, and Nordheim (1928). We highlight those elements in these\npapers that bring out the gradual loosening of the ties between the new quantum\nformalism and classical mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2012 19:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 14:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Categorization becomes more useful as the collection of resources\nincreases. Large collections of books, movies, and web pages, for instance, are\ncataloged in libraries, organized in databases and classified in directories,\nrespectively. However, the usual largeness of these collections requires a vast\nendeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually.\n  Recent research is moving towards developing automated classifiers that\nreduce the increasing costs and effort of the task. Little work has been done\nanalyzing the appropriateness of and exploring how to harness the annotations\nprovided by users on social tagging systems as a data source. Users on these\nsystems save resources as bookmarks in a social environment by attaching\nannotations in the form of tags. It has been shown that these tags facilitate\nretrieval of resources not only for the annotators themselves but also for the\nwhole community. Likewise, these tags provide meaningful metadata that refers\nto the content of the resources.\n  In this thesis, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags in\nsearch of the most accurate classification of resources as compared to\nexpert-driven categorizations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nresearch work performing actual classification experiments utilizing social\ntags. By exploring the characteristics and nature of these systems and the\nunderlying folksonomies, this thesis sheds new light on the way of getting the\nmost out of social tags for the sake of automated resource classification\ntasks. Therefore, we believe that the contributions in this work are of utmost\ninterest for future researchers in the field, as well as for the scientific\ncommunity in order to better understand these systems and further utilize the\nknowledge garnered from social tags.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2012 21:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}

It is\nnatural to consider how to form a hierarchy based on SLUR. Such investigations\nwere started in [Cepek et al, 2012] and [Balyo et al, 2012]. We present what we\nconsider the \"limit hierarchy\" SLUR_k, based on generalising r_1 by r_k, that\nis, using generalised unit-clause-propagation introduced in [Kullmann, 1999,\n2004].\n  The class UC, studied in [Del Val, 1994], is the class of Unit refutation\nComplete clause-sets, that is, those clause-sets for which unsatisfiability is\ndecidable by r_1 under any falsifying assignment. For unsatisfiable clause-sets\nF, the minimum k such that r_k determines unsatisfiability of F is exactly the\n\"hardness\" of F, as introduced in [Ku 99, 04]. For satisfiable F we use now an\nextension mentioned in [Ansotegui et al, 2008]: The hardness is the minimum k\nsuch that after application of any falsifying partial assignments, r_k\ndetermines unsatisfiability. The class UC_k is given by the clause-sets which\nhave hardness <= k.

This line of\nresearch culminated recently in the breakthroughs of Conlon and Gowers and of\nSchacht, who developed general tools for solving problems of this type.\n  In this paper, we provide a third, completely different approach to proving\nextremal and structural results in sparse random sets. We give a structural\ncharacterization of the independent sets in a large class of uniform\nhypergraphs by showing that every independent set is almost contained in one of\na small number of relatively sparse sets. We then derive many interesting\nresults as fairly straightforward consequences of this abstract theorem.

Leveraging the ability of\n$\\ell_1$- and nuclear norms to recover sparse and low-rank matrices, a convex\nprogram is formulated to estimate the unknowns.

We have\ndistinguished the moss regions from the rest of the active region by defining a\nlow density cut-off as derived by Tripathi et al. (2010).

The mean of the distribution shows a\nblue shift which increases with increasing temperature and the distribution\nalso shows asymmetries towards blue-shift. Comparing these results with\nobservables predicted from different coronal heating models, we find that these\nresults are consistent with both steady and impulsive heating scenarios.\nHowever, the fact that there are a significant number of pixels showing\nvelocity amplitudes that exceed the uncertainty of 5 km s$^{-1}$ is suggestive\nof impulsive heating. Clearly, further observational constraints are needed to\ndistinguish between these two heating scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 04:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The proposed scheme is then\napplied to the case of four transmit antennas and we show that the new rate-1\nFGD code has the lowest worst-case decoding complexity among existing\ncomparable STBCs. The coding gain of the new rate-1 code is optimized through\nconstellation stretching and proved to be constant irrespective of the\nunderlying QAM constellation prior to normalization. Next, we propose a new\nrate-2 FD STBC by multiplexing two of our rate-1 codes by the means of a\nunitary matrix.

The\nloss function approach is applied to major learning algorithms such as support\nvector machine (SVM) and boosting methods. The loss function represents the\npenalty of the decision function on the training samples. In the learning\nalgorithm, the empirical mean of the loss function is minimized to obtain the\nclassifier. Against a backdrop of the development of mathematical programming,\nnowadays learning algorithms based on loss functions are widely applied to\nreal-world data analysis. In addition, statistical properties of such learning\nalgorithms are well-understood based on a lots of theoretical works. On the\nother hand, the learning method using the so-called uncertainty set is used in\nhard-margin SVM, mini-max probability machine (MPM) and maximum margin MPM. In\nthe learning algorithm, firstly, the uncertainty set is defined for each binary\nlabel based on the training samples. Then, the best separating hyperplane\nbetween the two uncertainty sets is employed as the decision function. This is\nregarded as an extension of the maximum-margin approach. The uncertainty set\napproach has been studied as an application of robust optimization in the field\nof mathematical programming. The statistical properties of learning algorithms\nwith uncertainty sets have not been intensively studied. In this paper, we\nconsider the relation between the above two approaches.

For\nevery $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$, we find a relatively small collection $C$ of\nvertex subsets, such that every independent set of $G$ is contained within a\nmember of $C$, and no member of $C$ is large; the collection, which is in\nvarious respects optimal, reveals an underlying structure to the independent\nsets. The containers offer a straightforward and unified approach to many\ncombinatorial questions concerned (usually implicitly) with independence.\n  With regard to colouring, it follows that simple $r$-uniform hypergraphs of\naverage degree $d$ have list chromatic number at least $(1/(r-1)^2 + o(1))\n\\log_r d$.

A simple model\nwas proposed by Simon, who assumed that firms grow at a rate proportional to\ntheir size, and that new divisions of firms with certain probabilities relocate\nto other firms or to new centres of economic activity. Simon's model produces\nrealistic results in the sense that the sizes of economic centres follow a Zipf\ndistribution, which is also observed in reality. It lacks realism in the sense\nthat mechanisms such as cluster formation, congestion (defined as an overly\nhigh density of the same activities) and dependence on the spatial distribution\nof external parties (clients, labour markets) are ignored.\n  The present paper proposed an extension of the Simon model that includes both\ncentripetal and centrifugal forces. Centripetal forces are included in the\nsense that firm divisions are more likely to settle in locations that offer a\nhigher accessibility to other firms. Centrifugal forces are represented by an\naversion of a too high density of activities in the potential location. The\nmodel is implemented as an agent-based simulation model in a simplified spatial\nsetting. By running both the Simon model and the extended model, comparisons\nare made with respect to their effects on spatial configurations. To this end a\nseries of metrics are used, including the rank-size distribution and indices of\nthe degree of clustering and concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 13:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}

The scheme's security against\nplaintext attack is also investigated by considering the information-theoretic\nindistinguishability of the encryption scheme. Finally, we make a conjecture\nregarding Breidbart's attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 15:08:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 11:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-28"}

However, the\nanalysis of multi-spacecraft in-ecliptic IMF measurements from 0.29 AU to 5 AU\nshows that the IMF radial evolution is rather far from expected. The radial IMF\ncomponent decreases with the adiabatic power index (|Br| \\sim r^-5/3), the\ntangential component |Bt| \\sim r^-1.1 and, the IMF strength B \\sim r^-1.4. This\nmeans that the IMF is not completely frozen in the solar wind. Possibly,\nturbulent processes in the inner heliosphere significantly influence the IMF\nexpansion. This means that the IMF is not completely frozen in the solar wind.\nIt is possible that turbulent processes in the inner heliosphere significantly\ninfluence the IMF expansion. This is confirmed by the analysis of the Br\ndistribution's radial evolution. We consider a quasi-continuous magnetic\nreconnection, occurring both at the heliospheric current sheet and at local\ncurrent sheets inside the IMF sectors, to be a key process responsible for the\nsolar wind turbulization with heliocentric distance as well as for the\nbreakdown of the frozen-in IMF law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 15:38:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 14:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-06"}

In this model a\ncommunication network is represented by a graph where vertices host processors,\nand communication is performed over the edges. Computation proceeds in\nsynchronous rounds. The running time of an algorithm is the number of rounds\nfrom the beginning until all vertices terminate. Local computation is free. An\nalgorithm is called {local} if it terminates within a constant number of\nrounds. The question of what problems can be computed locally was raised by\nNaor and Stockmayer \\cite{NS93} in their seminal paper in STOC'93. Since then\nthe quest for problems with local algorithms, and for problems that cannot be\ncomputed locally, has become a central research direction in the field of\ndistributed algorithms \\cite{KMW04,KMW10,LOW08,PR01}.\n  We devise the first local algorithm for an {NP-complete} problem.\nSpecifically, our randomized algorithm computes, with high probability, an\nO(n^{1/2 + epsilon} \\cdot chi)-coloring within O(1) rounds, where epsilon > 0\nis an arbitrarily small constant, and chi is the chromatic number of the input\ngraph. (This problem was shown to be NP-complete in \\cite{Z07}.) On our way to\nthis result we devise a constant-time algorithm for computing (O(1), O(n^{1/2 +\nepsilon}))-network-decompositions. Network-decompositions were introduced by\nAwerbuch et al. \\cite{AGLP89}, and are very useful for solving various\ndistributed problems.
