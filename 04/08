Information about the\ncontext in which the users communicate is a key piece of knowledge to design\nefficient routing protocols in opportunistic networks. But this kind of\ninformation is not always available. When users are very isolated, context\ninformation cannot be distributed, and cannot be used for taking efficient\nrouting decisions. In such cases, context oblivious based schemes are only way\nto enable communication between users. As soon as users become more social,\ncontext data spreads in the network, and context based routing becomes an\nefficient solution. In this paper we design an integrated routing protocol that\nis able to use context data as soon as it becomes available and falls back to\ndissemination based routing when context information is not available. Then, we\nprovide a comparison between Epidemic and PROPHET, these are representative of\ncontext oblivious and context aware routing protocols.

The ambiguity is associated with\nsingularities in the Borel plane on the positive real axis. In quantum\nmechanics there are cases in which the ambiguity that arises in perturbation\ntheory cancels against a similarly ambiguous contribution from\ninstanton--anti-instanton events. In asymptotically free gauge theories this\nmechanism does not suffice because perturbation theory develops ambiguities\nassociated with singularities in the Borel plane which are closer to the origin\nby a factor of about N (the rank of the gauge group) compared to the\nsingularities realized by instanton events. These are called IR renormalon\npoles, and on R**4 they do not possess any known semiclassical realization. By\nusing continuity on R**3 x S**1, and by generalizing the works of Bogomolny and\nZinn-Justin to QFT, we identify saddle point field configurations, e.g.,\nbion--anti-bion events, corresponding to singularities in the Borel plane which\nare of order N times closer to the origin than the 4d BPST\ninstanton--anti-instanton singularity. We conjecture that these are the leading\nsingularities in the Borel plane and that they are the incarnation of the\nelusive renormalons in the weak coupling regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Apr 2012 17:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}
