When the layer width $k\\ll n$, the large-deviation\nprobabilities are virtually independent of $k$. In the case of rods the\nprobabilities of large deviations exhibit similar exponential decay, but this\ntime it is distorted by $\\log n$ corrections. In the case of Kadanoff blocks of\nsize $k$ the large-deviation probabilities decay exponentially with $k^{d-2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 17:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-11"}

We apply the technique to recent Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) measurements of Luminous Red Galaxy lenses and typical (L*)\nsource galaxies with photometric redshifts selected from the SDSS imaging data.\nCompared to previous measurements, this method has the advantage of being fully\nself-consistent in its treatment of the IA and lensing signals, solving for the\ntwo simultaneously. We find an IA signal consistent with zero, placing tight\nconstraints on both the magnitude of the IA effect and its potential\ncontamination to the lensing signal. While these constraints depend on source\nselection and redshift quality, the method can be applied to any measurement\nthat uses photometric redshifts. We obtain a model-independent upper-limit of\nroughly 10% IA contamination for projected separations of approximately 0.1-100\nMpc/h. With more stringent photo-z cuts and reasonable assumptions about the\nphysics of intrinsic alignments, this upper limit is reduced to 1-2%.

In this work the complex structure of the galaxy is investigated by a\ndetailed photometric decomposition of optical and near-infrared images. The\nintrinsic shape of the bulge was constrained from its apparent ellipticity, its\ntwist angle with respect to the major axis of the main disc, and the\ninclination of the main disc. The bulge is actually elongated perpendicular to\nthe main disc and it is equally likely to be triaxial or axisymmetric.

The VMC\nKs-band light curves of the Cepheids are well sampled (12-epochs) and of\nexcellent precision. We were able to measure for the first time the Ks\nmagnitude of the faintest Classical Cepheids in the LMC (Ks\\sim17.5 mag), which\nare mostly pulsating in the First Overtone (FO) mode, and to obtain FO\nPeriod-Luminosity (PL), Period-Wesenheit (PW), and Period-Luminosity-Color\n(PLC) relations, spanning the full period range from 0.25 to 6 day. Since the\nlongest period Cepheid in our dataset has a variability period of 23 day, we\nhave complemented our sample with literature data for brighter F Cepheids.

Based on Kendall's tau statistics, the probability that eclipse\ndepth depends on star metallicity is 0.981. The correlation is consistent with\nplanets orbiting low-metallicity stars being, on average, larger in comparison\nwith their host stars than planets orbiting metal-rich stars. Furthermore,\nsince metal-rich stars have smaller radii than metal-poor stars of the same\nmass and age, a uniform population of planets should show a rise in median\neclipse depth with [M/H].

Recently geographical load\nbalancing techniques have been suggested for data centers hosting cloud\ncomputation in order to reduce energy cost by exploiting the electricity price\ndifferences across regions. However, these algorithms do not draw distinction\namong diverse requirements for responsiveness across various workloads. In this\npaper, we use the flexibility from the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to\ndifferentiate among workloads under bounded latency requirements and propose a\nnovel approach for cost savings for geographical load balancing. We investigate\nhow much workload to be executed in each data center and how much workload to\nbe delayed and migrated to other data centers for energy saving while meeting\ndeadlines. We present an offline formulation for geographical load balancing\nproblem with dynamic deferral and give online algorithms to determine the\nassignment of workload to the data centers and the migration of workload\nbetween data centers in order to adapt with dynamic electricity price changes.\nWe compare our algorithms with the greedy approach and show that significant\ncost savings can be achieved by migration of workload and dynamic deferral with\nfuture electricity price prediction. We validate our algorithms on MapReduce\ntraces and show that geographic load balancing with dynamic deferral can\nprovide 20-30% cost-savings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 02:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-12"}

In this work, we choose the\nmost energetic cavity, MS 0735+7421, with stored energy ~ 10^62 erg, to\nconstrain the jet formation mechanisms and the evolution of the central massive\nblack hole in this source. The bolometric luminosity of the AGN in this cavity\nis ~ 10^(-5) L_Edd, however, the mean power of the jet required to inflate the\ncavity is estimated as ~ 0.02 L_Edd, which implies that the source has\nexperienced strong outbursts previously. During outbursts, the jet power and\nthe mass accretion rate should be significantly higher than its present values.\nWe construct an accretion disk model, in which the angular momentum and energy\ncarried away by jets is properly included, to calculate the spin and mass\nevolution of the massive black hole. In our calculations, different jet\nformation mechanisms are employed, and we find that the jets generated with the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism are unable to produce the giant cavity with ~\n10^62 erg in this source. Only the jets accelerated with the combination of the\nBlandford-Payne (BP) and BZ mechanisms can successfully inflate such a giant\ncavity, if the magnetic pressure is close to equipartition with the total\n(radiation+gas) pressure of the accretion disk.

It is widely believed that the\nl1- norm sparsity constraint on coding coefficients plays a key role in the\nsuccess of SRC, while its use of all training samples to collaboratively\nrepresent the query sample is rather ignored. In this paper we discuss how SRC\nworks, and show that the collaborative representation mechanism used in SRC is\nmuch more crucial to its success of face classification. The SRC is a special\ncase of collaborative representation based classification (CRC), which has\nvarious instantiations by applying different norms to the coding residual and\ncoding coefficient. More specifically, the l1 or l2 norm characterization of\ncoding residual is related to the robustness of CRC to outlier facial pixels,\nwhile the l1 or l2 norm characterization of coding coefficient is related to\nthe degree of discrimination of facial features.

The main obstacle here is\nthe absence of systematic (e.g. diagrammatic) way to express LDA (local density\napproximation) contribution to exchange correlation energy appearing in the\ndensity functional theory. It is not clear then, which part of interaction\nentering DMFT (dynamical mean-field theory) is already taken into account\nthrough LDA calculations. Because of that, up to now there is no accepted\nunique expression for the double counting correction in LDA+DMFT. To avoid this\nproblem we propose here the consistent LDA'+DMFT approach, where LDA exchange\ncorrelation contribution is explicitly excluded for correlated states (bands)\nduring self-consistent band structure calculations. What is left out of Coulomb\ninteraction for those strongly correlated states (bands) is its non-local part,\nwhich is not included in DMFT, and the local Hartree like contribution. Then\nthe double counting correction is uniquely reduced to the local Hartree\ncontribution. Correlations for strongly correlated states are then directly\naccounted for via the standard DMFT. We further test the consistent LDA'+DMFT\nscheme and compare it with conventional LDA+DMFT calculating the electronic\nstructure of NiO. Opposite to the conventional LDA+DMFT our consistent\nLDA'+DMFT approach unambiguously produces the insulating band structure in\nagreement with experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 07:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-29"}

A handful of \"warm\" debris disks have been discovered in the\nlast years, where emission in excess starts in the mid-infrared. An interesting\nsubset within these warm debris disks are those where emission features are\ndetected in mid-IR spectra, which points towards the presence of warm\nmicron-sized dust grains. Given the ages of the host stars, the presence of\nthese grains is puzzling, and questions their origin and survival in time. This\nstudy focuses on determining the mineralogy of the dust around 7 debris disks\nwith evidence for warm dust, based on Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic data, in order\nto provide new insights into the origin of the dust grains. We present a new\nradiative transfer code dedicated to SED modeling of optically thin disks. We\nmake use of this code on the SEDs of seven warm debris disks, in combination\nwith recent laboratory experiments on dust optical properties. We find that\nmost, if not all, debris disks in our sample are experiencing a transient\nphase, suggesting a production of small dust grains on relatively short\ntimescales. From a mineralogical point of view, we find that enstatite grains\nhave small abundances compared to crystalline olivine grains. The main result\nof our study is that we find evidences for Fe-rich crystalline olivine grains\n(Fe / [Mg + Fe] ~ 0.2) for several debris disks. This finding contrasts with\nstudies of gas-rich protoplanetary disks. The presence of Fe-rich olivine\ngrains, and the overall differences between the mineralogy of dust in Class II\ndisks compared to debris disks suggest that the transient crystalline dust is\nof a new generation. We discuss possible crystallization routes to explain our\nresults, and comment on the mechanisms that may be responsible for the\nproduction of small dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 08:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

On UT October 20.7 the comet approached the\nEarth within only 0.12 AU, and on UT November 4.6 it was visited by NASA's\nEPOXI spacecraft. We joined this international effort and organized an\nobserving campaign. The images of the comet were obtained through narrowband\nfilters using the 2-m telescope of the Rozhen National Astronomical\nObservatory. They were taken during 4 nights around the moment of the EPOXI\nencounter. Image processing methods and periodicity analysis techniques were\nused to reveal transient coma structures and investigate their repeatability\nand kinematics. We observe shells, arc-, jet- and spiral-like patterns, very\nsimilar for the CN and C3 comae. The CN features expanded outwards with the\nsky-plane projected velocities between 0.1 to 0.3 km/s. A corkscrew structure,\nobserved on November 6, evolved with a much higher velocity of 0.66 km/s.\nPhotometry of the inner coma of CN shows variability with a period of\n18.32+/-0.30 h (valid for the middle moment of our run, UT 2010 Nov. 5.0835),\nwhich we attribute to the nucleus rotation. This result is fully consistent\nwith independent determinations around the same time by other teams. The\npattern of repeatability is, however, not perfect, which is understendable\ngiven the suggested excitation of the rotation state, and the variability\ndetected in CN correlates well with the cyclic changes in HCN, but only in the\nactive phases. The revealed coma structures, along with the snapshot of the\nnucleus orientation obtained by EPOXI, let us estimate the spin axis\norientation. We obtained RA=122 deg, Dec=+16 deg (epoch J2000.0), neglecting at\nthis point the rotational excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 12:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The ML decoder helps in improving the diversity of the DF based\ndifferential cooperative system using an erroneous relaying node. We also\nderive a piecewise linear (PL) decoder of the differential data transmitted in\nthe DF based cooperative system. The proposed PL decoder significantly reduces\nthe decoding complexity as compared to the proposed ML decoder without any\nsignificant degradation in the receiver performance. Existing ML and PL\ndecoders of the differentially modulated uncoded data in the DF based\ncooperative communication system are only applicable to binary modulated\nsignals like binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and binary frequency shift keying\n(BFSK), whereas, the proposed decoders are applicable to complex-valued unitary\nand non-unitary constellations suitable for differential modulation under\nuncoded transmissions.

An approximate average SER by ignoring higher order\nnoise terms is also derived for this set-up.

We report here on a much simpler and more robust model of\nspatial pattern formation, which is formulated as a novel type of coupled map\nlattice. In our model, the local site dynamics are coupled through a\ncompetitive, rather than diffusive, interaction. Depending only on the strength\nof the interaction, this competitive coupling results in spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of a homogeneous initial configuration and the formation of stable\nspatial patterns.

This outburst lasted for about two orbital cycles and was followed by\nanother shorter and fainter outburst in June. We focus here on the broadband\nX-ray spectral evolution of the source as it spans about three order of\nmagnitudes in flux. We attempt to relate luminosity, spectral shape, local\nabsorption, and orbital phase. We use multiple Rossi-XTE/PCA (3.0--25 keV) and\nSwift/XRT (1.0--9.0 keV) observations and a 20 ks long Chandra/HETGS\nobservation (1.0--9.0 keV), to comprehensively track the spectral evolution of\nthe source during all the outbursting phases. These observations were taken\nevery two/three days and cover about four orbital cycles. The PCA data mostly\ncover the major outburst, the XRT data monitor the declining phase of the major\noutburst and all the phases of the minor outburst, and Chandra data provide an\nessential snapshot of the end of this overall outbursting phase. The X-ray\nspectrum can be satisfactorily described by a thermal Comptonization model with\nvariable neutral local absorption in all phases of the outburst. No other\nadditive component is statistically required. The first outburst decays\nlinearly, with an ankle in the light curve as the flux decreases below\n$\\sim$\\,5 $\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.

The increase\nin the number NH of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing\nkernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH\nresolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading\nresolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing\nkernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability.\nTherefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as\nsmoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear\nstability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that\nthe Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all NH, despite having\nvanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the\norigin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel\nFourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density\nestimator).
