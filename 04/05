The XMM-Newton timing calibration\nis based on pulsar analysis. However, as pulsars show both timing noise and\nglitches, it is essential to monitor these calibration sources regularly. To\nthis end, the XMM-Newton observatory performs observations twice a year of the\nCrab pulsar to monitor the absolute timing accuracy of the EPIC-pn camera in\nthe fast Timing and Burst modes. We present the results of this monitoring\ncampaign, comparing XMM-Newton data from the Crab pulsar (PSR B0531+21) with\nradio measurements. In addition, we use five pulsars (PSR J0537-69, PSR\nB0540-69, PSR B0833-45, PSR B1509-58 and PSR B1055-52) with periods ranging\nfrom 16 ms to 197 ms to verify the relative timing accuracy. We analysed 38\nXMM-Newton observations (0.2-12.0 keV) of the Crab taken over the first ten\nyears of the mission and 13 observations from the five complementary pulsars.\nAll the data were processed with the SAS, the XMM-Newton Scientific Analysis\nSoftware, version 9.0. Epoch folding techniques coupled with \\chi^{2} tests\nwere used to derive relative timing accuracies. The absolute timing accuracy\nwas determined using the Crab data and comparing the time shift between the\nmain X-ray and radio peaks in the phase folded light curves. The relative\ntiming accuracy of XMM-Newton is found to be better than 10^{-8}. The strongest\nX-ray pulse peak precedes the corresponding radio peak by 306\\pm9 \\mus, which\nis in agreement with other high energy observatories such as Chandra, INTEGRAL\nand RXTE. The derived absolute timing accuracy from our analysis is \\pm48 \\mus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 16:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It had a 32% Iron-Nickel-Sulfur core supporting\na dynamo, which explains magnetized lunar rocks. Following capture, it was torn\napart by tidal forces and its core of iron plastered itself, with some of its\nrock mantle, on the surface of Earth at a very flat angle (producing the \"Late\nVeneer\"). After tidal stripping, the remaining PM rock was driven away from\nEarth to about 3.8 times Earth's radius and formed into what is now the Moon.\nThe GI theory has several troubles: The violent collision melts the entire\nEarth, contrary to geological evidence.

A\nPUF is defined as a hardware device which implements a physical function with\nan output value that changes with its argument. A PUF can be clonable, but a\nsecure PUF must be unclonable. This proposed meaning of a PUF is cleanly\ndelineated from the closely related concepts of \"conventional unclonable\nfunction\", \"physically obfuscated key\", \"random-number generator\", \"controlled\nPUF\" and \"strong PUF\". The structure of a systematic security evaluation of a\nPUF enabled by the proposed formal definition is outlined.

Mathematical modeling\nis used as a systems biology tool to answer biological questions, and more\nprecisely, to validate a network that describes biological observations and to\npredict the effect of perturbations.\n  We propose a modeling approach that is intrinsically continuous in time. The\nalgorithm presented here fills the gap between qualitative and quantitative\nmodeling. It is based on continuous time Markov process applied on a Boolean\nstate space. In order to describe the temporal evolution, we explicitly specify\nthe transition rates for each node. For that purpose, we built a language that\ncan be seen as a generalization of Boolean equations. The values of transition\nrates have a natural interpretation: it is the inverse of the time for the\ntransition to occur. Mathematically, this approach can be translated in a set\nof ordinary differential equations on probability distributions; therefore, it\ncan be seen as an approach in between quantitative and qualitative.\n  We developed a C++ software, MaBoSS, that is able to simulate such a system\nby applying Kinetic Monte-Carlo (or Gillespie algorithm) in the Boolean state\nspace. This software, parallelized and optimized, computes temporal evolution\nof probability distributions and can also estimate stationary distributions.\nApplications of Boolean Kinetic Monte-Carlo have been demonstrated for two\nqualitative models: a toy model and a published p53/Mdm2 model. Our approach\nallows to describe kinetic phenomena which were difficult to handle in the\noriginal models. In particular, transient effects are represented by time\ndependent probability distributions, interpretable in terms of cell\npopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 16:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2012 13:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-30"}

This method of\nage estimation is simpler than optical spectroscopy, and is more useful for\nyoung embedded clusters where optical spectrocopy is not possible. In the\nyoungest clusters, the protostar fraction decreases outward from the densest\ngas, indicating that the local star-forming age increases outward from a few\n0.1 Myr in small protostar-dominated zones to a few Myr in large PMS-dominated\nzones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 19:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Here we present a\nphase-connected timing analysis and the evolution of the flux and spectral\nproperties using RXTE, Swift, and Chandra observations. We measure a spin\nfrequency of 0.1185154343(8) s$^{-1}$ and a frequency derivative of\n$-4.3\\pm0.3\\times10^{-15}$ at MJD 55761.0, in a timing analysis that include\nsignificant non-zero second and third frequency derivatives that we attribute\nto timing noise.

To accommodate the dependence, these\nresampling methods involve a bandwidth parameter, such as subsampling window\nwidth and block size in the block-based bootstrap. In empirical work, using\ndifferent bandwidth parameters could lead to different inference results, but\nthe traditional first order asymptotic theory does not capture the choice of\nthe bandwidth. In this article, we propose to adopt the fixed-b approach, as\nadvocated by Kiefer and Vogelsang (2005) in the\nheteroscedasticity-autocorrelation robust testing context, to account for the\ninfluence of the bandwidth on the inference. Under the fixed-b asymptotic\nframework, we derive the asymptotic null distribution of the p-values for\nsubsampling and the moving block bootstrap, and further propose a calibration\nof the traditional small-b based confidence intervals (regions, bands) and\ntests. Our treatment is fairly general as it includes both finite dimensional\nparameters and infinite dimensional parameters, such as marginal distribution\nfunction and normalized spectral distribution function. Simulation results show\nthat the fixed-b approach is more accurate than the traditional small-b\napproach in terms of approximating the finite sample distribution, and that the\ncalibrated confidence sets tend to have smaller coverage errors than the\nuncalibrated counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 19:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-05"}

Using an innovative technique in which we\nrepresent the changing spacetime in the region occupied by the orbiting matter\nwith a 2.5PN approximation and the binary orbital evolution with 3.5PN, we have\nsimulated the MHD evolution of a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal-mass\nnon-spinning binary. Prior to the beginning of the inspiral, the structure of\nthe circumbinary disk is predicted well by extrapolation from Newtonian\nresults. The binary opens a low-density gap whose radius is roughly two binary\nseparations, and matter piles up at the outer edge of this gap as inflow is\nretarded by torques exerted by the binary; nonetheless, the accretion rate is\ndiminished relative to its value at larger radius by only about a factor of 2.\nDuring inspiral, the inner edge of the disk at first moves inward in\ncoordination with the shrinking binary, but as the orbital evolution\naccelerates, the rate at which the inner edge moves toward smaller radii falls\nbehind the rate of binary compression. In this stage, the rate of angular\nmomentum transfer from the binary to the disk slows substantially, but the net\naccretion rate decreases by only 10-20%. When the binary separation is tens of\ngravitational radii, the rest-mass efficiency of disk radiation is a few\npercent, suggesting that supermassive binary black holes in galactic nuclei\ncould be very luminous at this stage of their evolution. If the luminosity were\noptically thin, it would be modulated at a frequency that is a beat between the\norbital frequency of the disk's surface density maximum and the binary orbital\nfrequency. However, a disk with sufficient surface density to be luminous\nshould also be optically thick; as a result, the periodic modulation may be\nsuppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 21:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It is confirmed that residuals in the Tully-Fisher\nrelation are correlated with surface brightness, but that even after\naccommodating the surface brightness dependence through the dwarf fundamental\nplane, residuals in absolute magnitude are far larger than expected from\nobservational errors. Rather, a more fundamental plane is identified which\nconnects the potential to HI line width and surface brightness. Residuals\ncorrelate with the axis ratio in a way which can be accommodated by recognizing\nthe galaxies to be oblate spheroids viewed at varying angles. Correction of\nsurface brightnesses to face-on leads to a correlation among the potential,\nline width, and surface brightness for which residuals are entirely\nattributable to observational uncertainties. The mean mass-to-light ratio of\nthe diffuse component of the galaxies is constrained to be 0.88 +/- 0.20 in Ks.\nBlue compact dwarfs lie in the same plane as dwarf irregulars. The dependence\nof the potential on line width is less strong than expected for virialized\nsystems, but this may be because surface brightness is acting as a proxy for\nvariations in the mass-to-light ratio from galaxy to galaxy. Altogether, the\nobservations suggest that gas motions are predominantly disordered and\nisotropic, that they are a consequence of gravity, not turbulence, and that the\nmass and scale of dark matter haloes scale with the amount and distribution of\nluminous matter. The tight relationship between the potential and observables\noffers the promise of determining distances to unresolved star-forming dwarfs\nto an accuracy comparable to that provided by the Tully-Fisher relation for\nspirals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 21:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-06"}

We\ninvestigate two nonlinear single-source confidence measures, using the mutual\ninformation and a local linear tangent space approximation (LTSA). For this\nlatter measure, we derive two extensions of linear single-source measures,\nrespectively based on correlation (LTSA-correlation) and eigenvalues\n(LTSA-PCA). A second novelty of our approach consists of applying functional\ndata clustering techniques to the scattered observations in the above\nsingle-source zones, thus allowing us to accurately estimate them.We first\nstudy a classical approach using a B-spline approximation, and then two\napproaches which locally approximate the nonlinear functions as lines. Finally,\nwe extend our PNL methods to more general nonlinear mixtures. Combining\nsingle-source zones and functional data clustering allows us to tackle speech\nsignals, which has never been performed by other PNL-SCA methods.

The medial prefrontal cortex(mPFC) is a\ncritically important brain region required for plasticity of stress resilience.\nWe found that control over stress induces plasticity of the intrinsic\nvoltage-gated conductances of pyramidal neurons in the PFC. To gain insight\ninto the underlying biophysical mechanisms of this plasticity we used the\nconductance- based neural simulation software tool, NEURON, to model the\nincrease in membrane excitability associated with resilience to stress. A ball\nand stick multicompartment conductance-based model was used to realistically\nfit passive and active data traces from prototypical pyramidal neurons in\nneurons in rats with control over tail shock stress and those lacking control.\nThe results indicate that the plasticity of membrane excitability associated\nwith control over stress can be attributed to an increase in Na+ and Ca2+\nT-type conductances and an increase in the leak conductance. Using simulated\ndendritic synaptic inputs we observed an increase in excitatory postsynaptic\nsummation and amplification resulting in elevated action potential output. This\nrealistic simulation suggests that control over stress enhances the output of\nthe PFC and offers specific testable hypotheses to guide future\nelectrophysiological mechanistic studies in animal models of resilience and\nvulnerability to stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2012 23:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-06"}

The non-perturbative conditions that we\nconcentrate on in this paper are confined to be either the presence of\nnon-trivial boundary conditions or non-perturbative background fields. We show\nthat these non-perturbative conditions have profound effects on all physical\nproperties of the system and our renormalization program is consistent with\nthese conditions. We formulate the general renormalization program in the\nconfiguration space. The differences between the free space renormalization\nprogram and ours manifest themselves in the counter-terms as well, which we\nshall elucidate. The general expressions that we obtain for the counter-terms\nreduce to the standard results in the free space cases. We show that the\ndifferences between these divergent counter-terms are extremely small. Moreover\nwe argue that the position dependences induced on the parameters of the\nrenormalized Lagrangian via the loop corrections, however small, are direct and\nnatural consequences of the non-perturbative position dependent conditions\nimposed on the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 03:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2013 12:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-29"}

We construct the discrete position wave\nfunctions, which are given in terms of certain Krawtchouk polynomials. These\nwave functions have appealing properties, as can already be seen from their\nplots. The model is sufficiently simple, in the sense that the corresponding\ndiscrete Fourier transform (relating position wave functions to momentum wave\nfunctions) can be constructed explicitly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 07:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-03"}

Such a system of vortices with\nnon-Abelian Dirac fermions appears in color superconductors at extremely high\ndensities, and in supersymmetric QCD. We show that the exchange of two vortices\nhaving doublet Dirac fermions in each core is expressed by non-Abelian\nrepresentations of a braid group, which is explicitly verified in the matrix\nrepresentation of the exchange operators when the number of vortices is up to\nfour. We find that the result contains the matrices previously obtained for the\nvortices with a single Dirac fermion in each core as a special case. The whole\nbraid group does not immediately imply non-Abelian statistics of identical\nparticles because it also contains exchanges between vortices with different\nnumbers of Dirac fermions.

Furthermore,\nwe usually only have one data set from which to measure the observed low-l\nsplitting. In such circumstances the inferred internal rotation rate of a main\nsequence star could differ significantly from estimates of the surface rotation\nrate, hence leading to spurious conclusions.

This result should not be a surprise\nsince the asymmetry observable directly explores the far ultraviolet sector of\nthe spacelike domain of the Minkowski spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 10:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 10:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2013 13:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-12"}

Despite infinite tidal forces the geodesics pass through the\nsingularity. Due to the dust component, the Hubble parameter has a non-zero\nvalue at the encounter with the singularity, therefore the dust implies further\nexpansion. With continued expansion however, the energy density and the\npressure of the anti-Chaplygin gas would become ill-defined, hence from the\npoint of view of the anti-Chaplygin gas only a contraction is allowed.\nParadoxically, the universe in this cosmological model would have to expand and\ncontract simultaneously.

Recent application to a sample of CSPNs\nraised questions regarding the validity of the theoretical mass-luminosity\nrelation of CSPNs.\n  Aims: The results of the earlier UV analysis are reassessed by means of a\nsimultaneous comparison of observed optical and UV spectra with corresponding\nsynthetic spectra.\n  Methods: Using published stellar parameters (a) from a consistent UV analysis\nand (b) from fits to optical H and He lines, we calculate simultaneous optical\nand UV spectra with our model atmosphere code, which has been improved by\nimplementing Stark broadening for H and He lines.\n  Results: Spectra computed with the parameter sets from the UV analysis yield\ngood agreement to the observations, but spectra computed with the stellar\nparameters from the published optical analysis and using corresponding\nconsistent wind parameters show large discrepancies to both the observed\noptical and UV spectra. The published optical analyses give good fits to the\nobserved spectrum only because the wind parameters assumed in these analyses\nare inconsistent with their stellar parameters. By enforcing consistency\nbetween stellar and wind parameters, stellar parameters are obtained which\ndisagree with the core-mass-luminosity relation for the objects analyzed.

In this article we will present a\nnovel approximate Newton algorithm for the optimisation of such models. The\nalgorithm has various desirable properties over the naive application of\nNewton's method. Firstly the approximate Hessian is guaranteed to be\nnegative-semidefinite over the entire parameter space in the case where the\ncontroller is log-concave in the control parameters. Additionally the inference\nrequired for our approximate Newton method is often the same as that required\nfor first order methods, such as steepest gradient ascent. The approximate\nHessian also has many nice sparsity properties that are not present in the\nHessian and that make its inversion efficient in many situations of interest.\nWe also provide an analysis that highlights a relationship between our\napproximate Newton method and both Expectation Maximisation and natural\ngradient ascent. Empirical results suggest that the algorithm has excellent\nconvergence and robustness properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 13:44:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2012 10:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 14:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 16:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

This problem can be\nrestated as finding the number of solutions of a related system of quadratic\nequations and in this context it is natural to consider the number of solutions\nin ${\\mathbb C}^2$ rather that ${\\mathbb R}^2$. We show that the number of\ncomplex solutions, $c(G)$, is the same for all generic realisations of a rigid\ngraph $G$, characterise the graphs $G$ for which $c(G)=1$, and show that the\nproblem of determining $c(G)$ can be reduced to the case when $G$ is\n$3$-connected and has no non-trivial $3$-edge-cuts. We consider the effect of\nthe Henneberg moves and the vertex-splitting operation on $c(G)$. We use our\nresults to determine $c(G)$ exactly for two important families of graphs, and\nshow that the graphs in both families have $c(G)$ pairwise equivalent generic\nreal realisations. We also show that every planar isostatic graph on $n$\nvertices has at least $2^{n-3}$ pairwise equivalent real realisations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 13:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 15:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

Strain engineering utilized by the CMOS\nindustry reduces the relative occupancy of the \\Delta 4 states resulting in\nless overall surface roughness scattering in the channel.

The copolymer interacts\nwith the micro-emulsion through an interaction Hamiltonian that favors matches\nand disfavors mismatches between the monomers and the solvents, in such a way\nthat the interaction with the oil is stronger than with the water.\n  The configurations of the copolymers are directed self-avoiding paths in\nwhich only steps up, down and right are allowed. The configurations of the\nmicro-emulsion are square blocks with oil and water arranged in\npercolation-type fashion. The only restriction imposed on the path is that in\nevery column of blocks its vertical displacement on the block scale is bounded.\nThe way in which the copolymer enters and exits successive columns of blocks is\na directed self-avoiding path as well, but on the block scale. We refer to this\npath as the coarse-grained self-avoiding path. We are interested in the limit\nas the copolymer and the blocks become large, in such a way that the copolymer\nspends a long time in each block yet visits many blocks. This is a\ncoarse-graining limit in which the space-time scales of the copolymer and of\nthe micro-emulsion become separated.\n  We derive a variational formula for the quenched free energy per monomer,\nwhere quenched means that the disorder in the copolymer and the disorder in the\nmicro-emulsion are both frozen. In a sequel paper we will analyze this\nvariational formula and identify the phase diagram. It turns out that there are\ntwo regimes, supercritical and subcritical, depending on whether the oil blocks\npercolate or not along the coarse-grained self-avoiding path. The phase\ndiagrams in the two regimes turn out to be completely different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 14:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-06"}

Due to the inability of\nrechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time, a\nconstraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint, two rechargeable energy\nstorage devices (ESDs) are assumed so that at any given time, there is always\none ESD being recharged. The energy harvesting rate is assumed to be a random\nvariable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A\nsave-then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time\n{\\rho} (dubbed the save-ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting,\nwith the remaining fraction 1 - {\\rho} used for data transmission. The ratio of\nthe energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the energy\nstorage efficiency, {\\eta}. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD\nbeing a battery with {\\eta} < 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with\n{\\eta} = 1. The optimal save-ratio that minimizes outage probability is\nderived, from which some useful design guidelines are drawn. In addition, we\ncompare the outage performance of random power supply to that of constant power\nsupply over the Rayleigh fading channel. The diversity order with random power\nis shown to be the same as that of constant power, but the performance gap can\nbe large. Furthermore, we extend the proposed ST protocol to wireless networks\nwith multiple transmitters. It is shown that the system-level outage\nperformance is critically dependent on the relationship between the number of\ntransmitters and the optimal save-ratio for single-channel outage minimization.\nNumerical results are provided to validate our proposed study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 14:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 01:45:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2013 04:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-07"}

State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the\nexplicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case if\nscalability should be maintained. There are few if any implicit feedback\nbenchmark datasets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit\nbenchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback\nrecommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS apply a fast, ALS-based tensor\nfactorization learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero\nelements in the tensor. The method also allows us to incorporate diverse\ncontext information into the model while maintaining its computational\nefficiency. In particular, we present two such context-aware implementation\nvariants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to\ndistinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the user\nhistory as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usage\npattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart\nproduct types or categories that are typically purchased repetitively\n(collectibles, grocery goods) or once (household appliances). Experiments\nperformed on three implicit datasets (two proprietary ones and an implicit\nvariant of the Netflix dataset) show that by integrating context-aware\ninformation with our factorization framework into the state-of-the-art implicit\nrecommender algorithm the recommendation quality improves significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 15:34:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2013 15:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-05"}

So Intrusion Detection Systems have\nbecome a needful component in terms of computer and network security. There are\nvarious approaches being utilized in intrusion detections, but unfortunately\nany of the systems so far is not completely flawless. So, the quest of\nbetterment continues. In this progression, here we present an Intrusion\nDetection System (IDS), by applying genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently\ndetect various types of network intrusions. Parameters and evolution processes\nfor GA are discussed in details and implemented. This approach uses evolution\ntheory to information evolution in order to filter the traffic data and thus\nreduce the complexity. To implement and measure the performance of our system\nwe used the KDD99 benchmark dataset and obtained reasonable detection rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2012 11:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-09"}

The contributions of these excluded segments depend on\nthe distribution of the current in the cross section of the wire. They add to a\nsimple constant proportional to the wire length.
