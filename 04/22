For both compounds, the Th3P4-type was\nsynthesized experimentally at high-pressure conditions and was quenched to\nambient conditions. Computations reveal that while at high pressure Th3P4-type\nstructures are favored by enthalpy, at low pressure the Th3P4-type is only\nmeta-stable. The spinel-type is energetically more favorable at zero pressure\nthan the Th3P4- type in both systems. However, even the spinel-type is\nsurpassed by another ground state modification for both Hf3N4 and Ti3N4. The\nresearch presented in this thesis then addresses (i) thermal stability of the\nTh3P4 polymorphs and (ii) the conditions necessary to synthesize spinel-type\nstructures of both compounds. The foundation for the study is a simple\nstructural relation between Th3P4-type and the spinel-type structures: while\nthe Th3P4-type is based on a body-centered cubic arrangement of anions with\ncations in interstitial sites, the spinel-type is best described by a\nface-centered cubic arrangement of anions with cations in interstitial sites.\nWith anions following the Bain path of the bcc-fcc transformation, and cations\nundergoing a minor shuffle distortion, the Th3P4 to spinel transformation\nparallels the martensitic transformation known in many metal systems -- only\nwith additional cations in the structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2012 16:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-25"}

We discuss the distance to the source taking\nthe high inclination into account and we conclude that the source distance is\nprobably 6+-2 kpc. The lowest observed flux corresponds to a luminosity of\n2x10^31 (d/6 kpc)^2 erg/s This, together with the orbital period of 2.4 hr\nreported in the literature, suggests that the quiescent X-ray luminosity is\nhigher than predicted on the basis of the orbital period -- quiescent X-ray\nluminosity relationship.

We determine the behaviour\nof MAXI J1659-152 in the radio -- X-ray diagram at low X-ray luminosities using\nthe observations reported in this paper and at high X-ray luminosities using\nvalues reported in the literature. At high X-ray luminosities the source lies\ncloser to the sources that follow a correlation index steeper than 0.6-0.7.\nHowever, when compared to other sources that follow a steeper correlation\nindex, the X-ray luminosity in MAXI J1659-152 is also lower. The latter can\npotentially be explained by the high inclination of MAXI J1659-152 if the X-ray\nemission comes from close to the source and the radio emission is originating\nin a more extended region. However, it is probable that the source was not in\nthe canonical low-hard state during these radio observations and this may\naffect the behaviour of the source as well. At intermediate X-ray luminosities\nthe source makes the transition from the radio underluminous sources in the\ndirection of the relation traced by the 'standard' correlation similar to what\nhas been reported for H1743-322.

The piled-up shocked matter emits\nthermal radiation and a population of locally accelerated relativistic\nparticles is expected to produce non-thermal emission over a wide range of\nenergies.

Zero-field tunneling spectra show two superconducting\ngaps without detectable spectral weight near the Fermi energy, evidencing\nfully-gapped multi-band superconductivity. We image vortices in a wide field\nrange from 0.1 T to 11 T by mapping the tunneling conductance at the Fermi\nenergy. A quasi-hexagonal vortex lattice at low field contains domain\nboundaries which consist of alternating vortices with unusual coordination\nnumbers of 5 and 7. With increasing field, the domain boundaries become\nill-defined, resulting in a uniformly disordered vortex matter. Tunneling\nspectra taken at the vortex center are characterized by a sharp peak just below\nthe Fermi energy, apparently violating particlehole symmetry. The image of each\nvortex shows energy-dependent 4-fold anisotropy which may be associated with\nthe anisotropy of the Fermi surface. The vortex radius shrinks with decreasing\ntemperature and becomes smaller than the coherence length estimated from the\nupper critical field. This is direct evidence of the Kramer-Pesch effect\nexpected in a clean superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2012 06:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-24"}

For radial\nnetworks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there\nare no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always\nexact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to\ndetermine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification\nof mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network\ncan always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that\nconvexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the\nnetwork and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power\nflows, generation, loads, or operating constraints.

As a first systematic study of\nType 1s, we obtained mid-/near-IR data for small samples over ~3-4 orders of\nmagnitudes in UV luminosity L of the central engine. Here we effectively trace\nthe structure by observing dust grains that are radiatively heated by the\ncentral engine. Consistent with a naive expectation for such dust grains, the\ndust sublimation radius R_in is in fact empirically known to be scaling with\nL^1/2 from the near-IR reverberation measurements, and this is also supported\nby our near-IR interferometry. Utilizing this empirical relationship, we\nnormalize the radial extent by R_in and eliminate the simple L^1/2 scaling for\na direct comparison over the samples. We then find that, in the mid-IR, the\noverall size in units of R_in seems to become more compact in higher luminosity\nsources. More specifically, the mid-IR brightness distribution is rather well\ndescribed by a power-law, and this power-law becomes steeper in higher\nluminosity objects. The near-IR flux does not seem to be a simple inward\nextrapolation of the mid-IR power-law component toward shorter wavelengths, but\nit rather comes from a little distinct brightness concentration at the inner\nrim region of the dust distribution. Its structure is not well constrained yet,\nbut there is tentative evidence that this inner near-IR-emitting structure has\na steeper radial distribution in jet-launching objects. All these should be\nscrutinized with further observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2012 09:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Analytic properties of S(F) are related\nto dynamical properties of chiF. The Riemann-Lebesque lemma implies that if\nchiF is minimal, then S(F) is convex and hence S(F) is the closure of the\nconvex hull of its extreme points Se(F). In this paper we (i) review the\nrelationship between these concepts and the special case of the still open 1959\nKadison-Singer problem called Feichtinger's conjecture for exponential\nfunctions, (ii) partially characterize of elements in Se(F), for minimal chiF,\nin terms of ergodic properties of (O(F),lambda) where lambda is a shift\ninvariant probability measure whose existence in ensured by the 1937\nKrylov-Bogoyubov theorem, (iii) refine previous numerical studies of the\nMorse-Thue minimal binary sequence by exploiting a new MATLAB algorithm for\ncomputing smallest eigenvalues of 4,000,000 x 4,000,000 matrices, (iv) describe\nrecent results characterizing S(F) for certain Bohr sets F related to\nquasicrystals, (v) extend these concepts to general discrete groups including\nthose with Kazhdan's T-property, such as SL(n,Z), n > 2, which can be\ncharacterized by several equivalent properties such as: any sequence of\npositive definite functions converging to 1 uniformly on compact subsets\nconverges uniformly. This exotic property may be useful to construct a\ncounterexample to the generalization of Feichtinger's conjecture and hence to\nprovide a no answer to the question of Kadison and Singer whcih they themselves\ntended to suspect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2012 15:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}

The energy harvester has no buffer\nto store the harvested energy and hence the energy need to be expended\nimmediately. We assume that the decoder has perfect knowledge of the energy\nharvesting process. We characterize the capacity region of such a GMAC. We also\nprovide the capacity region when one of the users has infinite buffer to store\nthe energy harvested. Next we find the achievable rates when the energy\nharvesting information is not available at the decoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Apr 2012 15:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}
