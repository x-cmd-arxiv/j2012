However, these algorithms are considerably\nslow because they operate on individual bits; and are only designed to run over\nsingle-processor computers. In this paper, two algorithms for handling\narithmetic addition on big-integer numbers are presented. The first algorithm\nis sequential while the second is parallel.

However, the large\ncontrast ratio of the brightness of each object to that of its parent star\nlimits our ability to extract a clean spectrum, free from any significant\ncontribution from the star. During the development of the long slit\nspectroscopy (LSS) mode of IRDIS, the dual-band imager and spectrograph of\nSPHERE, we proposed a data analysis method to estimate and remove the\ncontributions of the stellar spectrum. This method has never been tested on\nreal data because of the lack of instrumentation capable of combining adaptive\noptics (AO), coronagraphy, and LSS. Nonetheless, a similar attenuation of the\nstar can be obtained using a particular observing configuration. Test data were\nacquired using the AO-assisted spectrograph VLT/NACO. We obtained new J- and\nH-band spectra of SCR J1845-6357 B, a T6 companion to a nearby (3.85\\pm0.02 pc)\nM8 star. This system is a well-suited benchmark as it is relatively wide\n(~1.0\") with a modest contrast ratio (~4 mag), and a previously published JHK\nspectrum is available for reference. We demonstrate that (1) our method is\nefficient at estimating and removing the stellar contribution, (2) it allows to\nproperly recover the spectral shape of the companion, and (3) it is essential\nto obtain an unbiased estimation of physical parameters. We also show that the\nslit configuration associated with this method allows us to use long exposure\ntimes with high throughput producing high signal-to-noise ratio data. However,\nthe signal of the companion gets over-subtracted, particularly in our J-band\ndata, compelling us to use a fake companion spectrum to estimate and compensate\nfor the loss of flux. Finally, we report a new astrometric measurement of the\nposition of the companion (sep = 0.817\", PA = 227.92 deg).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2012 16:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Inflation is followed by a Peccei-Quinn phase transition, based on\nrenormalizable superpotential terms, which resolves the strong CP and mu\nproblems of MSSM and provide masses lower than about 10^12 GeV for the\nright-handed (RH) (s)neutrinos. Baryogenesis occurs via non-thermal\nleptogenesis, realized by the out-of-equilibrium decay of the RH sneutrinos\nwhich are produced by the inflaton's decay.

The precise collapse process\nitself, however, is not yet fully understood. Strong winds, outbursts, and\nintense ionizing UV radiation from single stars or strongly interacting\nbinaries are expected to destroy the molecular cloud cores that give birth to\nthem and create highly complex circumburst environments for the explosion. Such\nenvironments might imprint features on GRB light curves that uniquely identify\nthe nature of the progenitor and its collapse. We have performed numerical\nsimulations of realistic environments for a variety of long-duration GRB\nprogenitors with ZEUS-MP, and have developed an analytical method for\ncalculating GRB light curves in these profiles. Though a full,\nthree-dimensional, relativistic magnetohydrodynamical computational model is\nrequired to precisely describe the light curve from a GRB in complex\nenvironments, our method can provide a qualitative understanding of these\nphenomena. We find that, in the context of the standard afterglow model,\nmassive shells around GRBs produce strong signatures in their light curves, and\nthat this can distinguish them from those occurring in uniform media or steady\nwinds. These features can constrain the mass of the shell and the properties of\nthe wind before and after the ejection. Moreover, the interaction of the GRB\nwith the circumburst shell is seen to produce features that are consistent with\nobserved X-ray flares that are often attributed to delayed energy injection by\nthe central engine. Our algorithm for computing light curves is also applicable\nto GRBs in a variety of environments such as those in high-redshift\ncosmological halos or protogalaxies, both of which will soon be targets of\nfuture surveys such as JANUS or Lobster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Apr 2012 20:04:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 17:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2012 17:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The distortions are responsible for long-range effective\ncolloidal interactions whose asymptotic behaviour is well understood. The short\ndistance behaviour of the interaction, however, is sensitive to the structure\nand dynamics of the topological defects nucleated near the colloidal particles\nin the strong anchoring regime. The full non-linear theory is required in order\nto determine the interaction at short separations. Spherical colloidal\nparticles with sufficiently strong planar degenerate anchoring nucleate a pair\nof antipodal surface topological defects, known as boojums. We use the\nLandau-de Gennes formalism in order to resolve the mesoscopic structure of the\nboojum cores and to determine the pairwise colloidal interaction. We compare\nthe results in three (3D) and two (2D) spatial dimensions. The corresponding\nfree energy functionals are minimized numerically using finite elements with\nadaptive meshes. Boojums are always point-like in 2D, but acquire a rather\ncomplex structure in 3D which depends on the combination of the anchoring\npotential, the radius of the colloid, the temperature and the LC elastic\nanisotropy. We identify three types of defect cores in 3D which we call single,\ndouble and split core boojums, and investigate the associated structural\ntransitions. In the presence of two colloidal particles there are substantial\nre-arrangements of the defects at short distances, both in 3D and 2D. These\nre-arrangements lead to qualitative changes in the force-distance profile when\ncompared to the asymptotic quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. In line with the\nexperimental results, the presence of the defects prevents coalescence of the\ncolloidal particles in 2D, but not in 3D systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 01:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In the context of consensus problems, the\nunreliability of communication links between nodes has been traditionally\nmodeled by allowing the underlying graph to vary with time. In other words,\ndepending on the realization of the link erasures, the underlying graph at each\ntime instant is assumed to be a subgraph of the original graph. Implicit in\nthis model is the assumption that the erasures are symmetric: if at time t the\npacket from node i to node j is dropped, the same is true for the packet\ntransmitted from node j to node i. However, in practical wireless communication\nsystems this assumption is unreasonable and, due to the lack of symmetry,\nstandard averaging protocols cannot guarantee that the network will reach\nconsensus to the true average. In this paper we explore the use of channel\ncoding to improve the performance of consensus algorithms. For symmetric\nerasures, we show that, for certain ranges of the system parameters, repetition\ncodes can speed up the convergence rate. For asymmetric erasures we show that\ntree codes (which have recently been designed for erasure channels) can be used\nto simulate the performance of the original \"unerased\" graph. Thus, unlike\nconventional consensus methods, we can guarantee convergence to the average in\nthe asymmetric case. The price is a slowdown in the convergence rate, relative\nto the unerased network, which is still often faster than the convergence rate\nof conventional consensus algorithms over noisy links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 02:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-03"}

These temperature limits are obtained without recourse to\ninverse Compton effects or the condition of equipartition of energy between\nmagnetic fields and relativistic particles. For radio variables, the intra-day\nvariability (IDV) implies brightness temperatures $\\sim 10^{19}$ K in the\nco-moving rest frame of the source. This, if interpreted purely due to an\nincoherent synchrotron emission, would imply gyro radii $>10^{28}$ cm, the size\nof the universe, while from the causality arguments the inferred maximum size\nof the source in such a case is $\\stackrel{<}{_{\\sim}} 10^{15}$ cm. Such high\nbrightness temperatures are sometimes modeled in the literature as some\ncoherent emission process where bunches of non-thermal particles are somehow\nformed that radiate in phase. We show that, unlike in case of curvature\nradiation models proposed in pulsars, in the synchrotron radiation mechanism\nthe oppositely charged particles would contribute together to the coherent\nphenomenon without the need to form separate bunches of the opposite charges.\nAt the same time we show that bunches would disperse over dimensions larger\nthan a wavelength in time shorter than the gyro orbital period\n($\\stackrel{<}{_{\\sim}}0.1$ sec). Therefore a coherent emission by bunches\ncannot be a plausible explanation of the high brightness temperatures inferred\nin extragalactic radio sources showing variability over a few hours or longer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 04:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

We hope that our approach helps in understanding the role noncommutative\ngeometry could play in describing particle physics models, eventually unifying\nthem with Einstein's (geometrical) theory of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 07:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 02:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-16"}

In order\nto evaluate the error performance of LDPC codes, simulators running on CPUs are\ncommonly used. However, the time taken to evaluate LDPC codes with very good\nerror performance is excessive. In this paper, efficient LDPC block-code\ndecoders/simulators which run on graphics processing units (GPUs) are proposed.\nWe also implement the decoder for the LDPC convolutional code (LDPCCC). The\nLDPCCC is derived from a pre-designed quasi-cyclic LDPC block code with good\nerror performance. Compared to the decoder based on the randomly constructed\nLDPCCC code, the complexity of the proposed LDPCCC decoder is reduced due to\nthe periodicity of the derived LDPCCC and the properties of the quasi-cyclic\nstructure. In our proposed decoder architecture, $\\Gamma$ (a multiple of a\nwarp) codewords are decoded together and hence the messages of $\\Gamma$\ncodewords are also processed together. Since all the $\\Gamma$ codewords share\nthe same Tanner graph, messages of the $\\Gamma$ distinct codewords\ncorresponding to the same edge can be grouped into one package and stored\nlinearly. By optimizing the data structures of the messages used in the\ndecoding process, both the read and write processes can be performed in a\nhighly parallel manner by the GPUs. In addition, a thread hierarchy minimizing\nthe divergence of the threads is deployed, and it can maximize the efficiency\nof the parallel execution. With the use of a large number of cores in the GPU\nto perform the simple computations simultaneously, our GPU-based LDPC decoder\ncan obtain hundreds of times speedup compared with a serial CPU-based simulator\nand over 40 times speedup compared with an 8-thread CPU-based simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 07:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 02:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}

This event followed other recent IPOs in the world of social\nnetworking companies, such as Groupon or Linkedin among others. With a\nvaluation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga became\none of the biggest web IPOs since Google. This recent enthusiasm for social\nnetworking companies raises the question whether they are overvalued. Indeed,\nduring the few months since its IPO, Zynga showed significant variability, its\nmarket capitalization going from 5.6 to 10.2 billion USD, hinting at a possible\nirrational behavior from the market. To bring substance to the debate, we\npropose a two-tiered approach to compute the intrinsic value of Zynga. First,\nwe introduce a new model to forecast its user base, based on the individual\ndynamics of its major games. Next, we model the revenues per user using a\nlogistic function, a standard model for growth in competition. This allows us\nto bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios: 3.4, 4.0 and\n4.8 billion USD in the base case, high growth and extreme growth scenario\nrespectively. This suggests that Zynga has been overpriced ever since its IPO.\nFinally, we propose an investment strategy (dated April 19th, 2012 on the\narXive), which is based on our diagnostic of a bubble for Zynga and how this\nherding / bubbly sentiment can be expected to play together with two important\ncoming events (the quarterly financial result announcement around April 26th,\n2012 followed by the end of a first lock-up period around April 30th, 2012). On\nthe long term, our analysis indicates that Zynga's price should decrease\nsignificantly. The paper ends with a post-mortem analysis added on May 24th,\n2012, just before going to press, showing that we have successfully predicted\nthe downward trend of Zynga. Since April 27th, 2012, Zynga dropped 25%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 09:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 18:13:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 May 2012 14:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-28"}

The emission from the group alone has a total\nluminosity of ~1x10^40 erg/s in the (0.5-5) keV band. Most of the luminosity\ncan be attributed to the individual sources in the galaxies, and only ~2x10^39\nerg/s is due to a gaseous component.

As an example, we apply this\nmethod to the case of a scalar field on a black hole toy-model spacetime, the\nPleba{\\'n}ski-Hacyan spacetime, $\\mathbb{M}_2\\times\\mathbb{S}^2$. The method\nallows us to determine in an exact manner that the singularity structure of the\n`direct' term in the Hadamard form for $G_R(x',x)$ changes from a form\n$\\delta(\\sigma)$ to `$1/\\pi\\sigma$' after the null geodesic joining $x$ and\n$x'$ has crossed a caustic point, where $\\sigma$ is the world function.\nFurthermore, there is a change of form from a $\\theta(-\\sigma)$ to a\n`$-\\ln|\\sigma|/\\pi$' in the `tail' term, which has not been explicitly noted\nbefore in the literature.

This\nanalysis allows us to determine the singularity structure after null geodesics\nhave crossed an arbitrary number of caustics, although it raises a causality\nissue which the Kirchhoff integral method resolves. Because of the similarity\nin the caustic structure of the spacetimes, we expect our main results for wave\npropagation to also be valid on Schwarzschild spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 13:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 19:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

For flat-spectrum sources the median\n(mean) fractional polarization increases from 1.5% (2-2.5%) at 1.4GHz to 2.5-3%\n(3-3.5%) at \\nu>10GHz. Steep-spectrum sources are typically more polarized,\nespecially at high frequencies where Faraday depolarization is less relevant.\nAs a general result, we do not find that the fractional polarization of ERS\ndepends on the total flux density at high radio frequencies, i.e >20GHz.\nMoreover, in this frequency range, current data suggest a moderate increase of\nthe fractional polarization of ERS with frequency. A formalism to estimate ERS\nnumber counts in polarization and the contribution of unresolved polarized ERS\nto angular power spectra at Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frequencies is\nalso developed and discussed.

We extend previous work\non radial profiles by a pixel-to pixel analysis looking for asymmetries due to\nenvironmental interactions. The star formation rate is derived from GALEX UV\nand Spitzer total infrared data. As in field galaxies, the star formation rate\nfor most Virgo galaxies is approximately proportional to the molecular gas\nmass. Except for NGC 4438, the cluster environment does not affect the star\nformation efficiency with respect to the molecular gas. Gas truncation is not\nassociated with major changes in the total gas surface density distribution of\nthe inner disk of Virgo spiral galaxies. In three galaxies, possible increases\nin the molecular fraction and the star formation efficiency with respect to the\ntotal gas, of factors of 1.5 to 2, are observed on the windward side of the\ngalactic disk. A significant increase of the star formation efficiency with\nrespect to the molecular gas content on the windward side of ram\npressure-stripped galaxies is not observed. The ram-pressure stripped\nextraplanar gas of 3 highly inclined spiral galaxies shows a depressed star\nformation efficiency with respect to the total gas, and one of them (NGC 4438)\nshows a depressed rate even with respect to the molecular gas. The\ninterpretation is that stripped gas loses the gravitational confinement and\nassociated pressure of the galactic disk, and the gas flow is diverging, so the\ngas density decreases and the star formation rate drops. However, the stripped\nextraplanar gas in one highly inclined galaxy (NGC 4569) shows a normal star\nformation efficiency with respect to the total gas. We propose this galaxy is\ndifferent because it is observed long after peak pressure, and its extraplanar\ngas is now in a converging flow as it resettles back into the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 15:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

A practical scheme must offer high tolerance to errors while\nrequiring only simple (i.e. few-qubit) nodes. Here we show that relatively\nmodest, three-qubit nodes can support advanced purification techniques and so\noffer robust scalability: the infidelity in the entanglement channel may be\npermitted to approach 10% if the infidelity in local operations is of order\n0.1%. Our tolerance of network noise is therefore a order of magnitude beyond\nprior schemes, and our architecture remains robust even in the presence of\nconsiderable decoherence rates (memory errors). We compare the performance with\nthat of schemes involving nodes of lower and higher complexity. Ion traps, and\nNV- centres in diamond, are two highly relevant emerging technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 15:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 May 2012 14:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The thin films have been characterized\nbefore and after sorption/desorption processes of NO2 by energy-dispersive\nX-ray spectroscopy (EDS), grazing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD), Raman\nspectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atom force microscopy\n(AFM) measurements. These studies indicated that physisorption occurs when NO2\ngas molecules are introduced into the chalcogenide film and the thin film\ncomposition or structure do not change. The mass loading due to NO2 gas\nsorption was calculated by the resonator's frequency shift. At the conditions\nof our experiment, up to 6.8 ng of the gas was sorbed into 200nm thick Ge33Se67\nfilm at 5000 ppm NO2 concentration. It has been established that the process of\ngas molecules sorption is reversible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2012 15:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Sep 2012 21:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}
