On temporal networks a vertex is active\nonly at certain moments and inactive otherwise such that a contact is not\ncontinuously available. In several empirical networks, the time between two\nconsecutive vertex-activation events typically follows heterogeneous activity\n(e.g. bursts). In this chapter, we present a simple and intuitive stochastic\nmodel of a temporal network and investigate how epidemics co-evolves with the\ntemporal structures, focusing on the growth dynamics of the epidemics. The\nmodel assumes no underlying topological structure and is only constrained by\nthe time between two consecutive events of vertex activation.

In comparison to the homogeneous scenario, the\npower law case results in a faster growth in the beginning but turns out to be\nslower after a certain time, taking several time steps to reach the whole\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 16:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-25"}

We introduce a simplified model of magnetic\nflux pumping in an upper layer (the convection zone), and study the effects of\nits inclusion on the evolution of buoyancy instabilities in a lower layer (the\nradiative interior). We study its effects on the instability of both a\npreconceived magnetic slab and of a shear-generated magnetic layer. In the\nformer, we find that in the regime in which the downward pumping velocity is\ncomparable with the Alfven speed of the magnetic layer, flux pumping is able to\nhold back the bulk of the magnetic field, with only small pockets of strong\nfield able to rise into the upper layer. In simulations in which the magnetic\nlayer is generated by shear, we find that the shear velocity is not necessarily\nrequired to exceed that of the pumping (therefore the kinetic energy of the\nshear is not required to exceed that of the overlying convection), for strong\nlocalised pockets of magnetic field to be produced which can rise into the\nupper layer. This is because magnetic flux pumping acts to store the field\nbelow the interface, allowing it to be amplified both by the shear, and by\nvortical fluid motions, until pockets of field can achieve sufficient strength\nto rise into the upper layer. In addition, we find that the interface between\nthe two layers is a natural location for the production of strong vertical\ngradients in the magnetic field. If these gradients are sufficiently strong to\nallow the development of magnetic buoyancy instabilities, strong shear is not\nnecessarily required to drive them (c.f. previous work by Vasil & Brummell).

Several recent studies\nargue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible\nbifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models. However, a broader\ndefinition of a `tipping point' also includes other abrupt, non-linear changes\nthat are neither bifurcations nor necessarily irreversible. Examination of\nsatellite data for Arctic sea-ice area reveals an abrupt increase in the\namplitude of seasonal variability in 2007 that has persisted since then. We\nidentified this abrupt transition using recently developed methods that can\ndetect multi-modality in time-series data and sometimes forewarn of\nbifurcations. When removing the mean seasonal cycle (up to 2008) from the\nsatellite data, the residual sea-ice fluctuations switch from uni-modal to\nmulti-modal behaviour around 2007. We originally interpreted this as a\nbifurcation in which a new lower ice cover attractor appears in deseasonalised\nfluctuations and is sampled in every summer-autumn from 2007 onwards. However,\nthis interpretation is clearly sensitive to how the seasonal cycle is removed\nfrom the raw data, and to the presence of continental land masses restricting\nwinter-spring ice fluctuations. Furthermore, there was no robust early warning\nsignal of critical slowing down prior to the hypothesized bifurcation. Early\nwarning indicators do however show destabilization of the summer-autumn sea-ice\ncover since 2007. Thus, the bifurcation hypothesis lacks consistent support,\nbut there was an abrupt and persistent increase in the amplitude of the\nseasonal cycle of Arctic sea-ice cover in 2007, which we describe as a\n(non-bifurcation) `tipping point'. Our statistical methods detect this `tipping\npoint' and its time of onset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 17:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 11:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-23"}

As such, verifying the integrity of Internet-based searches over\nvast amounts of web contents is essential.\n  We provide the first solution to this general security problem. We introduce\nthe concept of an authenticated web crawler and present the design and\nprototype implementation of this new concept. An authenticated web crawler is a\ntrusted program that computes a special \"signature\" $s$ of a collection of web\ncontents it visits. Subject to this signature, web searches can be verified to\nbe correct with respect to the integrity of their produced results. This\nsignature also allows the verification of complicated queries on web pages,\nsuch as conjunctive keyword searches. In our solution, along with the web pages\nthat satisfy any given search query, the search engine also returns a\ncryptographic proof. This proof, together with the signature $s$, enables any\nuser to efficiently verify that no legitimate web pages are omitted from the\nresult computed by the search engine, and that no pages that are non-conforming\nwith the query are included in the result. An important property of our\nsolution is that the proof size and the verification time both depend solely on\nthe sizes of the query description and the query result, but not on the number\nor sizes of the web pages over which the search is performed.\n  Our authentication protocols are based on standard Merkle trees and the more\ninvolved bilinear-map accumulators.

We present a\nsimpler combinatorial algorithm which has nearly the same time-approximation\ntradeoff as the algorithm of Cygan et al., and which lends itself naturally to\na lift-and-project based approach.\n  At a high level, our approach is similar to the recent work of Karlin,\nMathieu, and Nguyen [IPCO 2011], who examined a known PTAS for Knapsack\n(similar to our combinatorial Set-Cover algorithm) and its connection to\nhierarchies of LP and SDP relaxations for Knapsack. For Set-Cover, we show\nthat, indeed, using the trick of \"lifting the objective function\", we can match\nthe performance of our combinatorial algorithm using the LP hierarchy of Lovasz\nand Schrijver. We also show that this trick is essential: even in the stronger\nLP hierarchy of Sherali and Adams, the integrality gap remains at least (1-eps)\nln(n) at level Omega(n) (when the objective function is not lifted).\n  As shown by Aleknovich, Arora, and Tourlakis [STOC 2005], Set-Cover\nrelaxations stemming from SDP hierarchies (specifically, LS+) have similarly\nlarge integrality gaps. This stands in contrast to Knapsack, where Karlin et\nal. showed that the (much stronger) Lasserre SDP hierarchy reduces the\nintegrality gap to (1+eps) at level O(1). For completeness, we show that LS+\nalso reduces the integrality gap for Knapsack to (1+eps). This result may be of\nindependent interest, as our LS+ based rounding and analysis are rather\ndifferent from those of Karlin et al., and to the best of our knowledge this is\nthe first explicit demonstration of such a reduction in the integrality gap of\nLS+ relaxations after few rounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 20:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 13:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-26"}

Next we exhibit an oracle $\\alpha$ that\nmakes $\\ACk(\\alpha)$ a proper hierarchy. This strengthens and clarifies the\nseparations of the relativized theories in [Takeuti, 1995]. The idea is that a\ncircuit whose nested depth of oracle gates is bounded by $k$ cannot compute\ncorrectly the $(k+1)$ compositions of every oracle function. Finally we develop\ntheories that characterize the relativizations of subclasses of \\Ptime\\ by\nmodifying theories previously defined by the second two authors. A function is\nprovably total in a theory iff it is in the corresponding relativized class,\nand hence the oracle separations imply separations for the relativized\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 22:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}

In this\npaper we study the design of optimal mechanisms for a monopolistic data\nprovider to sell information to a buyer, in a model where both parties have\n(possibly correlated) private signals about a state of the world, and the buyer\nuses information learned from the seller, along with his own signal, to choose\nan action (e.g., displaying an ad) whose payoff depends on the state of the\nworld.\n  We provide sufficient conditions under which there is a simple one-round\nprotocol (i.e. a protocol where the buyer and seller each sends a single\nmessage, and there is a single money transfer) achieving optimal revenue. In\nthese cases we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes the optimal\nmechanism. Intriguingly, we show that multiple rounds of partial information\ndisclosure (interleaved by payment to the seller) are sometimes necessary to\nachieve optimal revenue if the buyer is allowed to abort his interaction with\nthe seller prematurely.

The observed\nSEDs of BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) are fitted well with the synchrotron +\nsynchrotron-self-Compton (syn+SSC) model, whereas the SEDs of the two flat\nspectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) need to include the contributions of external\nCompton scattering. In this scenario, it is found that the Doppler factor delta\nof FSRQs is smaller than that of BL Lacs, but the magnetic field strength B of\nFSRQs is larger than that of BL Lacs. The increase of the peak frequency of the\nSEDs is accompanied with the increase of the flux for the individual sources,\nwhich seems opposite to the observational phenomena of the blazar sequence.

However, the consequences of such changes on the\ndistribution of an ego's network ties are not well understood. Here we use a\nunique 18-month data set that combines mobile phone calls and survey data to\ntrack changes in the ego networks and communication patterns of students making\nthe transition from school to university or work. Our analysis reveals that\nindividuals display a distinctive and robust social signature, captured by how\ninteractions are distributed across different alters. Notably, for a given ego,\nthese social signatures tend to persist over time, despite considerable\nturnover in the identity of alters in the ego network. Thus as new network\nmembers are added, some old network members are either replaced or receive\nfewer calls, preserving the overall distribution of calls across network\nmembers. This is likely to reflect the consequences of finite resources such as\nthe time available for communication, the cognitive and emotional effort\nrequired to sustain close relationships, and the ability to make emotional\ninvestments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 09:45:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2013 08:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

Handling of the infinite state spaces of timed\nsystem in the extended IC3 algorithm is based on suitably adapting the\nwell-known region abstraction for timed systems.

These results may indicate a fundamental role of\nsampling effects on scales that are typically only a few times larger than\nthose of the largest molecular clouds. To investigate the impact of this\neffect, we construct simple models for the distribution of molecular clouds in\na typical star-forming spiral galaxy, and, assuming a power-law relation\nbetween SFR and cloud mass, explore a range of input parameters. We confirm\nthat the slope and the scatter of the simulated SFR-molecular gas surface\ndensity relation depend on the size of the sub-galactic region considered, due\nto stochastic sampling of the molecular cloud mass function, and the effect is\nlarger for steeper relations between SFR and molecular gas. There is a general\ntrend for all slope values to tend to ~unity for region sizes larger than 1-2\nkpc, irrespective of the input SFR-cloud relation. The region size of 1-2 kpc\ncorresponds to the area where the cloud mass function becomes fully sampled. We\nquantify the effects of selection biases in data tracing the SFR, either as\nthresholds (i.e., clouds smaller than a given mass value do not form stars) or\nbackgrounds (e.g., diffuse emission unrelated to current star formation is\ncounted towards the SFR). Apparently discordant observational results are\nbrought into agreement via this simple model, and the comparison of our\nsimulations with data for a few galaxies supports a steep (>1) power law index\nbetween SFR and molecular gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 13:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this relaxed version, loosely speaking, the algorithm is allowed to\nreplace the constraints of an instance by some other (possibly real-valued)\nconstraints, and then only needs to satisfy as many of the new constraints as\npossible.\n  To be more precise, we introduce the following notion of a predicate $P$\nbeing \\emph{useful} for a (real-valued) objective $Q$: given an almost\nsatisfiable Max-$P$ instance, there is an algorithm that beats a random\nassignment on the corresponding Max-$Q$ instance applied to the same sets of\nliterals. The standard notion of a nontrivial approximation algorithm for a\nMax-CSP with predicate $P$ is exactly the same as saying that $P$ is useful for\n$P$ itself.\n  We say that $P$ is useless if it is not useful for any $Q$. This turns out to\nbe equivalent to the following pseudo-randomness property: given an almost\nsatisfiable instance of Max-$P$ it is hard to find an assignment such that the\ninduced distribution on $k$-bit strings defined by the instance is not\nessentially uniform.\n  Under the Unique Games Conjecture, we give a complete and simple\ncharacterization of useful Max-CSPs defined by a predicate: such a Max-CSP is\nuseless if and only if there is a pairwise independent distribution supported\non the satisfying assignments of the predicate. It is natural to also consider\nthe case when no negations are allowed in the CSP instance, and we derive a\nsimilar complete characterization (under the UGC) there as well.\n  Finally, we also include some results and examples shedding additional light\non the approximability of certain Max-CSPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 14:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}

These models are the\none-dimensional limit of two dimensional Chern Insulators, and the Hubbard-type\ninteractions projected into their lowest band take particularly simple forms.\nBy exactly solving the many-body interacting spectrum of these models, we show\nthat, just like in the Fractional Quantum Hall effect, the zero modes of the\nthin-torus limit are CDW states of occupation numbers satisfying generalized\nPauli principles. As opposed to the FQH where the thin-torus CDW appear in\norbital space, in the thin-torus FCI states, the CDW states are in real-space.\nWe show the counting of the quasihole excitations in the energy spectrum cannot\ndistinguish between a CDW state and a FQH state. However, by exactly computing\nthe entanglement spectrum for the thin-torus states, we show that it can\nqualitatively and quantitatively distinguish between a CDW and a fractional\ntopological state such as the FCI. We then discover a previously unknown\nseparation of energy scales of the full FQH energy spectrum in the thin torus\nlimit and find that Chern insulator models exhibiting strong isotropic FCI\nstates have a similar structure in their thin-torus limit spectrum. We close by\nnumerically computing the evolution of energy and entanglement spectra from the\nthin-torus to the isotropic limit.

This\ngives rise to the inequality $N^{2 - r} \\le (1/3){(2/3)}^{r - 1}$, which is\ntrue for all $r$, where $r = \\omega(N)$ is the number of distinct prime factors\nof $N$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Apr 2012 13:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 23:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-17"}
