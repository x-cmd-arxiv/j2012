The\nlinearization of the dynamics is given by the Laplace-Beltrami operator plus a\ntransport term (which can be suppressed by introducing appropriate weights into\nthe function space norm), plus a finite-depth potential well with a universal\nprofile.

Among them, incremental sampling-based motion\nplanning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs), and the\nProbabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) have become very popular recently, owing to\ntheir implementation simplicity and their advantages in handling\nhigh-dimensional problems. Although these algorithms work very well in\npractice, the quality of the computed solution is often not good, i.e., the\nsolution can be far from the optimal one. A recent variation of RRT, namely the\nRRT* algorithm, bypasses this drawback of the traditional RRT algorithm, by\nensuring asymptotic optimality as the number of samples tends to infinity.\nNonetheless, the convergence rate to the optimal solution may still be slow.\nThis paper presents a new incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithm\nbased on Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRG), denoted RRT# (RRT \"sharp\")\nwhich also guarantees asymptotic optimality but, in addition, it also ensures\nthat the constructed spanning tree of the geometric graph is consistent after\neach iteration. In consistent trees, the vertices which have the potential to\nbe part of the optimal solution have the minimum cost-come-value. This implies\nthat the best possible solution is readily computed if there are some vertices\nin the current graph that are already in the goal region.

It is therefore important to be\nable to make fair decisions in this large-scale and highly competitive\neconomical ecosystem. One of the main issues is to prevent actors from\nmanipulating the natural outcome of the decision process. For that purpose,\ngame theory is a natural framework. In that context, voting systems represent\nan interesting alternative that, to our knowledge, has not yet been considered.\nThey allow competing entities to decide among different options. Strong\ntheoretical results showed that all voting systems are susceptible to be\nmanipulated by one single voter, except for some \"degenerated\" and\nnon-acceptable cases. However, very little is known about how much a voting\nsystem is manipulable in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate\nempirically the use of voting systems for choosing end-to-end paths in\nmulti-carrier networks, analyzing their manipulability and their economical\nefficiency. We show that one particular system, called \\Single Transferable\nVote (STV), is largely more resistant to manipulability than the natural system\nwhich tries to get the economical optimum. Moreover, STV manages to select\npaths close to the economical optimum, whether the participants try to cheat or\nnot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Apr 2012 05:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-01"}

In real images, the full\ngradients of the edge indicator function along the object boundaries are often\nsmall. Hence, the curve evolution of edge-based active contours can terminate\nearly before converging to the object boundaries with a careless contour\ninitialization. We propose a novel Geodesic Snakes (GeoSnakes) active contour\nthat requires the full gradients of the edge indicator to vanish at the optimal\nsolution. Besides, the conventional curve evolution approach for minimizing\nactive contour energy cannot fully solve the Euler-Lagrange (EL) equation of\nour GeoSnakes active contour, causing a Pseudo Stationary Phenomenon (PSP).

The main\nidea is to replace its permutation matrix by adding to it a rank 1 matrix. The\nmotivation for this change is twofold: it would allow the use of codes that\nwere shown to be insecure in the original McEliece's cryptosystem, and it would\nreduce the key size while keeping the same security against generic decoding\nattacks. The authors suggest to use generalized Reed-Solomon codes instead of\nGoppa codes. The public code built with this method is not anymore a\ngeneralized Reed-Solomon code. On the other hand, it contains a very large\nsecret generalized Reed-Solomon code. In this paper we present an attack that\nis built upon a distinguisher which is able to identify elements of this secret\ncode. The distinguisher is constructed by considering the code generated by\ncomponent-wise products of codewords of the public code (the so-called \"square\ncode\").

Such bounded rational decision-makers can be\nthought of as thermodynamic machines that undergo physical state changes when\nthey compute. Their behavior is governed by a free energy functional that\ntrades off changes in internal energy-as a proxy for utility-and entropic\nchanges representing computational costs induced by changing states. As a\nresult, the bounded rational decision-making problem can be rephrased in terms\nof well-known concepts from statistical physics. In the limit when\ncomputational costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is\nrecovered.

The\nexponential probability distribution of wages, predicted by the statistical\nequilibrium theory of a labor market developed by Foley in 1996, is supported\nby empirical data on income distribution in the USA for the majority (about\n97%) of population.

The factor graph describes the instance up to the polarity of the\nvariables, and hence there are up to 2km instances of the CSP that share the\nsame factor graph. It is well known that factor graphs with certain structural\nproperties make the underlying CSP easier to either solve exactly (e.g., for\ntree structures) or approximately (e.g., for planar structures). We are\ninterested in the following question: is there a factor graph for which if one\ncan solve every instance of the CSP with this particular factor graph, then one\ncan solve every instance of the CSP regardless of the factor graph (and\nsimilarly, for approximation)? We call such a factor graph universal. As one\nneeds different factor graphs for different values of n and m, this gives rise\nto the notion of a family of universal factor graphs.
