More recently, the EnKF has proven effective in history matching in the\npetroleum engineering community (Evensen, 2009; Oliver and Chen, 2010). Such\napplications typically involve estimating large numbers of parameters,\ndescribing an oil reservoir, using data from production history that accumulate\nover time. Such history matching problems are especially challenging examples\nof computer model calibration since they involve a large number of model\nparameters as well as a computationally demanding forward model. More\ngenerally, computer model calibration combines physical observations with a\ncomputational model - a computer model - to estimate unknown parameters in the\ncomputer model. This paper explores how the EnKF can be used in computer model\ncalibration problems, comparing it to other more common approaches, considering\napplications in climate and cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 16:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2012 23:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-25"}

The interpretation of the highly\ndamped QNM frequencies in the multi-horizon case is based on the similar\ngrounds as in the single horizon (Schwarzschild) case, but it has some new\nfeatures that are discussed in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 16:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2012 20:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-06-21"}

The T^2\nbehavior is guaranteed only if Umklapp processes are allowed; however, if the\nFermi surface (FS) is small or the electron-electron interaction is of a very\nlong range, Umklapps are suppressed. In this case, a T^2 term can result only\nfrom a combined--but distinct from quantum-interference corrections-- effect of\nthe electron-impurity and \\emph{ee} interactions. Whether the T^2 term is\npresent depends on 1) dimensionality (two dimensions (2D) vs three dimensions\n(3D)), 2) topology (simply- vs multiply-connected), and 3) shape (convex vs\nconcave) of the FS. In particular, the T^2 term is absent for any quadratic\n(but not necessarily isotropic) spectrum both in 2D and 3D. The T^2 term is\nalso absent for a convex and simply-connected but otherwise arbitrarily\nanisotropic FS in 2D. The origin of this nullification is approximate\nintegrability of the electron motion on a 2D FS, where the energy and momentum\nconservation laws do not allow for current relaxation to leading\n--second--order in T/E_F (E_F is the Fermi energy). If the T^2 term is\nnullified by the conservation law, the first non-zero term behaves as T^4. The\nsame applies to a quantum-critical metal in the vicinity of a Pomeranchuk\ninstability, with a proviso that the leading (first non-zero) term in the\nresistivity scales as T^{\\frac{D+2}{3}} (T^{\\frac{D+8}{3}}).

In many clinical applications, it is more\npreferable to reconstruct true 4DCBCT with the 4th dimension being time, i.e.,\neach CBCT image is reconstructed based on the corresponding instantaneous\nprojection. We propose in this work a novel algorithm for the reconstruction of\nthis truly time-resolved CBCT, called cine-CBCT, by effectively utilizing the\nunderlying temporal coherence, such as periodicity or repetition, in those\ncine-CBCT images. Assuming each column of the matrix $\\bm{U}$ represents a CBCT\nimage to be reconstructed and the total number of columns is the same as the\nnumber of projections, the central idea of our algorithm is that the rank of\n$\\bm{U}$ is much smaller than the number of projections and we can use a matrix\nfactorization form $\\bm{U}=\\bm{L}\\bm{R}$ for $\\bm{U}$. The number of columns\nfor the matrix $\\bm{L}$ constraints the rank of $\\bm{U}$ and hence implicitly\nimposing a temporal coherence condition among all the images in cine-CBCT. The\ndesired image properties in $\\bm{L}$ and the periodicity of the breathing\npattern are achieved by penalizing the sparsity of the tight wavelet frame\ntransform of $\\bm{L}$ and that of the Fourier transform of $\\bm{R}$,\nrespectively.

In addition, we find that the characteristic value SFR* from the\nSchechter fit to SFR function exhibits consistent, and substantial, linear\ngrowth as a function of redshift from ~5 M_sun/yr at z~8, 650 Myr after the Big\nBang, to ~100 M_sun/yr at z~2, ~2.5 Gyr later. Recent results at z~10, close to\nthe onset of galaxy formation, are consistent with this trend. The uniformity\nof this evolution is even greater than seen in the UV LF over the redshift\nrange z~2-8, providing validation for our dust corrections. These results\nprovide strong evidence that galaxies build up uniformly over the first 3 Gyr\nof cosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2012 16:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Previous attempts to find O-type stars that\nformed in isolation were hindered by the possibility that such stars are merely\nrunaways from clusters, i.e., their current isolation does not reflect their\nbirth conditions. We introduce a new method to find O-type stars that are not\naffected by such a degeneracy. Using the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey and\nadditional high resolution imaging we have identified stars that satisfy the\nfollowing constraints: 1) they are O-type stars that are not detected to be\npart of a binary system based on RV time series analysis; 2) they are\ndesignated spectral type O7 or earlier ; 3) their velocities are within 1\\sigma\nof the mean of OB-type stars in the 30 Doradus region, i.e. they are not\nrunaways along our line-of-sight; 4) the projected surface density of stars\ndoes not increase within 3 pc towards the O-star (no evidence for clusters); 5)\ntheir sight lines are associated with gaseous and/or dusty filaments in the\nISM, and 6) if a second candidate is found in the direction of the same\nfilament with which the target is associated, both are required to have similar\nvelocities. With these criteria, we have identified 15 stars in the 30 Doradus\nregion, which are strong candidates for being high-mass stars that have formed\nin isolation. Additionally, we employed extensive MC stellar cluster\nsimulations to confirm that our results rule out the presence of clusters\naround the candidates. Eleven of these are classified as Vz stars, possibly\nassociated with the zero-age main sequence. We include a newly discovered W-R\nstar as a candidate, although it does not meet all of the above criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 09:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Along the path of\nnon-asymptotic analysis, in this paper, it is further shown that jar decoding\nis actually optimal up to the second order coding performance by establishing\nnew non-asymptotic converse coding theorems, and determining the Taylor\nexpansion of the (best) coding rate $R_n (\\epsilon)$ of finite block length for\nany block length $n$ and word error probability $\\epsilon$ up to the second\norder. Finally, based on the Taylor-type expansion and the new converses, two\napproximation formulas for $R_n (\\epsilon)$ (dubbed \"SO\" and \"NEP\") are\nprovided; they are further evaluated and compared against some of the best\nbounds known so far, as well as the normal approximation of $R_n (\\epsilon)$\nrevisited recently in the literature. It turns out that while the normal\napproximation is all over the map, i.e. sometime below achievable bounds and\nsometime above converse bounds, the SO approximation is much more reliable as\nit is always below converses; in the meantime, the NEP approximation is the\nbest among the three and always provides an accurate estimation for $R_n\n(\\epsilon)$. An important implication arising from the Taylor-type expansion of\n$R_n (\\epsilon)$ is that in the practical non-asymptotic regime, the optimal\nmarginal codeword symbol distribution is not necessarily a capacity achieving\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2012 21:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-18"}

Since the electron-positron pairing\nmechanism leading to the breaking of the chiral symmetry is mainly dominated by\nthe contributions from the infrared region of momenta much smaller than\n$\\sqrt{eH}$, the magnetic field introduces a dynamical ultraviolet cutoff in\nthe theory that also enters in the non-perturbative Euler-Heisenberg action.\nUsing this action, we show that the system exhibits a significant\nparaelectricity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. The\nnonperturbative nature of this effect is reflected in the non-analytic\ndependence of the obtained electric susceptibility on the fine-structure\nconstant. The strong paraelectricity in the field direction is linked to the\norientation of the electric dipole moments of the pairs that form the chiral\ncondensate.

State of the art approaches for handling\ninconsistent data are systems that learn and use conditional functional\ndependencies (CFDs) to rectify data.

While getting a clean training sample is feasible in\nenterprise data scenarios, it is infeasible in web databases where there is no\nseparate curated data. CFD based methods are unfortunately particularly\nsensitive to noise; we will empirically demonstrate that the number of CFDs\nlearned falls quite drastically with even a small amount of noise. In order to\novercome this limitation, we propose a fully probabilistic framework for\ncleaning data. Our approach involves learning both the generative and error\n(corruption) models of the data and using them to clean the data. For\ngenerative models, we learn Bayes networks from the data.

The relative strength of the center and surround determine the\nspecific computation achieved. For example, weak surrounds achieve low-pass\nspatial frequency filtering and are optimal for denoising when signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) is low. Balanced surrounds achieve band-pass spatial frequency\nfiltering and are optimal for decorrelation of responses when SNR is high.\nSurround strength has been measured in the retina and dorsal Lateral Geniculate\nNucleus (dLGN), primarily in anesthetized or ex vivo preparations. Here we\nrevisit the center-surround architecture of dLGN neurons in the un-anesthetized\nrat. We report the spatial frequency tuning responses of N=47 neurons. We fit\nthese tuning curves to a difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) model of the spatial\nreceptive field. We find that some dLGN neurons in the awake rat (N=8/47) have\nweak surrounds. The majority of cells in our sample (N=29/47), however, have\nwell-balanced center and surround strengths and band-pass tuning curves. We\nalso observed several neurons (N=10/47) with notched or dual-band-pass tuning\ncurves, a response class that has not been described previously. Within the\nspace of circularly concentric DOG models, strong surrounds were necessary and\nsufficient to explain the dual-band-pass spatial frequency tuning of these\ncells. It remains to be determined what advantage if any is conferred by this\nnovel response class, or by the heterogeneity of surround strength as such.

This enhancement of magnetic excitations is\nalso manifested in the electronic spectral function, where a pseudogap can open\nat the hot spots of the Fermi surface. In the nematic phase, electrons are\nscattered by magnetic fluctuations that are anisotropic in momentum space,\ngiving rise to a non-zero resistivity anisotropy whose sign changes between\nelectron-doped and hole-doped compounds. We also show that due to the\nmagneto-elastic coupling, nematic fluctuations soften the shear modulus in the\nnormal state, but harden it in the superconducting state. The latter effect is\nan indirect consequence of the competition between magnetism and\nsuperconductivity, and also causes a suppression of the orthorhombic distortion\nbelow T_{c}. We also demonstrate that ferro-orbital fluctuations enhance the\nnematic susceptibility, cooperatively promoting an electronic tetragonal\nsymmetry-breaking. Finally, we argue that T_{c} in the iron pnictides might be\nenhanced due to nematic fluctuations of magnetic origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 03:43:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 02:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Jun 2012 16:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-18"}

The level density of many-body\nstates increases exponentially with the number of excited electrons. When the\nresidual electron-electron interaction exceeds the interval between these\nlevels, the eigenstates (called compound states or compound resonances if these\nstates are in the continuum) become \"chaotic\" superpositions of large numbers\nof Hartree-Fock configurational basis states. This situation takes place in\nsome rare-earth atoms and many open-shell multiply charged ions excited in the\nprocess of electron recombination.

The result is a radiative capture cross section averaged over a\nsmall energy interval containing several compound resonances. In many cases\nindividual resonances are not resolved experimentally (since the interval\nbetween them is small, e.g., $\\le 1$ meV, possibly even smaller than their\nradiative widths), therefore, our statistical theory should correctly describe\nthe experimental data.

OH(6049\nMHz) masers have therefore been proposed as a complementary indicator of\nremnant-cloud interaction.\n  This motivated searches for 6049 MHz maser emission from supernova remnants\nusing the Parkes 63 m and Effelsberg 100 m telescopes, and the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array. A total of forty-one remnants have been examined by\none or more of these surveys, but without success. To check the accuracy of the\nOH column densities inferred from the single-dish observations we modelled OH\nabsorption at 1667 MHz observed with the Very Large Array towards three\nsupernova remnants, IC 443, W44 and 3C 391. The results are mixed -- the OH\ncolumn is revised upwards in IC443, downwards in 3C391, and is somewhat reduced\nin W44. We conclude that OH columns exceeding 10^{17} cm^{-2} are indeed\npresent in some supernova remnants and so the lack of any detections is not\nexplained by low OH column density. We discuss the possibility that non-local\nline overlap is responsible for suppressing the inversion of the 6049 MHz line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 09:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Besides, we perform a\none-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of the longitudinal oscillations. The\nhigh-resolution observations by Hinode/SOT indicate that the prominence, seen\nas a concave-inward shape in lower-resolution Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images,\nactually consists of many concave-outward threads, which is indicative of the\nexistence of magnetic dips. After being injected into the dip region, a bulk of\nprominence material started to oscillate for more than 3.5 hours, with the\nperiod being 52 min. The oscillation decayed with time, with the decay\ntimescale being 133 min. Our hydrodynamic simulation can well reproduce the\noscillation period, but the damping timescale in the simulation is 1.5 times as\nlong as the observations. The results clearly show the prominence longitudinal\noscillations around the dip of the prominence and our study suggests that the\nrestoring force of the longitudinal oscillations might be the gravity.\nRadiation and heat conduction are insufficient to explain the decay of the\noscillations. Other mechanisms, such as wave leakage and mass accretion, have\nto be considered.

The paper analyses the stages in the\nevolution of early writing systems which began with the evolution of counting\nin the ancient Near East. A stage anterior to the stage of syllabic\nrepresentation of sounds of a language, is identified. Unique geometric shapes\nrequired for tokens to categorize objects became too large to handle to\nabstract hundreds of categories of goods and metallurgical processes during the\nproduction of bronze-age goods. About 3500 BCE, Indus script as a writing\nsystem was developed to use hieroglyphs to represent the 'spoken words'\nidentifying each of the goods and processes. A rebus method of representing\nsimilar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indus\nscript. This method is recognized and consistently applied for the lingua\nfranca of the Indian sprachbund. That the ancient languages of India,\nconstituted a sprachbund (or language union) is now recognized by many\nlinguists. The sprachbund area is proximate to the area where most of the Indus\nscript inscriptions were discovered, as documented in the corpora. That\nhundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidenced\nby their use on early punch-marked coins. This explains the combined use of\nsyllabic scripts such as Brahmi and Kharoshti together with the hieroglyphs on\nRampurva copper bolt, and Sohgaura copper plate from about 6th century\nBCE.Indian hieroglyphs constitute a writing system for meluhha language and are\nrebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy lexemes.

Some of the implications of these results in the study of high-mass\nstar formation are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 14:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-18"}

A simple drag\nmodel is used to analytically construct time-elongation profiles which are then\nfitted with the two methods. It is found that higher angles and velocities give\nrise to greater error in both methods, reaching errors in the direction of\npropagation of up to 15 deg and 30 deg for the F\\Phi and HM fitting methods,\nrespectively. This is due to the physical accelerations of the CMEs being\ninterpreted as geometrical accelerations by the fitting methods.

In addition, we assume a\npractical on-off transmitter model with non-ideal circuit power, i.e., when the\ntransmitter is on, its consumed power is the sum of the transmit power and a\nconstant circuit power. Under this setup, we study the optimal transmit power\nallocation to maximize the average throughput over a finite horizon, subject to\nthe time-varying energy constraint and the non-ideal circuit power consumption.\nFirst, we consider the off-line optimization under the assumption that the\nenergy arrival time and amount are a priori known at the transmitter. Although\nthis problem is non-convex due to the non-ideal circuit power, we show an\nefficient optimal solution that in general corresponds to a two-phase\ntransmission: the first phase with an EE-maximizing on-off power allocation,\nand the second phase with a SE-maximizing power allocation that is\nnon-decreasing over time, thus revealing an interesting result that both the EE\nand SE optimizations are unified in an energy harvesting communication system.\nWe then extend the optimal off-line algorithm to the case with multiple\nparallel AWGN channels, based on the principle of nested optimization.
