We consider two extreme cases of clock models,\nnamely Ising-like and U(1)-symmetric ones, and find the critical exponents\nusing Monte Carlo methods. The dynamical critical exponent and the anomalous\nscaling dimension $\\eta$ are independent of the order parameter symmetry for\nall values of $s$. The dynamical critical exponent varies continuously from $z\n\\approx 2$ for $s=1$ to $z=1$ for $s=2$, and the anomalous scaling dimension\nevolves correspondingly from $\\eta \\gtrsim 0$ to $\\eta = 1/4$.

It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and\nintense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus\nmaking the outflows momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the\nenergy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor\n~v_in/2v_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v_s is the velocity of\nthe swept-up material. Energy-conserving outflows driven by fast AGN winds\n(v_in~0.1c) may therefore explain the momentum fluxes Pdot>>L_AGN/c of\ngalaxy-scale outflows recently measured in luminous quasars and ULIRGs.

The derived results may\nbe reduced to non-magnetic junctions by setting the exchange field equal to\nzero. We find that increments of the magnetic barrier thickness may cause a\nreversal of the supercurrent direction flowing into some of the leads, whereas\nthe direction of current-flow remains invariant at the others. The reversal\ndirection can be switched by tuning the perpendicular superconducting phases.\nIn the non-magnetic case, we find that the supercurrent flowing between the\nleads in one direction can be tuned by changing the superconducting phase\ndifference in the perpendicular direction. These findings suggest the\npossibility of constructing a nano-scale superconducting phase transistor whose\ncore element consists of the proposed four-terminal Josephson junction with\nrich switching aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-23"}

We focus on the IGM close to the\ngalaxies as the detailed ionization distribution and velocity fields of this\nregion could significantly influence the scattering of Ly-alpha photons off\nneutral H atoms as they traverse the IGM after escaping from the galaxy. We\nsimulate the surface brightness (SB) maps and spectra of more than 100 LAEs at\nz=7.7 as seen by an observer at z=0. To achieve this, we extract the source\nproperties of galaxies and their surrounding IGM from cosmological simulations\nof box sizes 5-30 Mpc/h and follow the coupled radiative transfer of ionizing\nand Ly-alpha radiation through the IGM using CRASH-alpha. We find that the\nsimulated SB profiles are extended and their detailed structure is affected by\ninhomogeneities in the IGM, especially at high neutral fractions. The\ndetectability of LAEs and the fraction of the flux observed depend heavily on\nthe shape of the SB profile and the SB threshold (SB_th) of the observational\ncampaign. Only ultradeep observations (e.g. SB_th ~ 10^-23\nergs/s/cm^2/arcsec^2) would be able to obtain the true underlying\nmass-luminosity relation and luminosity functions of LAEs. The details of our\nresults depend on whether Ly-alpha photons are significantly shifted in the\ngalaxy to longer wavelengths, the mean ionization fraction in the IGM and the\nclustering of ionizing sources. These effects can lead to an easier escape of\nLy-alpha photons with less scattering in the IGM and a concentrated SB profile\nsimilar to the one of a point source. Finally, we show that the SB profiles are\nsteeper at high ionization fraction for the same LAE sample which can\npotentially be observed from the stacked profile of a large number of LAEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2012 06:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-30"}

Its geometrical content is exploited\nfully by implementing a Hamiltonian extension of it which is closer to\nGotay-Nester presymplectic constraint algorithm used to solve singular\nHamiltonian systems. Thus, given an optimal control problem whose optimal\nfeedback is given in implicit form, a consistent set of equations is obtained\ndescribing the first order differential conditions of Pontryaguine's Maximum\nPrinciple.

Gamma rays are not deflected by magnetic fields, have a luminosity up\nto ~1/3 that of the injected cosmic rays, and can easily penetrate column\ndepths of ~100 g/cm^2 before being attenuated by gamma-Z pair production. The\nionization rates of GRDRs, <~10^-16 s^-1, are much smaller than in cosmic ray\ndominated regions, but in the most extreme starbursts, they may still reach\nvalues comparable to those in Milky Way molecular clouds.

The abundances of SLRs in the gas\nof a star-forming galaxy are inversely proportional to the gas consumption\ntime. The rapid evolution of specific star formation rate (SSFR) of normal\ngalaxies implies they had mean SLR abundances ~3--10 times higher at z = 2.\nDuring the epoch of Solar system formation, the background SLR abundances of\nthe Galaxy were up to twice as high as at present, if SLR yields from massive\nstars do not depend on metallicity. If SLRs are homogenized in the gas of\ngalaxies, the high SSFRs of normal galaxies can partly explain the elevated\nabundance of SLRs like $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al in the early Solar system.\nStarburst galaxies have much higher SSFRs still, and have enormous mean\nabundances of $^{26}$Al ($^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ~ $10^{-3}$ for Solar metallicity\ngas). The main uncertainty is whether the SLRs are mixed with the star-forming\nmolecular gas: they could be trapped in hot gas and decay before entering the\ncolder phases, or be blown out by starburst winds. I consider how variability\nin star-formation rate affects the SLR abundances, and I discuss how SLR\ntransport may differ in these galaxies. The enhanced $^{26}$Al of starbursts\nmight maintain moderate ionization rates ($10^{-18}$ -- $10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$),\npossibly dominating ionization in dense clouds not penetrated by cosmic rays.\nSimilar ionization rates would be maintained in protoplanetary discs of\nstarbursts, if the SLRs are well-mixed, and the radiogenic heating of\nplanetesimals would likewise be much higher.

One important observational\nconstraint is the correlation between UV-optical colours and Mg2 line strengths\nfound by Burstein et al. (1988). The simplest interpretation of this phenomenon\nis that the UV strength is related to the Mg line strength. Under this\nassumption, we expect galaxies with larger Mg gradients to have larger UV\ncolour gradients. By combining UV imaging from GALEX, optical imaging from MDM\nand SAURON integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolved\nrelationships between UV colours and stellar population properties of 34\nearly-type galaxies from the SAURON survey sample. We find that galaxies with\nold stellar populations show tight correlations between the FUV colours (FUV-V\nand FUV-NUV) and the Mgb index, H{\\beta} index and metallicity [Z/H]. The\nequivalent correlations for the Fe5015 index, {\\alpha}-enhancement\n[{\\alpha}/Fe] and age are present but weaker. We have also derived logarithmic\ninternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar population\ngradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the FUV-V and\nFUV-NUV colour gradients on both the Mg b line strength and the metallicity\ngradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. In particular, global\ngradients of Mg b and [Z/H] with respect to the UV colour across galaxies are\nconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that the\nglobal correlations also hold locally. From a simple model based on multi-band\ncolour fits of UV upturn and UV-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausible\nrange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. In\nthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the UV flux is strong,\nare enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to UV-weak regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Apr 2012 23:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In this paper, we\npropose a new approach to couple generative and discriminative models in an\nunified framework based on PAC-Bayes risk theory. We first derive the\nmodel-parameter-independent stochastic feature mapping from a practical MAP\nclassifier operating on generative models. Then we construct a linear\nstochastic classifier equipped with the feature mapping, and derive the\nexplicit PAC-Bayes risk bounds for such classifier for both supervised and\nsemi-supervised learning. Minimizing the risk bound, using an EM-like iterative\nprocedure, results in a new posterior over hidden variables (E-step) and the\nupdate rules of model parameters (M-step). The derivation of the posterior is\nalways feasible due to the way of equipping feature mapping and the explicit\nform of bounding risk. The derived posterior allows the tuning of generative\nmodels and subsequently the feature mappings for better classification. The\nderived update rules of the model parameters are same to those of the uncoupled\nmodels as the feature mapping is model-parameter-independent.

We show that the PBG indeed\nplays an important role and its simultaneous presence could catalyze\nrealization of localized light even when strength of disorder is not\nsufficiently strong to independently cause localization of light.

They are likely the immediate precursors of planetary nebulae (PNe)\nwith close binary central. We have made a Monte Carlo simulation to determine\nthe fraction of red giant binaries that go through a common envelope (CE) event\nleading to the production of a close binary system or a merged star. The novel\naspect of this simulation is that we use the observed frequency of sequence E\nbinaries in the LMC to normalize our calculations. In our standard model, we\nfind that in the LMC today the fraction of PNe with close binary central stars\nis 7-9%, the fraction of PNe with intermediate period binary central stars\nhaving separations capable of influencing the nebula shape (P<500 yrs) is\n23-27%, the fraction of PNe containing wide binaries that are unable to\ninfluence the nebula shape (P>500 yrs) is 46-55%, the fraction of PNe derived\nfrom single stars is 3-19% and 5-6% of PNe are produced by previously merged\nstars. We also predict that the birthrate of post-RGB stars is ~4% of the total\nPN birthrate, equivalent to ~50% of the production rate of PNe with close\nbinary central stars. These post-RGB stars most likely appear initially as\nluminous low-mass helium white dwarf binaries. We use our model and the\nobserved number of red giant stars in the top one magnitude of the RGB in the\nLMC to predict the number of PNe in the LMC. We predict 548 PNe in good\nagreement with the 541+/-89 PNe observed by Reid & Parker (2006). Since most of\nthese PNe come from single or non-interacting binary stars in our model, this\nmeans that most such stars produce PNe contrary to the \"Binary Hypothesis\"\nwhich suggests that binary interaction is required to produce a PN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 08:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Among the approaches to finite elastoplasticity two became\nespecially popular. The first, implemented in the commercial finite element\ncodes, is based on the introduction of a hypoelastic constitutive law and the\nadditive elastic-plastic decomposition of the deformation rate tensor.\nUnfortunately, the use of hypoelasticity may lead to a nonphysical creation or\ndissipation of energy in a closed deformation cycle. In order to replace\nhypoelasticity with hyperelasticity the second popular approach based on the\nmultiplicative elastic-plastic decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor\nwas developed. Unluckily, the latter theory is not perfect as well because it\nintroduces intermediate plastic configurations, which are geometrically\nincompatible, non-unique, and, consequently, fictitious physically. In the\npresent work, an attempt is made to combine strengths of the described\napproaches avoiding their drawbacks. Particularly, a tensor of the plastic\ndeformation rate is introduced in the additive elastic-plastic decomposition of\nthe velocity gradient. This tensor is used in the flow rule defined by the\ngeneralized isotropic Reiner-Rivlin fluid. The tensor of the plastic\ndeformation rate is also used in an evolution equation that allows calculating\nan elastic strain tensor which, in its turn, is used in the hyperelastic\nconstitutive law. Thus, the present approach employs hyperelasticity and the\nadditive decomposition of the velocity gradient avoiding nonphysical\nhypoelasticity and the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient\nassociated with incompatible plastic configurations. The developed finite\nelastoplasticity framework for isotropic materials is specified to extend the\nclassical -theory of metal plasticity to large deformations and the simple\nshear deformation is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 09:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The first is that although many of the most popular artists are listened\nto around the world, music preferences are closely related to nationality,\nlanguage, and geographic location. We find support for this hypothesis, with a\ncouple of minor, yet interesting, exceptions. Our second hypothesis is that\nsome cities are consistently early adopters of new music (and early to snub\nstale music). To test this hypothesis, we adapt a method previously used to\ndetect the leadership networks present in flocks of birds. We find empirical\nsupport for the claim that a similar leadership network exists among cities,\nand this finding is the main contribution of the paper. Finally, we test the\nhypothesis that large cities tend to be ahead of smaller cities-we find only\nweak support for this hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 10:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-13"}

The result indicates that the Kondo\nresonance indeed can form ranged from the Kondo regime, to the mixed valence,\neven to the empty orbital regime. While the Kondo resonance displays as a sharp\npeak in the first regime, it has a peak-dip structure and/or an anti-resonance\nin the remaining two regimes, which result from the Fano resonance due to the\nsignificant background leaded by dramatically broadening of the impurity level\nin graphene. We also study the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) spectra of\nthe adatom and they show obvious particle-hole asymmetry when the chemical\npotential is tuned by the gate voltages applied to the graphene. Finally, we\nexplore the influence of the direct tunneling channel between the STM tip and\nthe graphene on the Kondo resonance and find that the lineshape of the Kondo\nresonance is unaffected, which can be attributed to unusual large asymmetry\nfactor in graphene.

To warm up, the backreaction of the (non)-minimally\ncoupled scalar field is solved, the scalar field equations are integrated and\nall the potentials compatible with the metric ansatz and Einstein gravity are\nfound. With these results at hand the non-linear sigma model is tackled. The\nscalar field Lagrangian is generic; neither the coupling to the curvature,\nneither the metric in the scalar manifold nor the potential, are fixed ab\ninitio. The unique assumption in the analysis is the metric ansatz: it has the\nform of the most general Petrov type D vacuum solution of general relativity;\nit is a a cohomogeneity two Weyl rescaling of the Carter metric and therefore\nit has the typical Plebanski-Demianski form with two arbitrary functions of one\nvariable and one arbitrary functions of two variables. It is shown, by an\nstraightforward manipulation of the field equations, that the metric is\ncompletely integrable without necessity of specifiying anything in the scalar\nLagrangian.

The metric functions generically show an\nexplicit dependence on a dynamical exponent that allows to smoothly connect\nthis new family of solutions with the actual Plebanski-Demianski spacetime. The\nremaining field equations imply that the scalar fields follow geodesics in the\nscalar manifold with an affine parameter given by a non-linear function of the\nspacetime coordinates and define the on-shell form of the potential plus a\nfunctional equation that it has to satisfy.

This\nleads to a practical protocol that allows any scientist - experimental or\ntheoretical - to determine justifiable error estimates for many basic property\npredictions, without having to perform additional DFT calculations. A central\nrole is played by a large and diverse test set of crystalline solids,\ncontaining all ground-state elemental crystals (except most lanthanides). For\nseveral properties of each crystal, the difference between DFT results and\nexperimental values is assessed. We discuss trends in these deviations and\nreview explanations suggested in the literature. A prerequisite for such an\nerror analysis is that different implementations of the same first-principles\nformalism provide the same predictions. Therefore, the reproducibility of\npredictions across several mainstream methods and codes is discussed too. A\nquality factor Delta expresses the spread in predictions from two distinct DFT\nimplementations by a single number. To compare the PAW method to the highly\naccurate APW+lo approach, a code assessment of VASP and GPAW with respect to\nWIEN2k yields Delta values of 1.9 and 3.3 meV/atom, respectively. These\ndifferences are an order of magnitude smaller than the typical difference with\nexperiment, and therefore predictions by APW+lo and PAW are for practical\npurposes identical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 14:12:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 09:55:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 08:47:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2013 09:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 12:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

In the case of second system the diamagnetic to paramagnetic\nphase transition is investigated by performing isothermal magnetization\nmeasurements in the two different phases.

We analyze a 3-species food web model with a heterogeneous\nresources and IGP. The model consists of two predators directly coupled via IGP\nrelation and indirectly via competition for resource. The resource is\nsubdivided into distinct subpopulations. Individuals in the subpopulations are\ngrazed at different rates by the predators. We consider two models: an IGP\nmodule with immobilization by the top predator and an IGP module with species\nturnover. We examine the effect of increasing enrichment and varying\nimmobilization (resource transfer) rate on a stable coexistence of predators\nand resources.
