We classify the lepton number\nviolating (LNV) effective operators with two leptons of either chirality but no\nquarks, ordered according to the magnitude of their contribution to \\znbb\ndecay. We point out that, for each of the three chirality assignments, $e_Le_L,\ne_Le_R$ and $e_Re_R$, there is only one LNV operator of the corresponding type\nto lowest order, and these have dimensions 5, 7 and 9, respectively.

We investigate the importance of introducing\nneutral particles using numerical 2.5D radiative MHD simulations obtained with\nthe Bifrost code. The models span from the upper layers of the convection zone\nto the low corona, and solve the full MHD equations with non-grey and NLTE\nradiative transfer, and thermal conduction. The effects of partial ionization\nare implemented using the generalized Ohm's law. The approximations required in\ngoing from three fluids to the generalized Ohm's law are tested in our\nsimulations. The Ohmic diffusion, the Hall term, and ambipolar diffusion show\nstrong variations in the chromosphere. These strong variations of the various\nmagnetic diffusivities are absent or significantly underestimated when, as has\nbeen common for these types of studies, using the VAL-C model as a basis for\nestimates. In addition, we find that differences in estimating the magnitude of\nambipolar diffusion arise depending on which method is used to calculate the\nion-neutral collision frequency. These differences cause uncertainties in the\ndifferent magnetic diffusivity terms. In the chromosphere, we find that the\nambipolar diffusion is of the same order of magnitude or even larger than the\nnumerical diffusion used to stabilize our code. As a consequence, ambipolar\ndiffusion produces a strong impact on the modeled atmosphere. Perhaps more\nimportantly, it suggests that at least in the chromospheric domain,\nself-consistent simulations of the solar atmosphere driven by\nmagneto-convection can accurately describe the impact of the dominant form of\nresistivity (ambipolar diffusion). This suggests that such simulations may be\nmore realistic in their approach to the lower solar atmosphere than previously\nassumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2012 17:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We present MHD simulations of cold front formation in the core\nof a galaxy cluster with anisotropic thermal conduction, exploring a parameter\nspace of conduction strengths parallel and perpendicular to the field lines.\nIncluding conduction has a strong effect on the temperature of the core and the\ncold fronts. Though magnetic field lines are draping parallel to the front\nsurfaces, the temperature jumps across the fronts are nevertheless reduced. The\nfield geometry is such that the cold gas below the front surfaces can be\nconnected to hotter regions outside via field lines along directions\nperpendicular to the plane of the sloshing motions and along sections of the\nfront which are not perfectly draped. This results in the heating of this gas\nbelow the front on a timescale of a Gyr, but the sharpness of the density and\ntemperature jumps may still be preserved. By modifying the density distribution\nbelow the front, conduction may indirectly aid in suppressing Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. If conduction along the field lines is unsuppressed, we find\nthat the characteristic sharp jumps in X-ray emission seen in observations of\nclusters do not form. This suggests that the presence of sharp cold fronts in\nhot clusters could be used to place upper limits on conduction in the {\\it\nbulk} of the ICM. Finally, the combination of sloshing and anisotropic thermal\nconduction can result in a larger flux of heat to the core than either process\nin isolation. While still not sufficient to prevent a cooling catastrophe in\nthe very central ($r \\sim$ 5 kpc) regions of the cool core, it reduces\nsignificantly the mass of cool gas that accumulates outside those radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2012 19:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2012 15:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Indeed, in inertial frames, there is a\ngeneral connection between classical field theories with classical zero-point\nradiation and quantum field theories. However, this connection does not extend\nto noninertial frames where the time parameter is not a geodesic coordinate.\nQuantum field theory applies the canonical quantization procedure (depending on\nthe local time coordinate) to a mirror-walled box, and, in general, each\nnon-inertial coordinate frame has its own vacuum state. In complete contrast,\nthe spectrum of random classical zero-point radiation is based upon symmetry\nprinciples of relativistic spacetime; in empty space, the correlation functions\ndepend upon only the geodesic separations (and their coordinate derivatives)\nbetween the spacetime points. It makes no difference whether a box of classical\nzero-point radiation is gradually or suddenly set into uniform acceleration;\nthe radiation in the interior retains the same correlation function except for\nsmall end-point (Casimir) corrections. Thus in classical theory where\nzero-point radiation is defined in terms of geodesic separations, there is\nnothing physically comparable to the quantum distinction between the Minkowski\nand Rindler vacuum states. It is also noted that relativistic classical systems\nwith internal potential energy must be spatially extended and can not be point\nsystems.

To\nquantitatively compare these different possibilities, a new method analysing\nangular momentum directions in modelled data is presented. It determines how\nlikely it is to find sets of angular momenta as concentrated and as close to a\npolar orientation as is observed for the MW satellite orbital poles. The method\ncan be easily applied to orbital pole data from different models. The observed\ndistribution of satellite orbital poles is compared to published angular\nmomentum directions of subhalos derived from six cosmological state-of-the-art\nsimulations in the Aquarius project. This tests the possibility that\nfilamentary accretion might be able to naturally explain the satellite orbits\nwithin the DoS. For the most likely alignment of main halo and MW disc spin,\nthe probability to reproduce the MW satellite orbital pole properties turns out\nto be less than 0.5 per cent in Aquarius models. Even an isotropic distribution\nof angular momenta has a higher likelihood to produce the observed\ndistribution. The two Via Lactea cosmological simulations give results similar\nto the Aquarius simulations. Comparing instead with numerical models of\ngalaxy-interactions gives a probability of up to 90 per cent for some models to\ndraw the observed distribution of orbital poles from the angular momenta of\ntidal debris.

For the profiles producing an appreciable signal, these target\nregions vastly overlap with the region corresponding to the so-called \"Fermi\nbubbles\".

All three possibilities have been\nfound in Monte-Carlo simulations of a modified spherically symmetric two-scale\nJagla model. Since the liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) frequently lies in a\nregion of the phase diagram that is difficult to access experimentally, it is\nof great interest to study critical phenomena in the supercritical region. We\ntherefore study the properties of the Widom line, which is defined in the\none-phase region above the critical point as the locus of maximum correlation\nlength as function of the ordering field at constant thermal field.\nAsymptotically close to the critical point, the Widom line coincides with the\nloci of the response function extrema, because all response functions can be\nasymptotically expressed as functions of the diverging correlation length. We\nfind that the method of identifying the Widom line as the loci of heat capacity\nmaxima becomes unfruitful when the slope of the coexistence line approaches\nzero in the $T$-$P$ plane. In this case the specific heat displays no maximum\nin the one-phase region because for a horizontal phase coexistence line,\naccording to the Clapeyron equation, the enthalpy difference between the\ncoexisting phases is zero, and thus there can be no contribution to enthalpy\nfluctuations from the critical fluctuations. The extension of the coexistence\nline beyond the critical point into the one-phase region must in this case be\nperformed using density fluctuations; the line of compressibility maxima\nremains well defined, though it bifurcates into a symmetrical pair of lines.\nThese findings agree well with the linear scaling theory of the LLCP by\nAnisimov and collaborators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 03:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-30"}

The bilinear coupling approximation (BCA), which has been used in\nnumerous previous related investigations, is compared with a novel local\ndensity approximation (LDA) for the ion-solvent interactions. It turns out that\nwithin BCA the bulk phase diagrams, the two-point correlation functions, and\ncritical adsorption exhibit qualitative features which are not compatible with\nthe available experimental data. These discrepancies do not occur within the\nproposed LDA. Further experimental investigations are suggested which assess\nthe reliability of the proposed LDA. This approach allows one to obtain a\nconsistent and rather general understanding of the effects of ions on solvent\nproperties.

The field of spintronics, where the spin of the electron is\nmanipulated rather than its charge, has recently also led to interest in spin\ncurrents. Contrary to charge currents, these spin currents can be subject to\nstrong relaxation due to collisions between different spin species, a\nphenomenon known as spin drag. This effect has been observed for electrons in\nsemi-conductors\\cite{Weber} and for cold fermionic atoms, where in both cases\nit is reduced at low temperatures due to the fermionic nature of the particles.\nHere, we perform a transport experiment using ultra-cold bosonic atoms and\nobserve spin drag for bosons for the first time. By lowering the temperature we\nfind that spin drag for bosons is enhanced in the quantum regime due to Bose\nstimulation, which is in agreement with recent theoretical predictions.

Four extended classes of\ncoordinate systems are used to unify and review both canonical and neural\nnetwork models of path integration, from the arthropod and mammalian\nliterature. This scheme demonstrates analytical equivalence between models\nwhich may otherwise appear unrelated, and distinguishes between models which\nmay superficially appear similar. A thorough analysis is carried out of the\nequational forms of important facets of path integration including updating,\nsteering, searching and systematic errors, using each of the four coordinate\nsystems. The type of available directional cue, namely allothetic or\nidiothetic, is also considered. It is shown that on balance, the class of home\nvectors which includes the geocentric Cartesian coordinate system, appears to\nbe the most robust for biological systems. A key conclusion is that deducing\ncomputational structure from behavioural data alone will be difficult or\nimpossible, at least in the absence of an analysis of random errors.\nConsequently it is likely that further theoretical insights into path\nintegration will require an in-depth study of the effect of noise on the four\nclasses of home vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 12:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-30"}

There is an obvious quantization of this dynamics\nwherein the wavefunction evolves according to the Hamiltonian H_0 equal to\n(half) the Laplacian on M_n. Born-Oppenheimer reduction of analogous mechanical\nsystems suggests, however, that this simple Hamiltonian should receive\ncorrections including k, the scalar curvature of M_n, and C, the n-soliton\nCasimir energy, which are usually difficult to compute, and whose effect on the\nenergy spectrum is unknown. This paper analyzes the spectra of H_0 and two\ncorrections to it suggested by work of Moss and Shiiki, namely H_1=H_0+k/4 and\nH_2=H_1+C, in the simple but nontrivial case of a single CP^1 lump moving on\nthe two-sphere. Here M_1=TSO(3), a noncompact kaehler 6-manifold invariant\nunder an SO(3)xSO(3) action, whose geometry is well understood. The symmetry\ngives rise to two conserved angular momenta, spin and isospin. A hidden\nisometry of M_1 is found which implies that all three energy spectra are\nsymmetric under spin-isospin interchange. The Casimir energy is found exactly\non the zero section of TSO(3), and approximated numerically on the rest of M_1.\nThe lowest 19 eigenvalues of H_i are found for i=0,1,2, and their spin-isospin\nand parity compared. The curvature corrections in H_1 lead to a qualitatively\nunchanged low-level spectrum while the Casimir energy in H_2 leads to\nsignificant changes. The scaling behaviour of the spectra under changes in the\nradii of the domain and target spheres is analyzed, and it is found that the\ndisparity between the spectra of H_1 and H_2 is reduced when the target sphere\nis made smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 13:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2013 18:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-12"}

For SAT and its counting version #SAT, hidden\nstructure has been exploited in terms of decomposability and strong backdoor\nsets. Decomposability can be considered in terms of the treewidth of a graph\nthat is associated with the given CNF formula, for instance by considering\nclauses and variables as vertices of the graph, and making a variable adjacent\nwith all the clauses it appears in. On the other hand, a strong backdoor set of\na CNF formula is a set of variables such that each possible partial assignment\nto this set moves the formula into a fixed class for which (#)SAT can be solved\nin polynomial time.\n  In this paper we combine the two above approaches. In particular, we study\nthe algorithmic question of finding a small strong backdoor set into the class\nW_t of CNF formulas whose associated graphs have treewidth at most t. The main\nresults are positive:\n  (1) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F and two\nconstants k,t\\ge 0, either finds a strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most 2^k,\nor concludes that F has no strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most k.\n  (2) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F, computes the\nnumber of satisfying assignments of F or concludes that sb_t(F)>k, for any pair\nof constants k,t\\ge 0. Here, sb_t(F) denotes the size of a smallest strong\nW_t-backdoor set of F.\n  The significance of our results lies in the fact that they allow us to\nexploit algorithmically a hidden structure in formulas that is not accessible\nby any one of the two approaches (decomposability, backdoors) alone. Already a\nbackdoor size 1 on top of treewidth 1 (i.e., sb_1(F)=1) entails formulas of\narbitrarily large treewidth and arbitrarily large cycle cutsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 14:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-30"}

When the proximity coupling is weak, the\nFTSC has the same topological order as its parent state and is thus Abelian.\nHowever, upon increasing the proximity coupling, the bulk gap of such an\nAbelian FTSC closes and reopens resulting in a new topological order: a\nnon-Abelian FTSC. Using several arguments we will conjecture that the conformal\nfield theory (CFT) that describes the edge state of the non-Abelian FTSC is\n$U(1)/Z_2$ orbifold theory and use this to write down the ground-state wave\nfunction. Further, we predict FTSC based on the Laughlin state at $\\nu=1/m$\nfilling to host fractionalized Majorana zero modes bound to superconducting\nvortices. These zero modes are non-Abelian quasiparticles which is evident in\ntheir quantum dimension of $d_m=\\sqrt{2m}$. Using the multi-quasi-particle wave\nfunction based on the edge CFT, we derive the projective braid matrix for the\nzero modes. Finally, the connection between the non-Abelian FTSCs and the\n$Z_{2m}$ rotor model with a similar topological order is illustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Apr 2012 15:16:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2012 13:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 20:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 19:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-28"}
