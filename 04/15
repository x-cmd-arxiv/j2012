The background conductivity is taken to be one and we\nassume the medium contains high (or low) conductivity inclusions. We derive an\nasymptotic expansion with respect to the contrast and provide a procedure to\ncompute the terms in the expansion. The computation of the expansion does not\ndepend on the contrast which is important for simulations. The latter allows\navoiding increased mesh resolution around high conductivity features. This work\nis partly motivated by our earlier work in \\cite{ge09_1} where we design\nefficient numerical procedures for solving high-contrast problems. These\nmultiscale approaches require local solutions and our proposed high-order\nexpansion can be used to approximate these local solutions inexpensively. In\nthe case of a large-number of inclusions, the proposed analysis can help to\ndesign localization techniques for computing the terms in the expansion. In the\npaper, we present a rigorous analysis of the proposed high-order expansion and\nestimate the remainder of it. We consider both high and low conductivity\ninclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 16:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

The equivalence hypothesis can\nbe viewed as adaptation of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to quantum\nmechanics. The construction reveals two key identities that underly the\nformalism in Euclidean or Minkowski spaces. The first is a cocycle condition,\nwhich is invariant under $D$--dimensional Mobius transformations with Euclidean\nor Minkowski metrics. The second is a quadratic identity which is a\nrepresentation of the D-dimensional quantum Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In this\napproach, the solutions of the associated Schrodinger equation are used to\nsolve the nonlinear quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation. A basic property of the\nconstruction is that the two solutions of the corresponding Schrodinger\nequation must be retained. The quantum potential, which arises in the\nformalism, can be interpreted as a curvature term. I propose that the quantum\npotential, which is always non-trivial and is an intrinsic energy term\ncharacterising a particle, can be interpreted as dark energy. Numerical\nestimates of its magnitude show that it is extremely suppressed. In the\nmulti--particle case the quantum potential, as well as the mass, are\ncumulative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 16:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-25"}

This suggests that for these galaxies, ULXs trace\nrecent star formation. However, for the most infrared-luminous galaxies, we\nfind a deficiency of ULXs compared to the infrared luminosity. For these very\ninfrared-luminous galaxies, AGNs may contribute to powering the far-infrared;\nalternatively, ULXs may be highly obscured in the X-ray in these galaxies and\ntherefore not detected by these Chandra observations.

In the case of Nim,\nwe observe that the introduction of the pass dramatically alters the game's\nunderlying structure, rendering it considerably more complex, while for Chomp,\nthe pass move is found to have relatively minimal impact. We show how these\nresults can be understood by recasting these games as dynamical systems\ndescribable by dynamical recursion relations. From these recursion relations we\nare able to identify underlying structural connections between these \"games\nwith passes\" and a recently introduced class of \"generic (perturbed) games.\"\nThis connection, together with a (non-rigorous) numerical stability analysis,\nallows one to understand and predict the effect of a pass on a game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Apr 2012 22:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

Given the steep bright-end slope of the LFs, when the detector\nfield-of view (FOV) is comparable to the angular extent of a massive lensing\ncluster, imaging cluster(s) is more efficient in detecting z ~ 7 LAEs than\nimaging a blank field. However, the gain is expected to be modest, a factor of\ntwo at most and likely much less depending on the adopted LFs. The main\nadvantage of lensing-cluster survey, therefore, remains to be the gain in depth\nand not necessarily in detection efficiency. For much larger detectors, the\nlensing effect becomes negligible and the efficiency of LAE detection is\nproportional to the instrumental FOV.

The solution is\nrepresented in the form of a segment of a series in the powers of the step size\nof the independent variable in the finite-difference scheme. The algorithm\ngenerates a schematic representation that approximates the convergent\nfinite-difference scheme, which, in turn, approximates the equation under\nconsideration. The use of probabilistic methods allows us to average the\nrecurrent calculations and exclude intermediate levels of computation. All the\nstages of formalizing operations of the classical computer result in \"the\nmethod of the computer analogy\". The proposed method leads to an explicit\nanalytical representation of the solution. We present the general features of\nthe algorithm which are illustrated by an example of solutions for a system of\nnonlinear equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2012 08:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-17"}

As a\nresult of this, the recirculation zone moves forward and backward during the\ntransients and the pressure in the secondary chamber rises and falls. The\nsystem behaves as a damped oscillatory flow in which the direction of mass flux\nkeeps on changing and finally settles down to a state where there is no mass\nflux in either direction. The movement of recirculation zone due to this\ninertial effect is studied in more detail for various flow and geometric\nparameters. The results obtained show that the pressure and mass flux through\nthe secondary chamber depend highly on both the thickness of the primary and\nsecondary jet and the chamber volume. The inertial effect reduces with the\nreduction in thickness of primary and secondary flow. The inertial effect is\nfound to be decreasing with increasing secondary chamber volume.

In\nparticular for a pseudo-scalar meson field theory such kind of states were\nderived by Pauli and Dancoff in 1942 with equal amount of spin and isospin.\nThey can be understood as arising from excitation of the pionic cloud of the\nnucleon by which the main part of nuclear forces also is coming out. The\nexcitation of these states also is the mechanism by which the pion-nucleon\nresonance scattering is originated which firstly was experimentally discovered\nby Fermi in 1955.\n  In the following contribution a completion of the method of Wentzel and Pauli\n& Dancoff is sketched following a work of the author and treating the\npion-nucleon resonance scattering. By means of a canonical and nonlinear\ntransformation of variables the original meson field is split into a free meson\npart and a self field part of the nucleon. The transformation is defined such\nthat the interaction between the compound nucleon system thus arising and the\nfree mesons vanish in the case of infinitely strong coupling. The solution of\nthis field splitting problem is presented and the problem of calculating the\npion-nucleon resonance scattering from this strong-coupling theory is treated\non this basis. Numerical results obtained from such a calculation are\ndiscussed. For the sake of simplicity the symmetric pseudoscalar\nfixed-and-extended-source meson field theory is used and found that the lowest\npion-nucleon resonance scattering is quite well reproduced with essentially the\nsame parameters necessary to reproduce the nucleon-nucleon-potential. The\npresent investigation will serve to guide more extended considerations in this\ndirection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Apr 2012 13:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 07:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-18"}

Because of this, Yang-Mills matter falls into\ntwo qualitatively different regimes: the \"low-$N_c$ limit\", where percolation\ndoes not occur because matter deconfines before it percolates, and the\nhigh-$N_c$ limit, where there are three distinct phases characterizing\nYang-Mills matter at finite temperature and density: confined, deconfined and\nconfined but percolating matter.

First, as in polar active\nfluids, the control parameter for the order-disorder transition, namely the\ndensity, is dynamically convected by active currents, resulting in a generic,\nmodel independent dynamical self-regulation that destabilizes the uniform\nnematic state near the mean-field transition. Secondly, curvature driven\ncurrents render the system unstable deep in the nematic state, as found\npreviously. Finally, and unique to self-propelled nematics, nematic order\ninduces local polar order that in turn leads to the growth of density\nfluctuations.
