However, it has become apparent that different methods that reproduce\nthe experimental band gap can yield substantially different results regarding\ncharge transition levels of point defects. We investigate this problem in the\ncase of the (+2/0) charge transition level of the O vacancy in ZnO, which has\nattracted considerable attention as a benchmark case. For this purpose, we\nfirst perform calculations based on non-screened hybrid density functionals,\nand then compare our results with those of other methods.

The proposed procedure consists in aligning the electron band\nstructure through an external potential, such as the vacuum level. When the\nelectron densities are well reproduced, this procedure is equivalent to an\nalignment through the average electrostatic potential in a calculation subject\nto periodic boundary conditions.

In particular, our\nmodel problem is formulated in terms of binary variables, and floating-point\noperations can be (almost) completely avoided. The FPGA architecture allows us\nto run many independent threads with almost no latencies in memory access, thus\nupdating up to 1024 spins per cycle. We describe Janus in detail and we\nsummarize the physics results obtained in four years of operation of this\nmachine; we discuss two types of physics applications: long simulations on very\nlarge systems (which try to mimic and provide understanding about the\nexperimental non-equilibrium dynamics), and low-temperature equilibrium\nsimulations using an artificial parallel tempering dynamics. The time scale of\nour non-equilibrium simulations spans eleven orders of magnitude (from\npicoseconds to a tenth of a second). On the other hand, our equilibrium\nsimulations are unprecedented both because of the low temperatures reached and\nfor the large systems that we have brought to equilibrium. A finite-time\nscaling ansatz emerges from the detailed comparison of the two sets of\nsimulations. Janus has made it possible to perform spin-glass simulations that\nwould take several decades on more conventional architectures. The paper ends\nwith an assessment of the potential of possible future versions of the Janus\narchitecture, based on state-of-the-art technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 17:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

We first consider the question of learnability for statistical learning\nproblems in the general learning setting. The question of learnability is well\nstudied and fully characterized for binary classification and for real valued\nsupervised learning problems using the theory of uniform convergence. However\nwe show that for the general learning setting uniform convergence theory fails\nto characterize learnability. To fill this void we use stability of learning\nalgorithms to fully characterize statistical learnability in the general\nsetting. Next we consider the problem of online learning. Unlike the\nstatistical learning framework there is a dearth of generic tools that can be\nused to establish learnability and rates for online learning problems in\ngeneral. We provide online analogs to classical tools from statistical learning\ntheory like Rademacher complexity, covering numbers, etc. We further use these\ntools to fully characterize learnability for online supervised learning\nproblems.\n  II. In the second part, for general classes of convex learning problems, we\nprovide appropriate mirror descent (MD) updates for online and statistical\nlearning of these problems. Further, we show that the the MD is near optimal\nfor online convex learning and for most cases, is also near optimal for\nstatistical convex learning. We next consider the problem of convex\noptimization and show that oracle complexity can be lower bounded by the so\ncalled fat-shattering dimension of the associated linear class. Thus we\nestablish a strong connection between offline convex optimization problems and\nstatistical learning problems. We also show that for a large class of high\ndimensional optimization problems, MD is in fact near optimal even for convex\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 17:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-19"}

The method,\ntermed multilevel sparse kernel-based interpolation (MLSKI, for short), uses\nboth level-wise and direction-wise multilevel decomposition of structured (or\nmildly unstructured) interpolation data sites in conjunction with the\napplication of kernel-based interpolants with different scaling in each\ndirection. The multilevel interpolation algorithm is based on a hierarchical\ndecomposition of the data sites, whereby at each level the detail is added to\nthe interpolant by interpolating the resulting residual of the previous level.\nOn each level, anisotropic radial basis functions are used for solving a number\nof small interpolation problems, which are subsequently linearly combined to\nproduce the interpolant. MLSKI can be viewed as an extension of $d$-boolean\ninterpolation (which is closely related to ideas in sparse grid and hyperbolic\ncrosses literature) to kernel-based functions, within the hierarchical\nmultilevel framework to achieve accelerated convergence. Numerical experiments\nsuggest that the new algorithm is numerically stable and efficient for the\nreconstruction of large data in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\times \\mathbb{R}$, for $d = 2,\n3, 4$, with tens or even hundreds of thousands data points.

When present, transitions at low temperature or low noise correspond\nto entropy driven (or \"order by disorder\") annealing effects wherein stability\nmay initially increase as temperature or noise is increased before becoming\nunsolvable at sufficiently high temperature or noise. Additional transitions\nbetween contending viable solutions (such as those at different natural scales)\nare also possible. When analyzing community structure via a dynamical approach,\n\"chaotic-type\" transitions were previously identified [Phil. Mag. {\\bf 92} 406\n(2012)]. The correspondence between the spin-glass-type complexity transitions\nand transitions into chaos in dynamical analogs might extend to other hard\ncomputational problems. In this work, we examine large networks that have a\nlarge number of communities. We infer that large systems at a constant ratio of\n$q$ to the number of nodes $N$ asymptotically tend toward insolvability in the\nlimit of large $N$ for any positive $T$. The asymptotic behavior of\ntemperatures below which structure identification might be possible, $T_\\times\n=O[1/\\log q]$, decreases slowly, so for practical system sizes, there remains\nan accessible, and generally easy, global solvable phase at low temperature. We\nfurther employ multivariate Tutte polynomials to show that increasing $q$\nemulates increasing $T$ for a general Potts model, leading to a similar\nstability region at low $T$. Given the relation between Tutte and Jones\npolynomials, our results further suggest a link between the above complexity\ntransitions and transitions associated with random knots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 19:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

While models accurately reproduce the z=0 number density, they require\nthat the evolution occurs rapidly at early times, which is incompatible with\nthe strong late evolution found observationally. We report here the same\ndiscrepancy in two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations,\nwhich is evidence that the problem is fundamental.

Firstly, we look for\nevidence of a different history of today's low mass galaxies in models and\nobservations and we find that the models yield too few young, strongly\nstar-forming galaxies. Secondly, we construct a toy model to link the observed\nevolution of specific star formation rates (sSFR) with the evolution of the\ngalaxy stellar mass function. We infer from this model that a key problem in\nboth semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models is the presence of a positive\ninstead of a negative correlation between sSFR and stellar mass. A similar\npositive correlation is found between the specific dark matter halo accretion\nrate and the halo mass, indicating that model galaxies are growing in a way\nthat follows the growth of their host haloes too closely. It therefore appears\nnecessary to find a mechanism that decouples the growth of low mass galaxies,\nwhich occurs primarily at late times, from the growth of their host haloes,\nwhich occurs primarily at early times.

Therefore a\ncircumbinary disc forms with a random inclination angle, theta, to the binary.\nIt is known that for theta < 90 degrees the disc will coalign wrt the binary.\nIf theta > 90 degrees the disc wholly counteraligns if it satisfies cos(theta)\n< -J_d/2J_b, where J_d and J_b are the magnitudes of the disc and binary\nangular momentum vectors respectively. If however theta > 90 degrees and this\ncriterion is not satisfied the same disc may counteralign its inner regions\nand, on longer timescales, coalign its outer regions. I show that for typical\ndisc parameters, describing an accretion event on to a supermassive black hole\nbinary, a misaligned circumbinary disc is likely to wholly co-- or\ncounter--align with the binary plane. This is because the binary angular\nmomentum dominates the disc angular momentum.

The models\novercome a major restriction of disk-reflection models, namely the assumption\nof an infinite column density. Finite column-density models produce a richer\nvariety of spectral shapes and characteristics, even for Compton-thin AGNs.\nAlthough NGC 4945 is one of the brightest AGNs above 10 keV, the models span\nnearly a factor of 3 in column density (~2 to 6 x 10^{24} cm^{-2}) and 2 orders\nof magnitude in the intrinsic 2-195 keV luminosity. Models in which the\ncontinuum above 10 keV is dominated by the direct (unscattered) continuum or\nCompton-scattered continuum give the highest and lowest intrinsic luminosities\nrespectively. Variability properties favor solutions in which the unscattered\ncontinuum dominates above 10 keV. The data require that the Compton-scattered\ncontinuum and Fe Kalpha line emission come predominantly from the illuminated\nsurfaces of the X-ray reprocessor, implying a clumpy medium with a global\ncovering factor that is small enough that the Compton-scattered continuum does\nnot dominate the spectrum above 10 keV.

It is shown possible to use self-adaptive, open-ended evolution\nto design an ensemble of such fuzzy dynamical systems within XCSF to solve\nseveral well-known continuous-valued test problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 20:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-29"}

The discovery of SMBHs in late-type galaxies\nwith little or no bulge suggests that an underlying correlation between the\ndark matter halo concentration and SMBH mass (MBH) exists, rather than between\nthe bulge mass and MBH. In this paper we measure P using a two-dimensional fast\nfourier transform and estimate the bar pattern speeds of 40 barred spiral\ngalaxies from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey. The pattern speeds were\nderived by estimating the gravitational potentials of our galaxies from Ks-band\nimages and using them to produce dynamical simulation models. The pattern\nspeeds allow us to identify those galaxies with low central dark halo\ndensities, or fast rotating bars, while P provides an estimate of MBH. We find\nthat a wide range of MBH exists in galaxies with low central dark matter halo\ndensities, which appears to support other theoretical results. We also find\nthat galaxies with low central dark halo densities appear to follow more\npredictable trends in P versus de Vaucouleurs morphological type (T) and bar\nstrength versus T than barred galaxies in general. The empirical relationship\nbetween MBH and total gravitational mass of a galaxy (Mtot) allows us to\npredict the minimum Mtot that will be observationally measured of our fast bar\ngalaxies. These predictions will be investigated in a subsequent paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 21:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

It is widely believed that sophisticated quantum error\ncorrection codes, such as quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, will\nbe pivotal in such a role. However, recently the importance of the channel\nmismatch effect in degrading the performance of deployed quantum LDPC codes has\nbeen pointed out.

We apply these concepts to software,\ndefining mutational robustness to be the fraction of random mutations that\nleave a program's behavior unchanged. Test cases are used to measure program\nbehavior and mutation operators are taken from genetic programming. Although\nsoftware is often viewed as brittle, with small changes leading to catastrophic\nchanges in behavior, our results show surprising robustness in the face of\nrandom software mutations.\n  The paper describes empirical studies of the mutational robustness of 22\nprograms, including 14 production software projects, the Siemens benchmarks,\nand 4 specially constructed programs. We find that over 30% of random mutations\nare neutral with respect to their test suite. The results hold across all\nclasses of programs, for mutations at both the source code and assembly\ninstruction levels, across various programming languages, and are only weakly\nrelated to test suite coverage. We conclude that mutational robustness is an\ninherent property of software, and that neutral variants (i.e., those that pass\nthe test suite) often fulfill the program's original purpose or specification.\n  Based on these results, we conjecture that neutral mutations can be leveraged\nas a mechanism for generating software diversity. We demonstrate this idea by\ngenerating a population of neutral program variants and showing that the\nvariants automatically repair unknown bugs with high probability. Neutral\nlandscapes also provide a partial explanation for recent results that use\nevolutionary computation to automatically repair software bugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 23:28:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 21:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2013 19:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-28"}

However, it is\ntypically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS depend\non knowing ||x||_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven\nway. A second practical concern is that ||x||_0 is a highly unstable function\nof x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the\nvalue ||x||_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number of\ncoordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity\ns(x):=||x||_1^2/||x||_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on ||x||_0. Our\nestimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not\nrely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation. A\nconfidence interval for s(x) is provided, and its width is shown to have no\ndependence on the signal dimension p. Moreover, this result extends naturally\nto the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can be\nestimated with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use of\nrandomized measurements is essential to estimating s(x). This is accomplished\nby proving that the minimax risk for estimating s(x) with deterministic\nmeasurements is large when n<<p.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 00:43:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2013 14:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

A key step for resolving this issue is to acquire a\ncomprehensive picture regarding the nature of various phases and interactions\nin the iron compounds.

The spin density wave gap in the parent state is observed\nfor the first time, which shows a strongly asymmetric lineshape that is\nincompatible with the conventional Fermi surface nesting scenario. The\noptimally doped sample exhibits a single, symmetric energy gap, but in the\noverdoped regime another asymmetric gap-like feature emerges near the Fermi\nlevel. This novel gap-like phase coexists with superconductivity in the ground\nstate, persists deep into the normal state, and shows strong spatial\nvariations. The characteristics of the three distinct low energy states, in\nconjunction with the peculiar high energy spectra, suggest that the coupling\nbetween the local moments and itinerant electrons is the fundamental driving\nforce for the phases and phase transitions in the iron pnictides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 02:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

While single-field inflation with\nthe standard Bunch-Davies initial vacuum state does not generally produce a\nmeasurable three-point function (bispectrum) in the squeezed configuration,\nallowing for a non-standard initial state produces an exception. Here, we\ncalculate the signature of an initial state modification in single-field\nslow-roll inflation in both the scale-dependent bias of the large-scale\nstructure (LSS) and mu-type distortion in the black-body spectrum of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB).

In both cases, we\nobserve a distinctive k^-3 signature in LSS (as opposed to k^-2 for the\nlocal-form). As a non-zero bispectrum in the squeezed configuration correlates\na long-wavelength mode with two short-wavelength modes, it induces a\ncorrelation between the CMB temperature anisotropy on large scales with the\ntemperature-anisotropy-squared on very small scales; this correlation persists\nas the small-scale anisotropy-squared is processed into mu-type distortions.\nWhile the local-form mu-distortion turns out to be too small to detect in the\nnear future, a modified initial vacuum state enhances the signal by a large\nfactor owing to an extra factor of k_1/k. For example, a proposed\nabsolutely-calibrated experiment, PIXIE, is expected to detect this correlation\nwith a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10, for an occupation number of about\n0.5 in the observable modes.

We perform\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) of an MHD fluid with a forced cosmic ray\ncurrent and use the test-field method to determine the alpha effect and the\nturbulent magnetic diffusivity. As follows from DNS, the dynamics of the\ninstability has the following stages: (i) in the early stage, the small-scale\nBell instability that results in a production of small-scale turbulence is\nexcited; (ii) in the intermediate stage, there is formation of larger-scale\nmagnetic structures; (iii) finally, quasi-stationary large-scale turbulence is\nformed at a growth rate that is comparable to that expected from the dynamo\ninstability, but its amplitude over much longer timescales remains unclear.

The key idea behind RDMEX is to model the transmitters as time\nseries of signalling molecule counts, while diffusion in the medium and\nchemical reactions at the receivers are modelled as Markov processes using\nmaster equation. An advantage of RDMEX is that it can readily be used to model\nmolecular communication networks with multiple transmitters and receivers.

A diffuse scattering was observed in BMT near\nthe (H\\pm1/2, K\\pm1/2, L\\pm1/2) points in the Brillouin zone and this had a\ncharacteristic cube shape.

Our technical results are algorithms for finding fair allocations\ncorresponding to two fairness notions: Regarding the notion suggested by Ghodsi\net al., we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an allocation for\na general class of fairness notions, in which their notion is included. For the\nother, suggested by Dolev et al., we show that a competitive market equilibrium\nachieves the desired notion of fairness, thereby obtaining a polynomial-time\nalgorithm that computes such a fair allocation and solving the main open\nproblem raised by Dolev et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 08:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-20"}

To critically examine the performance and sensitivity of SBM, we used\nit in the observation of the annular solar eclipse in Dali City, Yunnan, on 15\nJanuary 2010. The observation met good weather condition with almost clear sky\nduring the eclipse. The SBM measurement translates into the solar illuminance\nchanges at a level of 2.4 \\times 10-4I s-1 during the eclipse. The time of the\nminimal sky brightness in the field of view (FOV) is found consistent with the\ntime of maximum eclipse. Two local sky regions in the FOV are chosen to make\ntime series of calibrated skylight profiles. The evolution of the sky\nbrightness thus calibrated also shows good consistency with the eclipse,\nparticularly between the second and the third contacts. The minimal sky\nbrightness in each local sky region took place within half a minute from the\ncorresponding predicted contact time. Such small time delays were mainly caused\nby occasional cirri. The minimal sky brightness measured during the eclipse is\na few millionths of I\\odot with standard deviation of 0.11 millionths of\nI\\odot. The observation supports that the singlescattering process (optically\nthin conditions) is the main contributor to the atmospheric scattering.

By\nconvolving lensing maps with a filter function of a specific scale, chosen to\nbe larger than the scale on which the noise is dominant, the lensing signal may\nbe boosted with respect to the noise. This allows for detection of structures\nat increased fidelity. Furthermore, higher-order statistics of the aperture\nmass (such as its skewness or kurtosis), or counting of the peaks seen in the\nresulting aperture mass maps, provide a convenient and effective method to\nconstrain the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we more fully explore the\nformalism underlying the aperture mass statistic. We demonstrate that the\naperture mass statistic is formally identical to a wavelet transform at a\nspecific scale. Further, we show that the filter functions most frequently used\nin aperture mass studies are not ideal, being non-local in both real and\nFourier space. In contrast, the wavelet formalism offers a number of wavelet\nfunctions that are localized both in real and Fourier space, yet similar to the\n'optimal' aperture mass filters commonly adopted. Additionally, for a number of\nwavelet functions, such as the starlet wavelet, very fast algorithms exist to\ncompute the wavelet transform. This offers significant advantages over the\nusual aperture mass algorithm when it comes to image processing time,\ndemonstrating speed-up factors of ~ 5 - 1200 for aperture radii in the range 2\nto 64 pixels on an image of 1024 x 1024 pixels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 09:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Until this problem is resolved, our understanding of finite algebras\nis incomplete, since, given an arbitrary finite algebra, we cannot say whether\nthere are any restrictions on the shape of its congruence lattice. By a well\nknown result of Palfy and Pudlak, the problem would be solved if we could prove\nthe existence of a finite lattice that is not an interval in the lattice of\nsubgroups of a finite group. Thus the problem of characterizing congruence\nlattices of finite algebras is closely related to the problem of characterizing\nintervals in subgroup lattices.\n  In this work, we review a number of methods for finding a finite algebra with\na given congruence lattice, including searching for intervals in subgroup\nlattices. We also consider methods for proving that algebras with a given\ncongruence lattice exist without actually constructing them. By combining these\nwell known methods with a new method we have developed, and with much help from\ncomputer software like the UACalc and GAP, we prove that with one possible\nexception every lattice with at most seven elements is isomorphic to the\ncongruence lattice of a finite algebra. As such, we have identified the unique\nsmallest lattice for which there is no known representation. We examine this\nexceptional lattice in detail, and prove results that characterize the class of\nalgebras that could possibly represent this lattice.\n  We conclude with what we feel are the most interesting open questions\nsurrounding this problem and discuss possibilities for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 10:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Apr 2012 10:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 May 2012 07:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-08"}

The achievable rate\nformulas that we use are for full-duplex radios at the relays and decode-\nand-forward relaying. For the single relay case, and individual power\nconstraints at the source node and the relay node, we provide explicit formulas\nfor the optimal relay location and the optimal power allocation to the\nsource-relay channel, for the exponential and the power-law path-loss channel\nmodels. For the multiple relay case, we consider exponential path-loss and a\ntotal power constraint over the source and the relays, and derive an\noptimization problem, the solution of which provides the optimal relay\nlocations. Numerical results suggest that at low attenuation the relays are\nmostly clustered close to the source in order to be able to cooperate among\nthemselves, whereas at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and work as\nrepeaters.\n  The structure of the optimal power allocation for a given placement of the\nnodes, then motivates us to formulate the problem of impromptu (\"as-you-go\")\nplacement of relays along a line of exponentially distributed length, with\nexponential path- loss, so as to minimize a cost function that is additive over\nhops. The hop cost trades off a capacity limiting term, motivated from the\noptimal power allocation solution, against the cost of adding a relay node.

We define a region in the X-ray/IR vs. HR\nplane associated to CT AGN, i.e. F(2-12keV)/F25nu25<0.02 and HR>-0.2. We build\nup a sample of 43 CT AGN candidates using data from IRAS-PSC and 2XMM\ncatalogue. In order to test the efficiency of the proposed method in selecting\nCT AGN we use the results of the X-ray spectral analysis performed on all the\nsources of our sample. After taking into account the different selection\neffects, we have estimated the number of CT in the local Universe and their\ndensity down to the IRAS flux limit of F25=0.5Jy. We find that the diagnostic\nplot proposed here is an efficient method to select Compton-thick AGN in the\nnearby Universe since ~84% of the sources populating the proposed CT region are\nactually CT AGN. Twenty percent are newly-discovered CT AGN. We then estimate\nthe surface density of CT AGN down to the IRAS PSC catalogue flux limit\n(F25=0.5Jy) that turns out to be ~3e-3 src deg-2. After estimating an\nequivalent IR-hard X-ray limiting flux, we compare our result with those found\nwith SWIFT-BAT. We find that the surface density derived here is a factor 4\nabove the density computed in the hard X-ray surveys. This difference is\nascribed, at least in part, to a significant contribution (~60-90%) of the\nstar-forming activity to the total 25 mic emission for the sources in our\nsample. By considering only the 25 mic AGN emission, we estimate a surface\ndensity of CT AGN which is consistent with the results found by hard X-ray\nsurveys.

The prediction for CT\nAGN based on the synthesis model of XRB in Gilli et al.(2007) is consistent\nwith this value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 14:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

[Aims]\nThis paper explores the kinematics of the gas around a young massive star with\nmillimeter-wave interferometry to improve our understanding of the formation of\nmassive stars though accretion. [Methods] We use Plateau de Bure\ninterferometric images to probe the environment of the nearby (~1 kpc) and\nluminous (~20000 Lsun) high-mass (10-16 Msun) young star AFGL 2591-VLA3 in\ncontinuum and in lines of HDO, H218O and SO2 in the 115 and 230 GHz bands.\nRadiative transfer calculations are employed to investigate the kinematics of\nthe source. [Results] At ~0.5\" (500 AU) resolution, the line images clearly\nresolve the velocity field of the central compact source (diameter of ~ 800 AU)\nand show linear velocity gradients in the northeast-southwest direction.\nJudging from the disk-outflow geometry, the observed velocity gradient results\nfrom rotation and radial expansion in the equatorial region of VLA3. Radiative\ntransfer calculations suggest that the velocity field is consistent with\nsub-Keplerian rotation plus Hubble-law like expansion. The line profiles of the\nobserved molecules suggest a layered structure, with HDO emission arising from\nthe disk mid-plane, H218O from the warm mid-layer, and SO2 from the upper disk.\n[Conclusions] We propose AFGL 2591-VLA3 as a new massive disk candidate, with\npeculiar kinematics. The rotation of this disk is sub-Keplerian, probably due\nto magnetic braking, while the stellar wind may be responsible for the\nexpansion of the disk.

Radial migration of intermediate size solids toward the central star\nmay prevent their growth to larger solid grains. On the other hand, vortices\ncan trap the dust and accelerate this growth, counteracting fast radial\ntransport. Multiple effects have been shown to affect this scenario, such as\nvortex migration or decay. The aim of this paper is to study the formation of\nvortices by the Rossby wave instability and their long term evolution in a full\nthree dimensional protoplanetary disc. We use a robust numerical scheme\ncombined with adaptive mesh refinement in cylindrical coordinates, allowing to\naffordably compute long term 3D evolutions. We consider a full disc stratified\nboth radially and vertically that is prone to formation of vortices by the\nRossby wave instability. We show that the 3D Rossby vortices grow and survive\nover hundreds of years without migration. The localized overdensity which\ninitiated the instability and vortex formation survives the growth of the\nRossby wave instability for very long times. When the vortices are no longer\nsustained by the Rossby wave instability, their shape changes toward more\nelliptical vortices. This allows them to survive shear-driven destruction, but\nthey may be prone to elliptical instability and slow decay. When the conditions\nfor growing Rossby wave-related instabilities are maintained in the disc,\nlarge-scale vortices can survive over very long timescales and may be able to\nconcentrate solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Apr 2012 15:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In\nthis work is shown that in general, for any field of random force with uniform\ndistribution of directions, the probability to gain kinetic energy is larger\nthat the probability to lose it. Therefore, if the particle is submitted to a\ngreat number of interactions with the force stochastic field, the final result\nwill be that the particle will gain energy. The probability to gain energy in\neach interaction is Pg=1/2 (1+T/(2Po)), where T is the impulse given by the\nfield and Po is the momentum of the particle before the interaction. The\nprobability to lose energy in each interaction is Pl=1/2 (1-T/(2Po)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 21:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-24"}
