With the use of\nobservationally derived surface magnetic field maps, we simulate the magnetic\nstellar wind of Tau Boo by means of three-dimensional MHD numerical\nsimulations. As the properties of the stellar wind depend on the particular\ncharacteristics of the stellar magnetic field, we show that the wind varies\nduring the observed epochs of the cycle. Although the mass loss-rates we find\n(~2.7e-12 Msun/yr) vary less than 3 per cent during the observed epochs of the\ncycle, our derived angular momentum loss-rates vary from 1.1 to 2.2e32erg.

This\nquark loop is then calculated, using as basic ingredients the full quark\npropagator and quark-gluon vertex; for the quark propagator we use the solution\nobtained from the quark gap equation, while for the vertex we employ suitable\nAns\\\"atze, which guarantee the transversality of the answer.

We have compared the radio luminosities and projected lengths of these FR\nIIs to the projected length distribution of a range of mock catalogs generated\nby an FR II model and estimate the FR II lifetime to be 1.9 x 10^8 yr. The\nuncertainty in the lifetime calculation is a factor of two, due primarily to\nuncertainties in the ICM density and the FR II axial ratio. We furthermore\nmeasure the jet power distribution of FR IIs in BCGs and find that it is well\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution with a median power of 1.1 x 10^37 W and\na coefficient of variation of 2.2. These jet powers are nearly linearly related\nto the observed luminosities, and this relation is steeper than many other\nestimates, although it is dependent on the jet model. We investigate\ncorrelations between FR II and cluster properties and find that galaxy\nluminosity is correlated with jet power. This implies that jet power is also\ncorrelated with black hole mass, as the stellar luminosity of a BCG should be a\ngood proxy for its spheroid mass and therefore the black hole mass. Jet power,\nhowever, is not correlated with cluster richness, nor is FR II lifetime\nstrongly correlated with any cluster properties.

CO\nline emission is not detected in either DOG. We calculate 3-sigma upper limits\nto the CO J=2-1 line luminosities, L'_CO < 6.08x10^9 and < 6.63x10^9 K km/s\npc^2. Assuming a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor derived for ultraluminous infrared\ngalaxies in the local Universe, this translates to limits on the cold molecular\ngas mass of M_H_2 < 4.86x10^9 Msun and M_H_2 < 5.30x10^9 Msun. Both DOGs\nexhibit mid-infrared continuum emission that follows a power-law, suggesting\nthat an AGN contributes to the dust heating. As such, estimates of the star\nformation efficiencies in these DOGs are uncertain. A third cluster member with\nan infrared luminosity, L_IR < 7.4x10^11 Lsun, is serendipitously detected in\nCO J=2-1 line emission in the field of one of the DOGs located roughly two\nvirial radii away from the cluster center. The optical spectrum of this object\nsuggests that it is likely an obscured AGN, and the measured CO line luminosity\nis L'_CO = (1.94 +/- 0.35)x10^10 K km/s pc^2, which leads to an estimated cold\nmolecular gas mass M_H_2 = (1.55+/-0.28)x10^10 Msun. A significant reservoir of\nmolecular gas in a z~1 galaxy located away from the cluster center demonstrates\nthat the fuel can exist to drive an increase in star-formation and AGN activity\nat the outskirts of high-redshift clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

This empirical relation holds both for\ngalaxy-wide averages and for individual >=kpc sized patches of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM), but appears to degrade substantially at a sub-kpc scale.\nIdentifying the physical mechanisms that determine the scale-dependent\nproperties of the observed Sigma_H2-Sigma_SFR relation remains a challenge from\na theoretical perspective. To address this question, we analyze the slope and\nscatter of the Sigma_H2-Sigma_SFR relation using a set of cosmological, galaxy\nformation simulations with a peak resolution of ~100 pc. These simulations\ninclude a chemical network for molecular hydrogen, a model for the CO emission,\nand a simple, stochastic prescription for star formation that operates on ~100\npc scales. Specifically, star formation is modeled as a Poisson process in\nwhich the average SFR is directly proportional to the present mass of H2. The\npredictions of our numerical model are in good agreement with the observed\nKennicutt-Schmidt and Sigma_H2-Sigma_SFR relations. We show that observations\nbased on CO emission are ill suited to reliably measure the slope of the latter\nrelation at low (<20 M_sun pc^-2) H2 surface densities on sub-kpc scales. Our\nmodels also predict that the inferred Sigma_H2-Sigma_SFR relation steepens at\nhigh H2 surface densities as a result of the surface density dependence of the\nCO/H2 conversion factor. Finally, we show that on sub-kpc scales most of the\nscatter in the relation is a consequence of discreteness effects in the star\nformation process. In contrast, variations of the CO/H2 conversion factor are\nresponsible for most of the scatter measured on super-kpc scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 20:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

However, observations of well-studied young\nnebulae like the Crab Nebula, 3C 58, and G21.5--0.9 do not show the toroidal\nmagnetic field on a larger scale that might be expected in the MHD flow model;\nin addition, the radial variation of spectral index due to synchrotron losses\nis smoother than expected in the MHD flow model. We find that pure diffusion\nmodels can reproduce the basic data on nebular size and spectral index\nvariation for the Crab, 3C 58, and G21.5--0.9. Most of our models use an energy\nindependent diffusion coefficient; power law variations of the coefficient with\nenergy are degenerate with variation in the input particle energy distribution\nindex in the steady state, transmitting boundary case. Energy dependent\ndiffusion is a possible reason for the smaller diffusion coefficient inferred\nfor the Crab.

The interaction of their wind with the\nISM produces a bow shock. In late evolutionary stages these stars may undergo\nrapid transitions from red to blue and vice versa on the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram, with accompanying rapid changes to their stellar winds and bow shocks.\nRecent 3D simulations of the bow shock produced by the nearby runaway red\nsupergiant (RSG) Betelgeuse, under the assumption of a constant wind, indicate\nthat the bow shock is very young (<30000 years old), hence Betelgeuse may have\nonly recently become a RSG. To test this possibility, we have calculated\nstellar evolution models for single stars which match the observed properties\nof Betelgeuse in the RSG phase. The resulting evolving stellar wind is\nincorporated into 2D hydrodynamic simulations in which we model a runaway blue\nsupergiant (BSG) as it undergoes the transition to a RSG near the end of its\nlife. We find that the collapsing BSG wind bubble induces a bow shock-shaped\ninner shell around the RSG wind that resembles Betelgeuse's bow shock, and has\na similar mass. Surrounding this is the larger-scale retreating bow shock\ngenerated by the now defunct BSG wind's interaction with the ISM.

We have thoroughly\nanalysed the physical structure of a solar metallicity 8.5 solar mass star and\ndescribed the physical conditions at the base of the convective envelope (BCE)\njust prior to divergence.\n  We find that the local opacity maximum caused by M-shell electrons of\nFe-group elements lead to the accumulation of an energy excess, to the\ndeparture of thermal equilibrium conditions at the base of the convective\nenvelope and, eventually, to the divergence of the computed models. For the 8.5\nsolar mass case we present in this work the divergence occurs when the envelope\nmass is about 2 solar mass. The remaining envelope masses range between\nsomewhat less than 1 and more than 2 solar mass for stars with initial masses\nbetween 7 and 10 solar mass and, therefore, our results are relevant for the\nevolution and yields of super-AGB stars. If the envelope is ejected as a\nconsequence of the instability we are considering, the occurrence of\nelectron-capture supernovae would be avoided at solar metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2012 21:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

In Ch2, sample preparation and characterizations are described.\nIn Ch3, by using a self-heating 3-Omega method, the specific heat, thermal\ndiffusivity and thermal conductivity of MWNTs are measured. MWNTs of 20-40 nm\ndiameter show a linear specific heat over a temperature range of 10-300 K,\nsuggesting that inter-wall coupling in MWNTs is rather weak compared with that\nof graphite. The thermal conductivity shows a crossover from linear temperature\ndependence to a square law at ~120K, with a rather low room-temperature\namplitude which may have resulted from structural defects. In Ch4, four-wire\ntunneling spectroscopy of junctions between MWNTs and a normal metal is\nmeasured. The Coulomb interactions in the MWNTs give rise to a strong zero-bias\nsuppression of tunneling density of states that can be fitted numerically with\nthe environmental quantum-fluctuation theory. At low temperatures, an\nasymmetric conductance anomaly near zero bias is observed, which is interpreted\nas Fano resonance in the strong tunneling regime. In Ch5, the thermoelectric\npower (TEP) and longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) of MWNTs are measured. A\nmoderate positive TEP with metallic-like linear temperature dependence is\nfound, suggesting that the electron-hole symmetry in metallic MWNTs is broken.\nPeriodic oscillations in MR are observed at 20 mK when a longitudinal magnetic\nfield is applied. The period of oscillation agrees well with the period h/2e of\nAltshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS) effect if only the outermost graphene wall\ncontributes to conductance, clearly indicating quantum-interference effects at\nlow temperatures.

Further, we compare the finite sample\nperformance of the three classical tests (likelihood ratio, Wald, and score),\nthe gradient test that has been recently proposed by Terrell (2002), and the\nadjusted likelihood ratio test obtained in this paper. Our simulations favor\nthe latter. Applications of our results are presented.

The resulting lags of the tide components are increasing functions of\ntheir frequencies (as in Darwin's theory), but not small quantities. The\namplitudes of the tide components depend on the viscosity of the body and on\ntheir frequencies; they are not constants. The resulting stationary rotations\n(pseudo-synchronous) have an excess velocity roughly proportional to\n$6ne^2/(\\chi^2+1/\\chi^2)$ ($\\chi$ is the mean-motion in units of one critical\nfrequency - the relaxation factor - inversely proportional to the viscosity)\ninstead of the exact $6ne^2$ of standard theories. The dissipation in the\npseudo-synchronous solution is inversely proportional to $(\\chi+1/\\chi)$. In\nthe inviscid limit it is roughly proportional to the frequency (as in standard\ntheories), but that behavior is inverted when the viscosity is high and the\ntide frequency larger than the critical frequency. For free rotating bodies,\nthe dissipation is given by the same law, but now $\\chi$ is the frequency of\nthe semi-diurnal tide in units of the critical frequency.

In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled data is also\nobtained in addition to labeled data. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data is\nimportant to improve the prediction accuracy in semi-supervised learning. This\nproblems is regarded as a semiparametric estimation problem with missing data.\nUnder the the discriminative probabilistic models, it had been considered that\nthe unlabeled data is useless to improve the estimation accuracy.

That's to say, an interaction between two\nindividuals are not uniform, and we can take {\\sigma} as a reaction rate\nbetween any two individuals with the same strategy. We verify this viewpoint by\nthe modified replicator equation with non-uniform interaction rates in a\nsimplified version of the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 03:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-19"}

On the other hand, strong dust ejection anisotropies are\nrequired to fit the near-coma regions at large heliocentric distances (both\ninbound at $r_h$=2.5 AU and outbound at $r_h$=2.6 AU) for the 2002 apparition.\nThese asymmetries are compatible with a scenario where dust ejection is mostly\nseasonally-driven, coming mainly from regions near subsolar latitudes at far\nheliocentric distances inbound and outbound. At intermediate to near-perihelion\nheliocentric distances, the outgassing would affect much more extended latitude\nregions, the emission becoming almost isotropic near perihelion.

In two dimensions, canards result in periodic oscillations\nwhose amplitude and period grow in a highly nonlinear way: they are slowly\nvarying with respect to a control parameter, except for an exponentially small\nrange of values where they grow extremely rapidly. This sudden growth, called a\ncanard explosion, has been encountered in many applications ranging from\nchemistry to neuronal dynamics, aerospace engineering and ecology. Canards were\ninitially studied using nonstandard analysis, and later the same results were\nproved by standard techniques such as matched asymptotics, invariant manifold\ntheory and parameter blow-up. More recently, canard-like behaviour has been\nlinked to surfaces of discontinuity in piecewise-smooth dynamical systems. This\npaper provides a new perspective on the canard phenomenon by showing that the\nnonstandard analysis of canard explosions can be recast into the framework of\npiecewise-smooth dynamical systems. An exponential coordinate scaling is\napplied to a singularly perturbed system of ordinary differential equations.\nThe scaling acts as a lens that resolves dynamics across all time-scales. The\nchanges of local curvature that are responsible for canard explosions are then\nanalysed. Regions where different time-scales dominate are separated by\nhypersurfaces, and these are pinched together to obtain a piecewise-smooth\nsystem, in which curvature changes manifest as discontinuity-induced\nbifurcations. The method is used to classify canards in arbitrary dimensions,\nand to derive the parameter values over which canards form either small cycles\n(canards without head) or large cycles (canards with head).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2012 10:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 09:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

In particular, we consider the maximum clique\nproblem for graphs with small intersection number and random intersection\ngraphs (a model in which each one of $m$ labels is chosen independently with\nprobability $p$ by each one of $n$ vertices, and there are edges between any\nvertices with overlaps in the labels chosen).\n  We first present a simple algorithm which, on input $G$ finds a maximum\nclique in $O(2^{2^m + O(m)} + n^2 \\min\\{2^m, n\\})$ time steps, where $m$ is an\nupper bound on the intersection number and $n$ is the number of vertices.\nConsequently, when $m \\leq \\ln{\\ln{n}}$ the running time of this algorithm is\npolynomial.\n  We then consider random instances of the random intersection graphs model as\ninput graphs. As our main contribution, we prove that, when the number of\nlabels is not too large ($m=n^{\\alpha}, 0< \\alpha <1$), we can use the label\nchoices of the vertices to find a maximum clique in polynomial time whp.

This includes intermediate-mass black holes which are proposed to\nsit at the centers of some massive globular clusters. Today's high angular\nresolution ground based spectrographs allow velocity-dispersion measurements at\na spatial resolution comparable to the radius of influence for plausible IMBH\nmasses, and to detect changes in the inner velocity-dispersion profile.\nTogether with high quality photometric data from HST, it is possible to\nconstrain black-hole masses by their kinematic signatures.

The cost of a\nresource e depends on the number (or load) of players using e, and has to be\npaid completely by the players before it becomes available. Each player i needs\nat least one set of a predefined family S_i in 2^E to be available. Thus,\nresource buying games can be seen as a variant of congestion games in which the\nload-dependent costs of the resources can be shared arbitrarily among the\nplayers. A strategy of player i in resource buying games is a tuple consisting\nof one of i's desired configurations S_i together with a payment vector p_i in\nR^E_+ indicating how much i is willing to contribute towards the purchase of\nthe chosen resources. In this paper, we study the existence and computational\ncomplexity of pure Nash equilibria (PNE, for short) of resource buying games.\nIn contrast to classical congestion games for which equilibria are guaranteed\nto exist, the existence of equilibria in resource buying games strongly depends\non the underlying structure of the S_i's and the behavior of the cost\nfunctions.

Such Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback can account for the\nobserved proportionality between central black hole and host galaxy mass.\nDirect observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback,\nwhich occurs when the AGN is very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is\naccumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio\nmode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when\nthe AGN is operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical\ngalaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the\ncentral galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot\nsurrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot\nintracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by\nan order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived\nheating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a\nfurther mode of energy feedback which affect the cores of groups and\nsubclusters.

I describe several of these ideas from atomic physics,\nincluding optical methods for detecting quantum states of single cold atoms and\natomic ensembles, motional effects within single-atom cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics, and collective optical effects such as superradiant Rayleigh\nscattering and cavity cooling of atomic ensembles. I present several\nexperimental realizations of cavity optomechanics in which an atomic ensemble\nserves as the mechanical element. These are divided between systems driven\neither by sending light onto the cavity input mirrors (\"cavity pumped\"), or by\nsending light onto the atomic ensemble (\"side pumped\").

The extreme isolation of the atomic ensemble from\nmechanical disturbances, and its strong polarizability near the atomic\nresonance frequency, allow these optomechanical systems to be highly sensitive\nto quantum radiation pressure fluctuations.
