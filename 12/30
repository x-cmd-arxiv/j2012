We argue that the removal of the baryonic\ncomponent from gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies, the progenitors of dSphs, can\nsubstantially reduce their central density. Thus, it may play an important role\nin alleviating one of the problems of the CDM model related to the structure of\nrelatively massive satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). Traditionally,\ncollisionless cosmological N-body simulations are used when confronting\ntheoretical predictions with observations. However, these simulations assume\nthat the baryon fraction everywhere in the Universe is equal to the cosmic\nmean, which can be incorrect for dSphs. We find that the combination of (i) the\nlower baryon fraction in dSphs compared to the cosmic mean and (ii) the\nconcentration of baryons in the inner part of the MW halo can go a long way\ntowards explaining the observed circular velocity profiles of dSphs. We find\nthat the blowing away of baryons by ram pressure, when the dwarfs fall into\nlarger galaxies, decreases the circular velocity profile of the satellite and\nreduces the density in the central ~200-500 pc by a factor of (1 - f_b)^4 ~\n0.5, where f_b is the cosmological fraction of baryons. Additionally, the\nenhanced baryonic mass in the central regions of the parent galaxy generates\ntidal forces, which are larger than those experienced by subhaloes in\ntraditional N-body simulations. Increased tidal forces substantially alter\ncircular velocity profiles for satellites with pericentres less than 50 kpc. We\nshow that these two effects are strong enough to bring the predictions of\nsubhaloes from CDM simulations into agreement with the observed structure of MW\ndSphs, regardless of the details of the baryonic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2012 18:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2013 18:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The X-ray emission from the pulsar is consistent with a\nmagnetospheric non-thermal origin plus a thermal emission from a hot spot (or\nhot spots). The lack of a thermal component from the whole surface makes Morla\nthe coldest neutron star in its age range. We found marginal evidence for a\ndouble-peaked modulation of the X-ray emission. The study of the 9'-long tail\nconfirmed the lack of extended emission near the pulsar itself. The tail shows\na very asymmetric brightness profile and its spectrum lacks any spatial\nvariation. We found the nebular emission to be inconsistent with a classical\nbow-shock, ram-pressure dominated pulsar wind nebula. We propose thermal\nbremsstrahlung as an alternative mechanism for Morla's tail emission. In this\nscenario, the tail emission comes from the shocked interstellar medium (ISM)\nmaterial heated up to X-ray temperatures. This can fully explain the peculiar\nfeatures of the tail, assuming a hot, moderately dense interstellar medium\naround the pulsar. For a bremsstrahlung-emitting tail, we can estimate the\npulsar distance to be between 300 and 900 pc. A pulsar velocity of about 1900\nkm/s is required - which would make Morla the pulsar with the largest velocity\n- and high inclination angles (>70 degrees) are preferred. We propose Morla's\nnebula as the first example of a new \"turtle's tail\" class of\nthermally-emitting nebulae associated to high velocity pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2012 21:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

When the many-body energy scale (e.g. the\nFermi energy, $E_{F}$) is larger than $\\delta_c$, the closed-channel weight is\nsignificant and has to be included in the many-body theory. Furthermore, when\ntwo channels share a hyperfine species, the Pauli exclusion between fermions\nfrom two channels also needs to be taken into consideration in the many-body\ntheory.\n  The current thesis addresses the above problem in detail. A set of gap\nequations and number equations are derived at the mean-field level. The\nfermionic and bosonic excitation spectra are then derived. Assuming that the\nuncoupled bound-state of the closed-channel in resonance is much smaller than\nthe inter-particle distance, as well as the s-wave scattering length, $a_s$, we\nfind that the basic equations in the single-channel crossover model are still\nvalid. The correction first comes from the existing of the finite chemical\npotential and additional counting complication due to the closed-channel. These\ntwo corrections need to be included into the mean-field equations, i.e. the gap\nequations and the number equations, and be solved self-consistently. Then the\ncorrection due to the inter-channel Pauli exclusion is in the order of the\nratio of the Fermi energy and the Zeeman energy difference between two\nchannels, $E_F/\\eta$, which can be analyzed perturbatively over the previous\ncorrections.\n  Fermionic and bosonic excitation modes are studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2012 06:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

In order to demonstrate the flexibility and the capabilities of\nthe approach, several applications are presented: the classical wedge entry\nproblem, which is also used for a validation of the approach, the block sliding\nalong an inclined sea bed, the vertical water entry of a flat plate and the\nditching of an inclined plate. The solution procedure is also applied to cases\nin which the body surface is either porous or perforated. Comparisons with\nnumerical or experimental data available in literature are presented for the\npurpose of validation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2012 10:36:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2013 22:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}

If it is\nset within its classical mechanics roots, it is clear that it is a restricted\nform of a Lagrangian.\n  In advanced texts on fracture cracks are treated as dynamic entities, and the\nrole of stress waves is clearly articulated. However, in most non-advanced\ntexts on fracture and fatigue the role of stress waves are either not included\nor not emphasised, often leading to a possible misunderstanding of the\nfundamentals of fracture.\n  What is done here is to extend Griffiths approach by setting it within the\nconcept of Stationary Action, and introducing a quasi-static stress wave\nunloading model, which connects the energy release mechanism with the stress\nfield. This leads to a definition of a dynamic stress intensity factor, and\nthis model is then applied to fatigue of perfectly elastic and elastic-plastic\nmaterials to include crack tip plasticity.\n  The results for the Griffiths crack and the dynamic case are retrodiction, to\nestablish the validity of the methods used. The extension to fatigue gives\nsignificant new results, which show that for elastic-plastic materials the\ninfluence of the maximum stress in the cycle as a fraction of the yield stress,\ncalled the yield stress ratio, has not been recognised. The new form of the\nfatigue crack growth relationship derived answers many of the long standing\nquestions about the Paris Law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2012 12:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 20:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

Often,\nthese systems have metastable regions or phases, prohibiting to estimate the\nstationary probabilities by direct simulation. Efficient sampling methods such\nas umbrella sampling, metadynamics and conformational flooding have developed\nthat perform a number of simulations where the system's potential is biased\nsuch as to accelerate the rare barrier crossing events. A joint free energy\nprofile or stationary density can then be obtained from these biased\nsimulations with weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM).

We perform forward-type\nmagnetohydrodynamical numerical experiments for Alfven wave-driven stellar\nwinds with a wide range of the input Poynting flux from the photosphere.\nIncreasing the magnetic field strength and the turbulent velocity at the\nstellar photosphere from the current solar level, the mass loss rate rapidly\nincreases at first owing to the suppression of the reflection of the Alfven\nwaves. The surface materials are lifted up by the magnetic pressure associated\nwith the Alfven waves, and the cool dense chromosphere is intermittently\nextended to 10 -- 20 % of the stellar radius. The dense atmospheres enhance the\nradiative losses and eventually most of the input Poynting energy from the\nstellar surface escapes by the radiation. As a result, there is no more\nsufficient energy remained for the kinetic energy of the wind; the stellar wind\nsaturates in very active stars, as observed in Wood et al. The saturation level\nis positively correlated with B_{r,0}f_0, where B_{r,0} and f_0 are the\nmagnetic field strength and the filling factor of open flux tubes at the\nphotosphere. If B_{r,0}f_0 is relatively large >~ 5 G, the mass loss rate could\nbe as high as 1000 times. If such a strong mass loss lasts for ~ 1 billion\nyears, the stellar mass itself is affected, which could be a solution to the\nfaint young sun paradox.

The q-insertion algorithm is `randomised', or `quantum', in\nthe sense that when inserting a positive integer into a tableau, the output is\na distribution of weights on a particular set of tableaux which includes the\noutput which would have been obtained via the usual column insertion algorithm.\nThere is also a notion of recording tableau in this setting. We show that the\ndistribution of weights of the pair of tableaux obtained when one applies the\nq-insertion algorithm to a random word or permutation takes a particularly\nsimple form and is closely related to q-Whittaker functions. In the case $0\\le\nq<1$, the q-insertion algorithm applied to a random word also provides a new\nframework for solving the q-TASEP interacting particle system introduced (in\nthe language of q-bosons) by Sasamoto and Wadati (1998) and yields formulas\nwhich are equivalent to some of those recently obtained by Borodin and Corwin\n(2011) via a stochastic evolution on discrete Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns (or\nsemistandard tableaux) which is coupled to the q-TASEP process.

We evolve these isolated galaxy models using\nthe GADGET-3 $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation code, paying particular attention\nto the effects of the gas halo on the evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthe models is strongly affected by the adopted gas halo component. The model\nwithout a gas halo shows an increasing star formation rate (SFR) at the\nbeginning of the simulation for some hundreds of millions of years and then a\ncontinuously decreasing rate to the end of the run at 3 Gyr. On the other hand,\nthe SFRs in the models with a gas halo emerge to be either relatively flat\nthroughout the simulations or increasing over a gigayear and then decreasing to\nthe end. The models with the more centrally concentrated NFW gas halo show\noverall higher SFRs than those with the isothermal gas halo of the equal mass.\nThe gas accretion from the halo onto the disk also occurs more in the models\nwith the NFW gas halo, however, this is shown to take place mostly in the inner\npart of the disk and not to contribute significantly to the star formation\nunless the gas halo has very high density at the central part. The rotation of\na gas halo is found to make SFR lower in the model. The SFRs in the runs\nincluding galactic winds are found to be lower than the same runs but without\nwinds.

On one hand,\nthe association leads us to interpret the nonlocality with locally symmetric\nmethod. On the other hand, we find that the nonlocal interaction between\nhadrons could be test ground for scaling transformation if ascribing the\nrunning effects in renormalization to scaling transformation. First we derive\ndirectly from group theory the operator/coordinate representation and\nunitary/spinor representation for scaling transformation, then link them\ntogether by inquiring a scaling-invariant interaction vertex mimicking the\nsimilar process of Lorentz transformation applied to Dirac equation. The main\nfeature of this paper is that we discuss both the representations in a sole\nphysical frame. The representations correspond respectively to the spatial\nfreedom and the intrinsic freedom of the same quantum system. And the latter is\nrecognized to contribute to spin angular momentum that in literature has never\nbeen considered seriously. The nonlocal interaction Lagrangian turns out to\nvary under scaling transformation, analogous to running cases in\nrenormalization. And the total Lagrangian becomes scale invariant only under\nsome extreme conditions. The conservation law of this extreme Lagrangian is\ndiscussed and a contribution named scalum appears to the spin angular momentum.\nFinally a mechanism is designed to test the scaling effect on nonlocal\ninteraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2012 03:14:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2013 02:21:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 06:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

VQS believes that since mass\nis a scalar, it cannot depend upon speed and has to be the same in all inertial\ncoordinate frames. In his view, the very idea of speed dependence of the mass\nof a particle or a body is incorrect and misleading. As such, the notion of\nspeed dependence of a particle mass has to be eliminated from textbooks on\nphysics and from teaching of this subject. The author claims that this notion\nhas the right to exist, is easily understandable and convenient for most of the\nstudents, both non physicists and even physicist.
