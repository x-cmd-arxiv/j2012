In other words, the ground state of 11Li can be viewed as a\nneutron Cooper pair bound to the 9Li core, mainly through the exchange of\ncollective vibration of the core and of the pigmy resonance arizing from the\nsloshing back and forth of the neutron halo against the protons of the core,\nthe mean field leading to unbound two particle states, a situation essentially\nnot altered by the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction acting between the halo\nneutrons. Two-neutron pick-up data, together with (t,p) data on 7Li, suggest\nthe existence of a pairing vibrational band based on 9Li, whose members can be\nexcited with the help of inverse kinematic experiments as was done in the case\nof 11Li(p,t)9Li reaction. The deviation from harmonicity can provide insight\ninto the workings of medium polarization effects on Cooper pair nuclear\npairing, let alone specific information concering the \"rigidity\" of the N=6\nshell closure.

The 0.33-50 keV spectrum is described by\nthe sum of a hard Comptonized component originated in an optically thin\n{\\tau}~1 corona, a soft kTin~0.2 keV component interpreted as accretion disc\nemission, and of disc reflection of the hard component. Two emission features\nare detected at energies of 0.98(1) and 6.58(7) keV, respectively. The latter\nis identified as K{\\alpha} transition of Fe XXIII-XXV. A simultaneous detection\nin EPIC-pn, EPIC-MOS2, and RGS spectra favours an astrophysical origin also for\nthe former, which has an energy compatible with Fe-L{\\alpha} and helium-like\nNe-K{\\alpha} transitions. Broadness of the two features suggests a common\norigin, resulting from reflection in an accretion disc with inclination of\n(30+4{\\deg}), and extending down to Rin=25(+16,-11) gravitational radii from\nthe compact object. However, the strength of the feature at lower energy\nmeasured by EPIC-pn cannot be entirely reconciled with the amplitude of the Fe\nK{\\alpha} line, hampering the possibility of describing it in terms of a\nbroad-band reflection model, and preventing a firm identification.

We interpret the inner\ndisc radius estimated from spectral modelling and the lack of significant\ndetection of coherent X-ray pulsations as an indication of a disc accretion\nflow truncated by some mechanism connected to the overall evolution of the\naccretion disc, rather than by the neutron star magnetic field. This is\ncompatible with the extremely close similarity of spectral and temporal\nproperties of this source with respect to other, non pulsing atoll sources in\nthe hard state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Both schemes are built from a polar\ncoding construction capable of transmitting classical information over a\nquantum channel [Wilde and Guha, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, in\npress]. Appropriately merging two such classical-quantum schemes, one for\ntransmitting \"amplitude\" information and the other for transmitting \"phase,\"\nleads to the new private and quantum coding schemes, similar to the\nconstruction for Pauli and erasure channels in [Renes, Dupuis, and Renner,\nPhysical Review Letters 109, 050504 (2012)]. The encoding is entirely similar\nto the classical case, and thus efficient. The decoding can also be performed\nby successive cancellation, as in the classical case, but no efficient\nsuccessive cancellation scheme is yet known for arbitrary quantum channels. An\nefficient code construction is unfortunately still unknown. Generally, our two\ncoding schemes require entanglement or secret-key assistance, respectively, but\nwe extend two known conditions under which the needed assistance rate vanishes.\nFinally, although our results are formulated for qubit channels, we show how\nthe scheme can be extended to multiple qubits. This then demonstrates a\nnear-explicit coding method for realizing one of the most striking phenomena in\nquantum information theory: the superactivation effect, whereby two quantum\nchannels which individually have zero quantum capacity can have a non-zero\nquantum capacity when used together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

Assuming the users learn their direct and interfering\nchannels perfectly, they can feed back this information to the base stations\n(BSs) over the uplink channels. The BSs then use the channel information to\ndesign their transmission scheme. Two types of feedback are considered: analog\nand digital. In the analog feedback case, the users send their unquantized and\nuncoded CSI over the uplink channels. In this context, given a user's fixed\ntransmit power, we investigate how he/she should optimally allocate it to feed\nback the direct and interfering (or cross) CSI for two types of base station\ncooperation schemes, namely, Multi-Cell Processing (MCP) and Coordinated\nBeamforming (CBf). In the digital feedback case, the direct and cross link\nchannel vectors of each user are quantized separately, each using RVQ, with\ndifferent size codebooks. The users then send the index of the quantization\nvector in the corresponding codebook to the BSs. Similar to the feedback\noptimization problem in the analog feedback, we investigate the optimal bit\npartitioning for the direct and interfering link for both types of cooperation.\nWe focus on regularized channel inversion precoding structures and perform our\nanalysis in the large system limit in which the number of users per cell ($K$)\nand the number of antennas per BS ($N$) tend to infinity with their ratio\n$\\beta=\\frac{K}{N}$ held fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}

We also compare for the first time\nthe predicted CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) and gas properties\nof our molecular gas-rich ETGs with those of a sample of nearby well-studied\ndisc galaxies. The gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 ETGs appear\nanalogous to those in the centre of the Milky Way. Such results have never been\nobtained before for ETGs and open a new window to explore further\nstar-formation processes in the Universe. The conclusions drawn should\nnevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number of\nobservations and on a simple model. In the near future, with higher CO\ntransition observations, it should be possible to better identify the various\ngas components present in ETGs, as well as more precisely determine their\nassociated physical conditions. To achieve these goals, we show here from our\ntheoretical study, that mid-J CO lines (such as the $^{12}$CO(6-5) line) are\nparticularly useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Such models have\nlow electroweak fine-tuning and satisfy the LHC constraints.

The RNS model can be generated from SUSY GUT\ntype models with non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM).

This view is described, for example, by the\nmetaphor of the spread of a population across a neutral network in genotype\nspace. As an alternative view, consider the fact that most phenotypic traits\nare affected by multiple sequences, including cryptic ones. Even in a strictly\nclonal population, the co-option of cryptic sequences at different loci may\nhave different phenotypic effects and offer the population multiple adaptive\npossibilities.

Moreover, in the PI\nformulation the holonomy of the induced gauge potential is related to\nSchlesinger's exact formula for the gauge field tensor. A superadiabatic\nexpansion is also constructed, and a generalized Dykhne formula, depending on\nthe contour integrals of the homotopy class of complex degenerate points, is\nrephrased in the PI formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 00:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2013 12:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This\nreview focuses on metal-insulator transition mechanisms in correlated electron\nmaterials and three-terminal field effect devices utilizing such correlated\noxides as the channel layer. We first describe how electron-disorder\ninteraction, electron-phonon interaction and/or electron correlation in solids\ncould modify the electronic properties of materials and lead to metal-insulator\ntransitions.

We then briefly review unconventional\nelectrostatic gating techniques, such as ionic liquid gating and ferroelectric\ngating, which enables ultra large carrier accumulation density in the\ncorrelated materials which could in turn lead to phase transitions.

The presence of skin or\nnon-skin in digital image can be determined by manipulating pixels colour or\npixels texture. The main problem in skin colour detection is to represent the\nskin colour distribution model that is invariant or least sensitive to changes\nin illumination condition. Another problem comes from the fact that many\nobjects in the real world may possess almost similar skin-tone colour such as\nwood, leather, skin-coloured clothing, hair and sand. Moreover, skin colour is\ndifferent between races and can be different from a person to another, even\nwith people of the same ethnicity. Finally, skin colour will appear a little\ndifferent when different types of camera are used to capture the object or\nscene.

We show that the general tensor PCA problem is reducible to its\nspecial case where the tensor in question is super-symmetric with an even\ndegree. In that case, the tensor can be embedded into a symmetric matrix. We\nprove that if the tensor is rank-one, then the embedded matrix must be rank-one\ntoo, and vice versa. The tensor PCA problem can thus be solved by means of\nmatrix optimization under a rank-one constraint, for which we propose two\nsolution methods: (1) imposing a nuclear norm penalty in the objective to\nenforce a low-rank solution; (2) relaxing the rank-one constraint by\nSemidefinite Programming. Interestingly, our experiments show that both methods\nyield a rank-one solution with high probability, thereby solving the original\ntensor PCA problem to optimality with high probability. To further cope with\nthe size of the resulting convex optimization models, we propose to use the\nalternating direction method of multipliers, which reduces significantly the\ncomputational efforts. Various extensions of the model are considered as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 04:27:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2013 14:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-19"}

In group oriented applications such as Video conferencing\nand entertainment applications, it is necessary to secure the confidential data\nin such a way that intruders are not able to modify or transmit the data. Key\ntransfer protocols fully rely on trusted Key Generation Center (KGC) to compute\ngroup key and to transport the group keys to all communication parties in a\nsecured and secret manner. In this paper, an efficient key generation and key\ntransfer protocol has been proposed where KGC can broadcast group key\ninformation to all group members in a secure way. Hence, only authorized group\nmembers will be able to retrieve the secret key and unauthorized members cannot\nretrieve the secret key. Hence, inorder to maintain the forward and backward\nsecrecy, the group keys are updated whenever a new member joins or leaves the\ncommunication group. The proposed algorithm is more efficient and relies on NP\nclass. In addition, the keys are distributed to the group users in a safe and\nsecure way. Moreover, the key generated is also very strong since it uses\ncryptographic techniques which provide efficient computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 07:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-13"}

In the outer gap model, most pairs inside the gap\nare created around the null charge surface and the gap's electric field\nseparates the two charges to move in opposite directions. Consequently, the\nregion from the null charge surface to the light cylinder is dominated by the\noutflow current while that from the null charge surface to the star is\ndominated by the inflow current. We suggest that the viewing angle of PSR\nB1509-58 only receives the inflow radiation. The incoming curvature photons are\nconverted to pairs by the strong magnetic field of the star. The X-rays and\nsoft gamma-rays of PSR B1509-58 result from the synchrotron radiation of these\npairs. Magnetic pair creation requires a large pitch angle, which makes the\npulse profile of the synchrotron radiation distinct from that of the curvature\nradiation. We carefully trace the pulse profiles of the synchrotron radiation\nwith different pitch angles. We find that the differences between the light\ncurves of different energy bands are due to the different pitch angles of the\nsecondary pairs, and that the second peak appearing at E>10MeV comes from the\nregion near the star, where the stronger magnetic field allows pair creation to\nhappen with a smaller pitch angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We implemented two\nalternative schemes to treat the transport of the angular momentum: the\nadvection-diffusion formalism and the simpler purely diffusive one.

Also the C abundance left by the He burning is\nlower than in the non rotating case, especially for stars of initial mass 13-25\n\\msun, and this affects the final Mass-Radius relation, basically the final\nbinding energy, at the presupernova stage. The elemental yields produced by a\ngeneration of stars rotating initially at 300 km/s do not change substantially\nwith respect to those produced by a generation of non rotating massive stars,\nthe main differences being a slight overproduction of the weak s-component and\na larger production of F. Since rotation also affects the mass loss rate,\neither directly and indirectly, we find substantial differences in the\nlifetimes as O-type and WR-subtypes between rotating and non rotating models.\nThe maximum mass exploding as type IIP supernova ranges between 15 and 20\\msun\nin both sets of models (this value depending basically on the larger mass loss\nrates in the Red Super Giant phase due to the inclusion of the dust driven\nwind). This limiting value is in remarkable good agreement with current\nestimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 10:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-13"}

Hydraulic\nstimulation of existing fracture networks has been successfully achieved for\nunconventional geothermal resources. More recently proposed concepts increase\nthe use of drilled wellbores in hard rock to connect the injection and\nproduction wells. The present work investigates the long-term thermal effects\nof deviated geothermal wellbores and studies how the cooling of the borehole\nwall results in thermally induced tensile fractures. The results show that\ninduced fractures are created by a combination of in situ and thermal stresses,\nand that the extent to which thermally induced tensile wall fractures are\ncreated largely depends on how the wellbores are oriented with respect to the\npre-existing stresses of the reservoir. If the system is not optimized with\nrespect to in situ stresses, the risk of wellbore instability becomes severe\nwithin less than a year of production. In contrast, if the orientation of the\nwellbores is optimized, thermally induced instabilities can be completely\nexcluded as potential risks for the operational lifetime of the system.\nFurthermore, our results show that the thermal failure process strongly depends\non the temperature of the injected water but is only weakly affected by the\ninjection rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 10:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-13"}

We\nperformed pure 3D gas dynamic simulations of the plasma interaction between\nWASP-12b and its host star, and describe the flow pattern in the system. In\nparticular, we show that the overfilling of the planet's Roche lobe leads to a\nnoticeable outflow from the upper atmosphere in the direction of the L1 and L2\npoints. Due to the conservation of the angular momentum, the flow to the L1\npoint is deflected in the direction of the planet's orbital motion, while the\nflow towards L2 is deflected in the opposite direction, resulting in a\nnon-axisymmetric envelope, surrounding the planet. The supersonic motion of the\nplanet inside the stellar wind leads to the formation of a bow shock with a\ncomplex shape. The existence of the bow shock slows down the outflow through\nthe L1 and L2 points, allowing us to consider a long-living flow structure\nwhich is in the steady-state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 11:39:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 08:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We systematically investigate the move-by-move\ndynamics of the white player's advantage from over seventy thousand high level\nchess matches spanning over 150 years. We find that the average advantage of\nthe white player is positive and that it has been increasing over time.\nCurrently, the average advantage of the white player is ~0.17 pawns but it is\nexponentially approaching a value of 0.23 pawns with a characteristic time\nscale of 67 years. We also study the diffusion of the move dependence of the\nwhite player's advantage and find that it is non-Gaussian, has long-ranged\nanti-correlations and that after an initial period with no diffusion it becomes\nsuper-diffusive. We find that the duration of the non-diffusive period,\ncorresponding to the opening stage of a match, is increasing in length and\nexponentially approaching a value of 15.6 moves with a characteristic time\nscale of 130 years.

ASTROD-GW is an\noptimization of ASTROD which focuses on low frequency gravitational wave\ndetection. The detection sensitivity is shifted by a factor of 260 (52) towards\nlonger wavelengths compared with that of NGO/eLISA (LISA). The mission consists\nof three spacecraft, each of which orbits near one of the Sun-Earth Lagrange\npoints (L3, L4 and L5), such that the array forms an almost equilateral\ntriangle. The 3 spacecraft range interferometrically with one another with an\narm length of about 260 million kilometers. The orbits have been optimized\nresulting in arm length changes of less than 0.00015 AU or, fractionally, less\nthan 10^(-4) in twenty years, and relative Doppler velocities of the three\nspacecraft of less than 3 m/s.

Though increased residue-flexibility was preferred in\nthe early stages of protein structure evolution, less flexibility is preferred\nin the medieval and recent stages. GLU is found to be the most flexible residue\nwhile VAL recorded to have the least flexibility. General trends in decrement\nof B-Factors conformed to the general trend in the order of emergence of\nprotein structural domains. Decrement of B-Factor is observed to be most\ndecisive (monotonic and uniform) for VAL, while evolution of CYS and LYS\nflexibility is found to be most skewed. Barring CYS, flexibility of all the\nresidues is found to have increased during evolution of alpha by beta folds,\nhowever flexibility of all the residues (barring CYS) is found to have\ndecreased during evolution of all beta folds. Only in alpha by beta folds the\ntendency of preferring higher residue mobility could be observed, neither alpha\nplus beta, nor all alpha nor all beta folds were found to support higher\nresidue-mobility. In all the structural classes, the effect of evolutionary\nconstraint on polar residues is found to follow an exactly identical trend as\nthat on hydrophobic residues, only the extent of these effects are found to be\ndifferent. Though protein size is found to be decreasing during evolution,\nresidue mobility of proteins belonging to ancient and old structural domains\nshowed strong positive dependency upon protein size, however for medieval and\nrecent domains such dependency vanished.

This is in stark contrast with the productivity-fueled growth that was\nseen in the 1950s and 1960s. This transition, starting in the early 1980s, was\nfurther supported by a climate of deregulation and a massive growth in\nfinancial derivatives designed to spread and diversify the risks globally.

This model, a discrete-time and causal\nunitary evolution of a lattice of quantum systems, is derived from the\nassumptions of homogeneity, parity and time-reversal invariance. The comparison\nbetween the automaton and the Dirac evolutions is rigorously set as a\ndiscrimination problem between unitary channels. We derive an exact lower bound\nfor the probability of error in the discrimination as an explicit function of\nthe mass, the number and the momentum of the particles, and the duration of the\nevolution. Computing this bound with experimentally achievable values, we see\nthat in that regime the QCA model cannot be discriminated from the usual Dirac\nevolution. Finally, we show that the evolution of one-particle states with\nnarrow-band in momentum can be effi- ciently simulated by a dispersive\ndifferential equation for any regime. This analysis allows for a comparison\nwith the dynamics of wave-packets as it is described by the usual Dirac\nequation.

In this\nregime the accreting matter settles down subsonically onto the rotating\nmagnetosphere, forming an extended quasi-static shell. The shell mediates the\nangular momentum removal from the rotating NS magnetosphere by shear turbulent\nviscosity in the boundary layer or via large-scale convective motions. In the\nlast case the differential rotation law in the shell is close to\niso-angular-momentum rotation. The accretion rate through the shell is\ndetermined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities while taking cooling into account. Measurements\nof spin-up/spin-down rates of quasi-spherically wind accreting XPSRs in\nequilibrium with known orbital periods (like e.g. GX 301-2 and Vela X-1) enable\ndetermination of the main dimensionless parameters of the model and the NS\nmagnetic field. For equilibrium pulsars with independent measurements of the\nmagnetic field, the stellar wind velocity from the companion can be estimated\nwithout the use of complicated spectroscopic measurements.

From observations of the spin-down rate and X-ray luminosity in such\npulsars (GX 1+4, SXP 1062, 4U 2206+54, etc.) a lower limit on the NS magnetic\nfield is derived, which in all cases turns out to be close to the standard one\nand in agreement with cyclotron line measurements.

In\ncases where all clusterings to be compared have the same number of clusters,\nthe measure is equivalent to the mutual information between the cluster labels\nand the class labels. In cases where the numbers of clusters are different,\nhowever, it computes the reduction in the number of bits that would be required\nto encode (compress) the class labels if both the encoder and decoder have free\nacccess to the cluster labels. To achieve this encoding the estimated\nconditional probabilities of the class labels given the cluster labels must\nalso be encoded.

In this paper, we study clustering with respect the\nemph{k-median} objective function, a natural formulation of clustering in which\nwe attempt to minimize the average distance to cluster centers. One of the main\ncontributions of this paper is a simple but powerful sampling technique that we\ncall emph{successive sampling} that could be of independent interest. We show\nthat our sampling procedure can rapidly identify a small set of points (of size\njust O(klog{n/k})) that summarize the input points for the purpose of\nclustering. Using successive sampling, we develop an algorithm for the k-median\nproblem that runs in O(nk) time for a wide range of values of k and is\nguaranteed, with high probability, to return a solution with cost at most a\nconstant factor times optimal. We also establish a lower bound of Omega(nk) on\nany randomized constant-factor approximation algorithm for the k-median problem\nthat succeeds with even a negligible (say 1/100) probability. Thus we establish\na tight time bound of Theta(nk) for the k-median problem for a wide range of\nvalues of k. The best previous upper bound for the problem was O(nk), where the\nO-notation hides polylogarithmic factors in n and k. The best previous lower\nbound of O(nk) applied only to deterministic k-median algorithms. While we\nfocus our presentation on the k-median objective, all our upper bounds are\nvalid for the k-means objective as well. In this context our algorithm compares\nfavorably to the widely used k-means heuristic, which requires O(nk) time for\njust one iteration and provides no useful approximation guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 15:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-07"}

More recently, researchers\nhave begun exploiting structural properties of robotic domains that have led to\nsuccessful particle filter applications in spaces with as many as 100,000\ndimensions.

We introduce a new class of upper bounds on the log\npartition function, based on convex combinations of distributions in the\nexponential domain, that is applicable to an arbitrary undirected graphical\nmodel. In the special case of convex combinations of tree-structured\ndistributions, we obtain a family of variational problems, similar to the Bethe\nfree energy, but distinguished by the following desirable properties: i. they\nare cnvex, and have a unique global minimum; and ii. the global minimum gives\nan upper bound on the log partition function. The global minimum is defined by\nstationary conditions very similar to those defining fixed points of belief\npropagation or tree-based reparameterization Wainwright et al., 2001. As with\nBP fixed points, the elements of the minimizing argument can be used as\napproximations to the marginals of the original model. The analysis described\nhere can be extended to structures of higher treewidth e.g., hypertrees,\nthereby making connections with more advanced approximations e.g., Kikuchi and\nvariants Yedidia et al., 2001; Minka, 2001.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 15:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-07"}
