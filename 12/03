(2000). The observed relative intensities are compared with the\ntheoretical predictions based on high quality effective recombination\ncoefficients, now available for the recombination line spectrum of a number of\nheavy element ions. The possibility of plasma diagnostics using the optical\nrecombination lines (ORLs) of heavy element ions is discussed in detail. Plasma\ndiagnostics based on the N II and O II recombination spectra both yield\nelectron temperatures close to 1000 K, which is lower than those derived from\nthe collisionally excited line (CEL) ratios by nearly one order of magnitude.\nThe very low temperatures yielded by the O II and N II ORLs indicate that they\noriginate from very cold regions. The C^{2+}/H^+, N^{2+}/H^+, O^{2+}/H^+ and\nNe^{2+}/H^+ ionic abundance ratios derived from ORLs are consistently higher,\nby about a factor of 5, than the corresponding values derived from CELs. In\ncalculating the ORL ionic abundance ratios, we have used the newly available\nhigh quality effective recombination coefficients, and adopted an electron\ntemperature of 1000 K, as given by the ORL diagnostics and as a consequence\npresumably representing the physical conditions prevailing in the regions where\nthe heavy element ORLs arise. A comparison of the results of plasma diagnostics\nand abundance determinations for NGC 7009 points to the existence of \"cold\",\nmetal-rich (i.e. H-deficient) inclusions embedded in the hot, diffuse ionized\ngas, first postulated by Liu et al.

In the paper we present a general\nframework for constructing high order interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin\n(IP-DG) methods for approximating viscosity solutions of these fully nonlinear\nPDEs. In order to capture discontinuities of the second order derivative\n$u_{xx}$ of the solution $u$, three independent functions $p_1, p_2$ and $p_3$\nare introduced to represent numerical derivatives using various one-sided\nlimits. The proposed DG framework, which is based on a nonstandard mixed\nformulation of the underlying PDE, embeds a nonlinear problem into a mostly\nlinear system of equations where the nonlinearity has been modified to include\nmultiple values of the second order derivative $u_{xx}$. The proposed framework\nextends a companion finite difference framework developed by the authors in [9]\nand allows for the approximation of fully nonlinear PDEs using high order\npolynomials and non-uniform meshes.In addition to the nonstandard mixed\nformulation setting, another main idea is to replace the fully nonlinear\ndifferential operator by a numerical operator, which is consistent with the\ndifferential operator and satisfies certain monotonicity (called\ng-monotonicity) properties. To ensure such a g-monotonicity, the crux of the\nconstruction is to introduce the numerical moment, which plays a critical role\nin the proposed DG framework. This paper also presents and analyzes numerical\nresults for several numerical test problems which are used to guage the\naccuracy and efficiency of the proposed DG methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2012 23:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

These\nclusters are specifically selected to lack significant substructure at bright\nlimits in their central regions so that we are largely able to eliminate the\nlocal action of merging clusters on the frequency of AGN. We demonstrate that\nthe AGN fraction increases significantly from the cluster centre to 1.5Rvirial,\nbut tails off at larger radii. If only comparing the cluster core region to\nregions at ~2Rvirial, no significant variation would be found. We compute the\nAGN fraction by mass and show that massive galaxies (log(stellar mass)>10.7)\nare host to a systematically higher fraction of AGN than lower mass galaxies at\nall radii from the cluster centre. We attribute this deficit of AGN in the\ncluster centre to the changing mix of galaxy types with radius. We use the WHAN\ndiagnostic to separate weak AGN from `retired' galaxies in which the main\nionization mechanism comes from old stellar populations. These retired AGN are\nfound at all radii, while the mass effect is much more pronounced: we find that\nmassive galaxies are more likely to be in the retired class. Further, we show\nthat our AGN have no special position inside galaxy clusters - they are neither\npreferentially located in the infall regions, nor situated at local maxima of\ngalaxy density. However, we find that the most powerful AGN (with [OIII]\nequivalent widths <-10Ang) reside at significant velocity offsets in the\ncluster, and this brings our analysis into agreement with previous work on\nX-ray selected AGN. Our results suggest that if interactions with other\ngalaxies are responsible for triggering AGN activity, the time-lag between\ntrigger and AGN enhancement must be sufficiently long to obfuscate the\nencounter site and wipe out the local galaxy density signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 00:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Holographic duality provides a systematic new approach to studying\nquantum turbulence by mapping the dynamics of certain quantum theories onto the\ndynamics of classical gravity. We use this gravitational description to\nnumerically construct turbulent flows in a holographic superfluid in two\nspatial dimensions. We find that the superfluid kinetic energy spectrum obeys\nthe Kolmogorov -5/3 scaling law, as it does for turbulent flows in normal\nfluids. We trace this scaling to a direct energy cascade by injecting energy at\nlong wavelengths and watching it flow to a short-distance scale set by the\nvortex core size, where dissipation by vortex annihilation and vortex drag\nbecomes efficient. This is in sharp contrast with the inverse energy cascade of\nnormal fluid turbulence in two dimensions. We also demonstrate that the\nmicroscopic dissipation spectrum has a simple geometric interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 04:09:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 20:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-20"}

In this paper, we proposed an image based\npreprocessing technique to enhance the quality of the underwater images. The\nproposed technique comprises a combination of four filters such as homomorphic\nfiltering, wavelet denoising, bilateral filter and contrast equalization. These\nfilters are applied sequentially on degraded underwater images. The literature\nsurvey reveals that image based preprocessing algorithms uses standard filter\ntechniques with various combinations. For smoothing the image, the image based\npreprocessing algorithms uses the anisotropic filter. The main drawback of the\nanisotropic filter is that iterative in nature and computation time is high\ncompared to bilateral filter. In the proposed technique, in addition to other\nthree filters, we employ a bilateral filter for smoothing the image. The\nexperimentation is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, we have\nconducted various experiments on captured images and estimated optimal\nparameters for bilateral filter. Similarly, optimal filter bank and optimal\nwavelet shrinkage function are estimated for wavelet denoising. In the second\nstage, we conducted the experiments using estimated optimal parameters, optimal\nfilter bank and optimal wavelet shrinkage function for evaluating the proposed\ntechnique. We evaluated the technique using quantitative based criteria such as\na gradient magnitude histogram and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). Further,\nthe results are qualitatively evaluated based on edge detection results. The\nproposed technique enhances the quality of the underwater images and can be\nemployed prior to apply computer vision techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 05:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

We detect clear signatures of the enhancement of the\nextinction in r-band, $\\Delta A_r$, around galaxies, indicating that the\nextinction map is contaminated by their FIR (far infrared) emission.

In this paper, UP Tree (Utility Pattern Tree) is adopted,\nwhich scans database only twice to obtain candidate items and manage them in an\nefficient data structured way. Applying UP Tree to the UP Growth takes more\nexecution time for Phase II. Hence this paper presents modified algorithm\naiming to reduce the execution time by effectively identifying high utility\nitemsets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 08:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

This strongly contrasts to other mode-couplings at higher\nbinding-energies (~20, ~40, and ~70 meV) with almost no doping variation in\nenergy scale.

Starting from the\nEinstein-Hilbert action coupled to a Lagrangian density that contains two\ncomponents - one corresponding to a scalar field Lagrangian,\n${\\mathcal{L}}_{\\phi}$, and another that depends on the scale parameter,\n${\\mathcal{L}}_{a}$ - one can identify a generalized Hamiltonian density from\nwhich first-order dynamical equations can be obtained.

Once the generalized\nHamiltonian density is properly defined, the constraints on the\ngravity-matter-field system are straightforwardly obtained through the\nfirst-order Hamilton equations. The procedure is illustrated for three examples\nof cosmological interest for studies of the dark sector: real scalar fields,\ntachyonic fields and generalized Born-Infeld tachyonic fields. The inclusion of\nsome isentropic fluid component into the Friedmann equation allows for\nidentifying an exact correspondence between the dark sector underlying scalar\nfield and an ordinary real scalar field dynamics.

A process for their backward evolution is referred to as a time reversed\nprocess. It is often greatly helpful to view a stochastic model from two\ndifferent time directions. In particular, if some property is unchanged under\ntime reversal, we may better understand that property. A concept of\nreversibility is invented for this invariance. Local balance for a stationary\nMarkov chain has been used for a weaker version of the reversibility. However,\nit is still too strong for queueing applications.\n  We are concerned with a continuous time Markov chain, but dose not assume it\nhas the stationary distribution. We define reversibility in structure as an\ninvariant property of a family of the set of models under certain operation.\nThe member of this set is a pair of transition rate function and its supporting\nmeasure, and each set represents dynamics of queueing systems such as arrivals\nand departures. We use a permutation {\\Gamma} of the family menmbers, that is,\nthe sets themselves, to describe the change of the dynamics under time\nreversal. This reversibility is is called {\\Gamma}-reversibility in structure.\n  To apply these definitions, we introduce new classes of models, called\nreacting systems and self-reacting systems. Using those definitions and models,\nwe give a unified view for queues and their networks which have reversibility\nin structure, and show how their stationary distributions can be obtained. They\ninclude symmetric service, batch movements and state dependent routing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 14:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 01:37:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2013 01:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

This is the case in particular for fixed\npoint combinators, as they all have the same BT. Another interesting equation,\nwhose consideration was suggested by Scott, is BY = BYS, an equation valid in\nthe classical model P-omega of lambda-calculus, and hence valid with respect to\nBT-equality but nevertheless the terms are beta-inconvertible. To prove such\nbeta-inconvertibilities, we employ `clocked' BT's, with annotations that convey\ninformation of the tempo in which the data in the BT are produced. Boehm Trees\nare thus enriched with an intrinsic clock behaviour, leading to a refined\ndiscrimination method for lambda-terms. The corresponding equality is strictly\nintermediate between beta-convertibility and Boehm Tree equality, the equality\nin the model P-omega. An analogous approach pertains to Levy-Longo and\nBerarducci Trees. Our refined Boehm Trees find in particular an application in\nbeta-discriminating fixed point combinators (fpc's). It turns out that Scott's\nequation BY = BYS is the key to unlocking a plethora of fpc's, generated by a\nvariety of production schemes of which the simplest was found by Boehm, stating\nthat new fpc's are obtained by postfixing the term SI, also known as Smullyan's\nOwl. We prove that all these newly generated fpc's are indeed new, by\nconsidering their clocked BT's. Even so, not all pairs of new fpc's can be\ndiscriminated this way. For that purpose we increase the discrimination power\nby a precision of the clock notion that we call `atomic clock'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 14:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 08:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The\nprimary goal of the paper to develop a general framework for constructing high\norder local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods for approximating viscosity\nsolutions of these fully nonlinear PDEs which are merely continuous functions\nby definition. In order to capture discontinuities of the first order\nderivative $u_x$ of the solution $u$, two independent functions $q_1$ and $q_2$\nare introduced to approximate one-sided derivatives of $u$. Similarly, to\ncapture the discontinuities of the second order derivative $u_{xx}$, four\nindependent functions $p_{1}$, $p_{2}$, $p_{3}$, and $p_{4}$ are used to\napproximate one-sided derivatives of $q_1$ and $q_2$. The proposed LDG\nframework, which is based on a nonstandard mixed formulation of the underlying\nPDE, embeds a given fully nonlinear problem into a mostly linear system of\nequations where the given nonlinear differential operator must be replaced by a\nnumerical operator which allows multiple value inputs of the first and second\norder derivatives $u_x$ and $u_{xx}$. An easy to verify criterion for\nconstructing \"good\" numerical operators is also proposed. It consists of a\nconsistency and a generalized monotonicity. To ensure such a generalized\nmonotonicity, the crux of the construction is to introduce the numerical moment\nin the numerical operator. The proposed framework extends a companion finite\ndifference framework developed by the authors in [9] and allows for the\napproximation of fully nonlinear PDEs using high order polynomials and\nnon-uniform meshes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2012 23:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-05"}
