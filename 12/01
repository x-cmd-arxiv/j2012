In the case of incomplete lineage sorting,\nthis phenomenon has recently been well-studied, and some elegant solutions for\nspecies tree reconstruction have been proposed. One particularly simple and\nstatistically consistent estimator of the species tree under incomplete lineage\nsorting is to combine three-taxon analyses, which are phylogenetically robust\nto incomplete lineage sorting. In this paper, we consider whether such an\napproach will also work under lateral gene transfer (LGT). By providing an\nexact analysis of some cases of this model, we show that there is a zone of\ninconsistency for triplet-based species tree reconstruction under LGT. However,\na triplet-based approach will consistently reconstruct a species tree under\nmodels of LGT, provided that the expected number of LGT transfers is not too\nhigh. Our analysis involves a novel connection between the LGT problem and\nrandom walks on cyclic graphs.

This litter-to-litter variation, or \"litter\neffects\", can influence the results in addition to the experimental factors of\ninterest. Furthermore, an experimental treatment can be applied to whole\nlitters rather than to individual offspring. For example, in the valproic acid\n(VPA) model of autism, VPA is administered to pregnant females thereby inducing\nthe disease phenotype in the offspring.

Binding specificity has a strong impact on the evolution of\ngene expression, because it determines how easily regulatory interactions are\ngained and lost. Nevertheless, we have a relatively poor understanding of what\nevolutionary forces determine the specificity of binding sites. Here we address\nthis question by studying regulatory modules composed of multiple binding\nsites. Using a population-genetic model, we show that more complex regulatory\nmodules, composed of a greater number of binding sites, must employ binding\nsites that are individually less specific, compared to less complex regulatory\nmodules. This effect is extremely general, and it hold regardless of the\nregulatory logic of a module. We attribute this phenomenon to the inability of\nstabilising selection to maintain highly specific sites in large regulatory\nmodules. Our analysis helps to explain broad empirical trends in the yeast\nregulatory network: those genes with a greater number of transcriptional\nregulators feature by less specific binding sites, and there is less variance\nin their specificity, compared to genes with fewer regulators. Likewise, our\nresults also help to explain the well-known trend towards lower specificity in\nthe transcription factor binding sites of higher eukaryotes, which perform\ncomplex regulatory tasks, compared to prokaryotes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 18:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-30"}

The numerical study of level\nand eigenstate statistics, and of the singular properties of the probability\ndistribution of the local density of states all support the existence of this\nnew intermediate phase. Our results suggest that the localization transition\nmay change nature in high dimensional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 18:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 08:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

We consider debates of partial and zero\ninformation, where the prover is prevented from seeing some or all of the\nmessages of the refuter, as well as those of complete information. The classes\nof languages with debates checkable by verifiers operating under severe bounds\non the memory and randomness are studied.\n  We give full characterizations of versions of these classes corresponding to\nsimultaneous bounds of O(1) space and O(1) random bits, and of logarithmic\nspace and polynomial time.

This topological Chern map provides a natural candidate for the\nexistence of a rational structure on the periodic cylic homology of a smooth\nproper dg-algebra, within the theory of noncommutative Hodge structures. The\ndefinition of topological K-theory consists in two steps : taking the\ntopological realization of algebraic K-theory, and inverting the Bott element.\nThe topological realization is the left Kan extension of the functor \"space of\ncomplex points\" to all simplicial presheaves over complex algebraic varieties.\nOur first main result states that the topological K-theory of the unit\ndg-category is the spectrum BU. For this we are led to prove a homotopical\ngeneralization of Deligne's cohomological proper descent, using Lurie's proper\ndescent.

At equilibrium, the monomer\ndensity profile \\phi(z) of the LPB is found to decline as \\phi(z) ~ z^{-\\alpha}\nwith the distance from the grafting plane z, while the distribution of chain\nlengths in the brush scales as c(N) ~ N^{-\\tau}.

We lay out a statistically rigorous way to\nconstrain the Galactic potential parameters by constructing the joint\nlikelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing over\nthe DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection\nfunction inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the\nuncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. On that basis,\nwe study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential that can be\nreached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions.

In contrast to some previous works, we find that 3D simulations\nexplode later than 2D simulations, and that L_crit at fixed mass accretion rate\nis somewhat higher in 3D than in 2D. We find, however, that in 2D L_crit\nincreases as the numerical resolution of the simulation increases. In contrast\nto some previous works, we argue that the average entropy of the gain region is\nin fact not a good indicator of explosion but is rather a reflection of the\ngreater mass in the gain region in 2D. We compare our simulations to\nsemi-analytic explosion criteria and examine the nature of the convective\nmotions in 2D and 3D. We discuss the balance between neutrino-driven-buoyancy\nand drag forces. In particular, we show that the drag force will be\nproportional to a buoyant plume's surface area while the buoyant force is\nproportional to a plume's volume and, therefore, plumes with greater\nvolume-to-surface area ratios will rise more quickly. We show that buoyant\nplumes in 2D are inherently larger, with greater volume-to-surface area ratios,\nthan plumes in 3D. In the scenario that the supernova shock expansion is\ndominated by neutrino-driven buoyancy, this balance between buoyancy and drag\nforces may explain why 3D simulations explode later than 2D simulations and why\nL_crit increases with resolution.

But bundling masks the fact that\ndifferent users require different combinations of resources (e.g., CPUs,\nmemory, bandwidth) to process their jobs. The presence of multiple resources in\nfact allows an operator to offer many different types of pricing strategies,\nwhich may have different effects on its revenue. Moreover, to avoid user\ndissatisfaction, operators must consider the impact of their chosen prices on\nthe fairness of the jobs processed for different users. In this paper, we\ndevelop an analytical framework that accounts for the fairness and revenue\ntradeoffs that arise in a datacenter's multi-resource setting and the impact\nthat different pricing plans can have on this tradeoff. We characterize the\nimplications of different pricing plans on various fairness metrics and derive\nanalytical limits on the operator's fairness-revenue tradeoff. We then provide\nan algorithm to navigate this tradeoff and compare the tradeoff points for\ndifferent pricing strategies on a data trace taken from a Google cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 21:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 17:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}

The algorithm runs in\nO(n^2/eps^2) time, and approximates Per(A) to within eps*||A||^n additive\nerror. A major advantage of Gurvits's algorithm is that it works for arbitrary\nmatrices, not just for nonnegative matrices. This makes it highly relevant to\nquantum optics, where the permanents of bounded-norm complex matrices play a\ncentral role. Indeed, the existence of Gurvits's algorithm is why, in their\nrecent work on the hardness of quantum optics, Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA) had\nto talk about sampling problems rather than estimation problems.\n  In this paper, we improve Gurvits's algorithm in two ways. First, using an\nidea from quantum optics, we generalize the algorithm so that it yields a\nbetter approximation when the matrix A has either repeated rows or repeated\ncolumns. Translating back to quantum optics, this lets us classically estimate\nthe probability of any outcome of an AA-type experiment---even an outcome\ninvolving multiple photons \"bunched\" in the same mode---at least as well as\nthat probability can be estimated by the experiment itself. (This does not, of\ncourse, let us solve the AA sampling problem.) It also yields a general upper\nbound on the probabilities of \"bunched\" outcomes, which resolves a conjecture\nof Gurvits and might be of independent physical interest.\n  Second, we use eps-biased sets to derandomize Gurvits's algorithm, in the\nspecial case where the matrix A is nonnegative. More interestingly, we\ngeneralize the notion of eps-biased sets to the complex numbers, construct\n\"complex eps-biased sets,\" then use those sets to derandomize even our\ngeneralization of Gurvits's algorithm to the multirow/multicolumn case (again\nfor nonnegative A). Whether Gurvits's algorithm can be derandomized for general\nA remains an outstanding problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 22:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 23:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-06"}

Despite receiving considerable attention, the\nprecise relationship between network connectivity and encoded patterns is still\npoorly understood. Here we consider this problem for networks of\nthreshold-linear neurons whose computational function is to learn and store a\nset of binary patterns (e.g., a neural code) as \"permitted sets\" of the\nnetwork. We introduce a simple Encoding Rule that selectively turns \"on\"\nsynapses between neurons that co-appear in one or more patterns. The rule uses\nsynapses that are binary, in the sense of having only two states (\"on\" or\n\"off\"), but also heterogeneous, with weights drawn from an underlying synaptic\nstrength matrix S. Our main results precisely describe the stored patterns that\nresult from the Encoding Rule -- including unintended \"spurious\" states -- and\ngive an explicit characterization of the dependence on S. In particular, we\nfind that binary patterns are successfully stored in these networks when the\nexcitatory connections between neurons are geometrically balanced -- i.e., they\nsatisfy a set of geometric constraints. Furthermore, we find that certain types\nof neural codes are \"natural\" in the context of these networks, meaning that\nthe full code can be accurately learned from a highly undersampled set of\npatterns. Interestingly, many commonly observed neural codes in cortical and\nhippocampal areas are natural in this sense. As an application, we construct\nnetworks that encode hippocampal place field codes nearly exactly, following\npresentation of only a small fraction of patterns. To obtain our results, we\nprove new theorems using classical ideas from convex and distance geometry,\nsuch as Cayley-Menger determinants, revealing a novel connection between these\nareas of mathematics and coding properties of neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 22:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2013 22:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 20:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

While work is being done to implement different types of biometrics\ninto mobile phones, such as photo based biometrics, voice is a more natural\nchoice. The idea of voice as a biometric identifier has been around a long\ntime. One of the major concerns with using voice as an identifier is the\ninstability of voice. We have developed a protocol that addresses those\ninstabilities and preserves privacy. This paper describes a novel protocol that\nallows a user to authenticate using voice on a mobile/remote device without\ncompromising their privacy. We first discuss the \\vv protocol, which has\nrecently been introduced in research literature, and then describe its\nlimitations.

Here, we propose a simple functional scaling model in which these two\nopposing results are reconciled. Basic principles related to crown shape,\nenergy optimization and the finite size scaling approach were used to define a\nset of relationships based on a single parameter, which allows us to predict\nthe slope of the tree-size distributions in a steady state condition. We tested\nthe model predictions on four temperate mountain forests.

In this paper, we generalize Holmboe's\nmechanistic picture of linear shear instabilities by (i) not initially\nspecifying the type of the waves, and (ii) by providing the option for\nnon-normal growth. We demonstrate the mechanism behind linear shear\ninstabilities by proposing a purely kinematic model consisting of two linear,\nDoppler-shifted, progressive interfacial waves moving in opposite directions.\nMoreover, we have found a necessary and sufficient (N&S) condition for the\nexistence of exponentially growing instabilities in idealized shear flows. The\ntwo interfacial waves, starting from arbitrary initial conditions, eventually\nphase-lock and resonate (grow exponentially), provided the N&S condition is\nsatisfied.

The standard\nquantum process tomography (SQPT) has the unique property that it can be\napplied without introducing any additional quantum resources. In present work,\nwe shall focus on the following two topics about the SQPT. At first, in the\nSQPT protocol for a $d$-dimensional system, one should encounter a problem in\nsolving of a set of $d^4$ linear equations in order to get the matrix\ncontaining the complete information about the unknown quantum channel. Until\nnow, the general form of the solution is unknown. And a long existed conviction\nis that the solutions are not unique. Here, we shall develop a self-consistent\nscheme, in which bounded linear operators are presented by vectors, to\nconstruct the set of linear equations. With the famous Cramer's rule for the\nset of linear equations, we are able to give the general form of the solution\nand prove that it is unique. In second, the central idea of the SQPT is to\nprepare a set of linearly independent inputs and measuring the outputs via the\nquantum state tomography (QST). Letting the inputs and the measurements be\nprepared by two sets of the rank-one positive-operator-valued measures [POVMs],\nwhere each POVM is supposed to be linearly independent and informationally\ncomplete (IC), we observe that SQPT now is equivalent to deciding a unknown\nstate with a set of product IC-POVM in the $d^2$-dimensional Hilbert space.\nFollowing the general linear state tomography theory, we show that the product\nsymmetric IC-POVM should minimize the mean-square Hilbert-Schmidt distance\nbetween the estimator and the true states. So, an optimal SQPT can be realized\nby preparing both the inputs and the measurements as the symmetric IC-POVM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 12:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

But matter in itself is\nconsidered a very complex notion in modern physics. More specifically, at a\nmicroscopic level, matter and energy are no longer retained within their simple\nform, and quantum mechanical models are proposed wherein potential form is\nconsidered in addition to actual form. In this paper we propose an alternative\nto standard Neodarwinian evolution theory. We suggest that the starting point\nof evolution theory cannot be limited to actual variation whereupon is\nselected, but to variation in the potential of entities according to the\ncontext. We therefore develop a formalism, referred to as Context driven\nActualization of Potential (CAP), which handles potentiality and describes the\nevolution of entities as an actualization of potential through a reiterated\ninteraction with the context. As in quantum mechanics, lack of knowledge of the\nentity, its context, or the interaction between context and entity leads to\ndifferent forms of indeterminism in relation to the state of the entity. This\nindeterminism generates a non-Kolmogorovian distribution of probabilities that\nis different from the classical distribution of chance described by Darwinian\nevolution theory, which stems from a 'actuality focused', i.e. materialistic,\nview of nature. We also present a quantum evolution game that highlights the\nmain differences arising from our new perspective and shows that it is more\nfundamental to consider evolution in general, and biological evolution in\nspecific, as a process of actualization of potential induced by context, for\nwhich its material reduction is only a special case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 13:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

Accounting for different\nestimates of positive selection has been difficult, in part because selection\non polymorphism within a species is known to obscure a signal of positive\nselection between species. While methods have been developed to control for the\nconfounding effects of negative selection against deleterious polymorphism, the\nimpact of balancing selection on estimates of positive selection has not been\nassessed. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there is no signal of positive selection\nwithin protein coding sequences as the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous\npolymorphism is higher than that of divergence. To investigate the impact of\nbalancing selection on estimates of positive selection we examined five genes\nwith high rates of nonsynonymous polymorphism in S. cerevisiae relative to\ndivergence from S. paradoxus. One of the genes, a high affinity zinc\ntransporter ZRT1, shows an elevated rate of synonymous polymorphism indicative\nof balancing selection. The high rate of synonymous polymorphism coincides with\nnonsynonymous divergence between three haplotype groups, which we find to be\nfunctionally indistinguishable. We conclude that balancing selection is not\nlikely to be a common cause of genes harboring a large excess of nonsynonymous\npolymorphism in yeast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 14:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

As such, modelling\nopinion dynamics represents an important research area that has been\nprogressively acquiring relevance in many different domains. Existing\napproaches have mostly represented opinions through discrete binary or\ncontinuous variables by exploring a whole panoply of cases: e.g. independence,\nnoise, external effects, multiple issues. In most of these cases the crucial\ningredient is an attractive dynamics through which similar or similar enough\nagents get closer. Only rarely the possibility of explicit disagreement has\nbeen taken into account (i.e., the possibility for a repulsive interaction\namong individuals' opinions), and mostly for discrete or 1-dimensional\nopinions, through the introduction of additional model parameters. Here we\nintroduce a new model of opinion formation, which focuses on the interplay\nbetween the possibility of explicit disagreement, modulated in a\nself-consistent way by the existing opinions' overlaps between the interacting\nindividuals, and the effect of external information on the system. Opinions are\nmodelled as a vector of continuous variables related to multiple possible\nchoices for an issue. Information can be modulated to account for promoting\nmultiple possible choices. Numerical results show that extreme information\nresults in segregation and has a limited effect on the population, while milder\nmessages have better success and a cohesion effect. Additionally, the initial\ncondition plays an important role, with the population forming one or multiple\nclusters based on the initial average similarity between individuals, with a\ntransition point depending on the number of opinion choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 15:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-06"}

The swimmers are assumed to be spherical, to\nself-propel using tangential surface deformation, and the computations are\nimplemented using a finite element method. The emphasis of the study is on the\nchange of the swimming kinematics, energetics, and flow disturbance from\nNewtonian to viscoelastic, and on the distinction between pusher and puller\nswimmers. In all cases, the viscoelastic swimming speed is below the Newtonian\none, with a minimum obtained for intermediate values of the Weissenberg number,\n$We$. An analysis of the flow field places the origin of this swimming\ndegradation in non-Newtonian elongational stresses. The power required for\nswimming is also systematically below the Newtonian power, and always a\ndecreasing function of $We$. A detail energetic balance of the swimming problem\npoints at the polymeric part of the stress as the primary $We$-decreasing\nenergetic contribution, while the contributions of the work done by the swimmer\nfrom the solvent remain essentially $We$-independent. In addition, we observe\nnegative values of the polymeric power density in some flow regions, indicating\npositive elastic work by the polymers on the fluid. The hydrodynamic\nefficiency, defined as the ratio of the useful to total rate of work, is always\nabove the Newtonian case, with a maximum relative value obtained at\nintermediate Weissenberg numbers. Finally, the presence of polymeric stresses\nleads to an increase of the rate of decay of the flow velocity in the fluid,\nand a decrease of the magnitude of the stresslet governing the magnitude of the\neffective bulk stress in the fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 15:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The answer on whether this situation takes place or not, can be\nresolved by dealing with the running of the ratios between Yukawa and scalar\ncouplings to the gauge coupling. The behavior of these ratios does not depend\ntoo much on whether gauge coupling is asymptotically free (AF) or not. It can\nbe shown that the UV stable fixed point for the Yukawa coupling is not\nsupersymmetric. Taking this into account, one can break down SUSY only in the\nscalar coupling sector.
