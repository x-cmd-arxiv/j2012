The modified BFGS\nmatrix estimates a modified Hessian matrix which is a convex combination of an\nidentity matrix for the steepest descent algorithm and a Hessian matrix for the\nNewton algorithm. The coefficient of the convex combination in the modified\nBFGS algorithm is dynamically chosen in every iteration. It is proved that, for\nany twice differentiable nonlinear function (convex or non-convex), the\nalgorithm is globally convergent to a stationary point. If the stationary point\nis a local optimizer where the Hessian is strongly positive definite in a\nneighborhood of the optimizer, the iterates will eventually enter and stay in\nthe neighborhood, and the modified BFGS algorithm reduces to the BFGS algorithm\nin this neighborhood. Therefore, the modified BFGS algorithm is super-linearly\nconvergent. Moreover, the computational cost of the modified BFGS in each\niteration is almost the same as the cost of the BFGS. Numerical test on the\nCUTE test set is reported. The performance of the modified BFGS algorithm\nimplemented in our MATLAB function is compared to the BFGS algorithm\nimplemented in the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox function, a limited memory BFGS\nimplemented as L-BFGS, a descent conjugate gradient algorithm implemented as\nCG-Descent 5.3, and a limited memory, descent and conjugate algorithm\nimplemented as L-CG-Descent.

We derive limits on\nthe parameter space of several Little Higgs models (simple group and product\ngroup models, with and without T-parity), both from the experimental data from\nATLAS and CMS about the different Higgs discovery channel and the electroweak\nprecision observables. We perform a fit of several Little Higgs models to all\nelectroweak parameters from measurements of SLC, LEP, Tevatron, and LHC.

The diagonal branch is a\nhigh-intensity state that emerges when the X-ray luminosity exceeds a critical\nlimit.

One property\nof this behavior is that, independent of initial conditions, the minimum radius\nexhibits power law scaling with the time left to breakup tau. Because they have\nadditional structure and shear dependent viscosity, liquid crystals pose an\ninteresting complication to such studies. Here, we investigate the breakup of a\nsynthetic nematic liquid crystal known as MBBA. We determine the phase of the\nsolution by using a cross polarizer setup in situ with the liquid bridge\nbreakup apparatus. Consistent with previous studies of scaling behavior in\nviscous-inertial fluid breakup, when MBBA is in the isotropic phase, the\nminimum radius decreases as tau^{1.03 \\pm 0.04}. In the nematic phase however,\nwe observe very different thinning behavior. Our measurements of the thinning\nprofile are consistent with two interpretations. In the first interpretation,\nthe breakup is universal and consists of two different regimes. The first\nregime is characterized by a symmetric profile with a single minimum whose\nradius decreases as tau^{1.51 \\pm 0.06}. The second and final regime is\ncharacterized by two minima whose radii decrease as tau^{0.52 \\pm 0.11}. These\nresults are in excellent agreement with previous measurements of breakup in the\nnematic phase of liquid crystal 8CB and 5CB. Interestingly, we find that the\nentire thinning behavior can also be fit with an exponential decay such that\nR_{min} \\sim exp((1.2\\times 10^2 Hz) tau). This dependence is more reminiscent\nof breakup in polymers where entropic stretching slows the thinning process. An\nanalogous mechanism for slowing in liquid crystals could arise from the role\nplayed by topological constraints governing defect dynamics. Consistent with\nthis interpretation, crossed polarizer images indicate that significant\nalignment of the liquid crystal domains occurs during breakup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2012 23:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

To explain the growth of the\nmagnetic field strength over many orders of magnitude fast amplification\nprocesses need to operate. The most efficient mechanism known today is the\nsmall-scale dynamo, which converts turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic\nenergy leading to an exponential growth of the magnetic field. The efficiency\nof the dynamo depends on the type of turbulence indicated by the slope of the\nturbulence spectrum v(l) \\propto l^{theta}, where v(l) is the eddy velocity at\na scale l. We explore turbulent spectra ranging from incompressible Kolmogorov\nturbulence with theta = 1/3 to highly compressible Burgers turbulence with\ntheta = 1/2. In this work we analyze the properties of the small-scale dynamo\nfor low magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm, which denotes the ratio of the magnetic\nReynolds number, Rm, to the hydrodynamical one, Re. We solve the Kazantsev\nequation, which describes the evolution of the small-scale magnetic field,\nusing the WKB approximation. In the limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers the\ngrowth rate is proportional to Rm^{(1-theta)/(1+theta)}. We furthermore discuss\nthe critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm_crit, which is required for\nsmall-scale dynamo action. The value of Rm_crit is roughly 100 for Kolmogorov\nturbulence and 2700 for Burgers. Furthermore, we discuss that Rm_crit provides\na stronger constraint in the limit of low Pm than it does for large Pm. We\nconclude that the small-scale dynamo can operate in the regime of low magnetic\nPrandtl numbers, if the magnetic Reynolds number is large enough. Thus, the\nmagnetic field amplification on small scales can take place in a broad range of\nphysical environments and amplify week magnetic seed fields on short\ntimescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2012 00:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The notable phenomenological feature of the\nwino LSP is the degeneracy with its charged SU(2)_L partner (the charged wino)\nin mass. The tiny mass splitting makes the charged wino long-lived, which\nallows us to detect the wino production at the LHC experiment by searching for\nthe disappearing charged tracks inside the detectors. Since the reach of the\nexperiment is sensitive to the mass splitting, it is mandatory to estimate it\nvery precisely.

By using both\nthe axes and the center, components for an observation that belong to various\nstudies can be separately estimated. Both of the components for variables and\nobservations are scaled to a unit length, which enables relationships to be\nseen between them.\n  Results: Analyses in transcriptome studies showed an improvement in the\nseparation of experimental groups and in robustness to bias and noise.

This creates a phenomenon called volatility clustering, where\nlarge price movements on one day are followed by similarly large movements on\nsuccessive days, creating temporal clusters. The GARCH model, which treats\nvolatility as a drift process, is commonly used to capture this behavior.\nHowever research suggests that volatility is often better described by a\nstructural break model, where the volatility undergoes abrupt jumps in addition\nto drift. Most efforts to integrate these jumps into the GARCH methodology have\nresulted in models which are either very computationally demanding, or which\nmake problematic assumptions about the distribution of the instruments, often\nassuming that they are Gaussian. We present a new approach which uses ideas\nfrom nonparametric statistics to identify structural break points without\nmaking such distributional assumptions, and then models drift separately within\neach identified regime. Using our method, we investigate the volatility of\nseveral major stock indexes, and find that our approach can potentially give an\nimproved fit compared to more commonly used techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2012 10:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-08"}

Significant part of this\nenergy cost goes to system update by downloading regularly patches and bug\nfixes to solve security problems and to assure that the operating system and\nother systems function properly. This paper describes a new design of Windows\nServer Update Services (WSUS), system responsible of downloads of the mentioned\npatches and updates from Microsoft Update website and then distributes them to\ncomputers on a network. The general idea behind our proposed design is simple.\nInstead of the periodical check done by the WSUS servers to ensure update form\nMicrosoft main servers, we rather propose to reverse the scenario in order to\nreduce energy consumption. In the proposed design, the Microsoft main server(s)\nsends signal to all WSUS servers to inform them about new updates. Once the\nsignal received, WSUS can contact the main server to start downloading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Dec 2012 13:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

The derived lithium abundances log \\epsilon(Li) may be\nconsidered in three groups, namely: (i) 10 Li-rich giants with log \\epsilon(Li)\n= 2.0-3.2 (all 10 are F-type or A9 stars); (ii) 13 G- to K0-type stars with Li\nabundances in the narrow range log \\epsilon(Li) = 1.1-1.8; (iii) all other\nstars provide just upper limits to the Li abundance.\n  The derived Li abundances are compared with theoretical predictions of 2-15\nMsun stars.
