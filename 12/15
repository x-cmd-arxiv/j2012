Our method is based on\nsplitting the displacement field into a long and a short-range component. The\nlong-range component is computed by second order LPT (2LPT). This approximation\ncontains a tidal nonlocal and nonlinear term. Unfortunately, 2LPT fails on\nsmall scales due to severe shell crossing and a crude quadratic behaviour in\nthe low density regime. The spherical collapse (SC) approximation has been\nrecently reported to correct for both effects by adding an ideal collapse\ntruncation. However, this approach fails to reproduce the structures on large\nscales where it is significantly less correlated with the N-body result than\n2LPT or linear LPT (the Zeldovich approximation). We propose to combine both\napproximations using for the short-range displacement field the SC solution. A\nGaussian filter with a smoothing radius r_S is used to separate between both\nregimes. We use the result of 25 dark matter only N-body simulations to\nbenchmark at z=0 the different approximations: 1st, 2nd, 3rd order LPT, SC and\nour novel combined ALPT model. This comparison demonstrates that our method\nimproves previous approximations at all scales showing ~25% and ~75% higher\ncorrelation than 2LPT with the N-body solution at k = 1 and 2 h Mpc^-1,\nrespectively. We conduct a parameter study to determine the optimal range of\nsmoothing radii and find that the maximum correlation is achieved with r_S = 4\n- 5 h^-1 Mpc.

It relies on a sparse QR factorization\ncoupled with iterative weighted least squares methods. In essence, our scheme\nconsists of a direct component, comprised of matrix compression and\nfactorization, followed by an iterative component to enforce certain equality\nconstraints.

The\nphenomenology is quite interesting, since the expected polarization depends\nboth on the mixing in the stop and neutralino sectors and on the mass\ndifferences between the stop and the neutralino. We find that a mixed stop\nbehaves almost like a right-handed stop due to the larger hypercharge that\nenters the stop/top/gaugino coupling and that these polarisation effects\ndisappear, when $m_{\\tilde t_1} \\approx m_t+m_{\\tilde\\chi^0_i}$. After a\ndiscussion on the expected top polarization from the decay of a scalar top\nquark, we focus on the interplay of polarization and kinematics at the LHC. We\ndiscuss different probes of the top polarization in terms of lab-frame\nobservables. We find that these observables faithfully reflect the polarization\nof the parent top-quark, but also have a non-trivial dependence on the\nkinematics of the stop production and decay process. In addition, we illustrate\nthe effect of top polarization on the energy and transverse momentum of the\ndecay lepton in the laboratory frame. Our results show that both spectra are\nsoftened substantially in case of a negatively polarized top, particularly for\na large mass difference between the stop and the neutralino. Thus, the search\nstrategies, and the conclusions that can be drawn from them, depends not just\non the mass difference $m_{\\tilde t} - m_{\\tilde\\chi_{i}^{0}}$ due to the usual\nkinematic effects but also on the effects of top polarization on the decay\nkinematics the extent of which depends in turn on the said mass difference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 16:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Here, we\nsummarize some recent results which give support to such a possibility.

The\noccultation at 1.19 micron is only marginally constrained at dF_1190 = 1711\n(+/-745) ppm.\n  Conclusions: We have shown that the detection of occultations in the visible\nis within reach even for 1m class telescopes if a considerable number of\nindividual events are observed. Our results suggest an oxygen-dominated\natmosphere of WASP-19b, making the planet an interesting test case for\noxygen-rich planets without temperature inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 18:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 08:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-28"}

We find that the\ntypical halo mass ($M_1$) as well as the satellite power law index ($\\alpha$)\nincrease with stellar mass. This indicates, (1) that galaxies with higher\nstellar mass sit in more massive dark matter halos and (2) that these more\nmassive dark matter halos accumulate satellites faster with growing mass\ncompared to halos occupied by low stellar mass galaxies.

Each system contains spatially separated components\nwith both signs of chirality, the upper portion having negative (positive)\nchirality and the lower part possessing positive (negative) chirality. The\ncomponents within a system are a filament channel (represented partially by\nsets of chromospheric fibrils), a filament (if present), a filament cavity,\nsometimes a sigmoid, and always an overlying arcade of coronal loops. When we\nview these components as parts of large-scale chiral systems, we more clearly\nsee that it is not the individual components of chiral systems that erupt but\nrather it is the approximate upper parts of an entire evolving chiral system\nthat erupts. We illustrate the typical pattern of build-up to eruptive solar\nevents first without and then including the chirality in each stage of the\nbuild-up.

Our theory allows the evaluation of\nthe related time-dependent parameters as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2012 10:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-11"}

For an isotropic Universe, we expect\nonly a small asymmetry due to noise and the presence of nearby structures. This\ntest does not depend on the assumed content of the Universe, the assumed model\nof gravity, or the spatial curvature of the Universe. The expectation for\npossible fluctuations due to large scale structure is evaluated for the \\Lambda\ncold dark matter (\\Lambda CDM) model and is compared to the supernova data from\nthe Constitution set for four different light curve fitters, thus allowing a\nstudy of the systematic effects.\n  The expected order of magnitude of the hemispherical asymmetry of the Hubble\nexpansion agrees with the observed one. The direction of the Hubble asymmetry\nis established at 95% confidence level (C.L.) using both, the MLCS2k2 and the\nSALT II light curve fitter. The highest expansion rate is found towards (l, b)\n~ (-35{\\deg},-19{\\deg}), which agrees with directions reported by other\nstudies. Its amplitude is not in contradiction to expectations from the \\Lambda\nCDM model. The measured Hubble anisotropy is \\Delta H/H ~ 0.026.

In this\nmodel, the smallness of the neutrino mass is explained by the tiny lepton\nnumber violating coupling between one of the singlets with the standard\nleft-handed neutrinos. This allows one to have the right handed neutrino mass\nat the TeV scale as well as appreciable mixing between the light and heavy\nstates. This model is fully reconstructible in terms of the neutrino\noscillation parameters apart from the overall coupling strengths. We show that\nthe overall coupling strength $y_\\nu$ for the Dirac type coupling between the\nleft handed neutrino and one of the singlets can be restricted by consideration\nof the (meta)stability bounds on the electroweak vacuum. In this scenario the\nlepton flavor violating decays of charged leptons can be appreciable which can\nput further constraint on $y_\\nu$, for right-handed neutrinos at TeV scale. We\ndiscuss the combined constraints on $y_\\nu$ for this scenario from the process\n$\\mu \\rightarrow e \\gamma$ and from the consideration of vacuum (meta)stability\nconstraints on the Higgs self coupling.
