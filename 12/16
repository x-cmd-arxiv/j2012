Two\nparticles species are defined, one species of particles have rest frames with\nrest mass, and another species of particles do not have rest frame and can not\ndefine rest mass. We prove that for the particles which have rest frames, the\nGalilean transformation is the only linear transformation of space-time that\nallows infinite speed of particle motion. Hence without any assumption, an\nupper bound of speed is required for all non-Galilean linear transformations.\nWe then present a novel derivation of the mass-velocity and the mass-energy\nrelations in the framework of relativistic dynamics, which is solely based on\nthe principle of relativity and basic definitions of relativistic momentum and\nenergy. The generalized Lorentz transformation is then determined. The new\nrelativistic formulas are not related directly to the speed of light $c$, but\nare replaced by a Relativity Constant $C_R$ which is an universal speed\nconstant of the Nature introduced in relativistic dynamics. Particles having\nrest mass are called tardyons moving slower than $C_R$. Particles having\nneither rest frames nor rest mass are called $tachyons$ moving faster than\n$C_R$, and with the real mass-velocity relation $m=|\\vec{p}_\\infty\n|(v^2-C_R^2)^{-1/2}$ where $\\vec{p}_\\infty $ is the finite momentum of tachyon\nat infinite speed.

Following the systematics of the WR star\ncatalogues, these stars obtain the names WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc. In this\npaper, we present and analyse new near-IR, $J$, $H$, and $K$-band, spectra\nusing the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. For that purpose,\nthe atomic data base of the code has been extended in order to include all\nsignificant lines in the near-IR bands.\n  The spectra of both stars are classified as WN9h. As their spectra are very\nsimilar the parameters that we obtained by the spectral analyses hardly differ.\nDespite their late spectral subtype, we found relatively high stellar\ntemperatures of 63 kK. The wind composition is dominated by helium, while\nhydrogen is depleted to 25 per cent by mass.\n  Because of their location in the Scutum-Centaurus arm, WR\\,120bb and\nWR\\,120bc appear highly reddened, $A_{K_{\\rm s}} \\approx 2$ mag. We adopt a\ncommon distance of 5.8\\,kpc to both stars, which complies with the typical\nabsolute $K$-band magnitude for the WN9h subtype of -6.5 mag, is consistent\nwith their observed extinction based on comparison with other massive stars in\nthe region, and allows for the possibility that their shells are interacting\nwith each other. This leads to luminosities of $\\log(L/L_\\odot) = 5.66$ and\n5.54 for WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc, with large uncertainties due to the adopted\ndistance.\n  The values of the luminosities of WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc imply that the\nimmediate precursors of both stars were red supergiants (RSG). This implies in\nturn that the circumstellar shells associated with WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc were\nformed by interaction between the WR wind and the dense material shed during\nthe preceding RSG phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Dec 2012 21:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

These features should be detectable in the inelastic electron\ntunneling spectroscopy, $d^2I/dV^2$, using local probing techniques. Inelastic\nFriedel oscillations distort the spectral density at energies close to the\ninelastic mode. In the strong coupling limit, a local negative $U$-center forms\nin the atoms surrounding the impurity site.

We\nfurther consider the effects of the negative $U$ formation and its evolution\nfrom weak to strong coupling. The negative $U$-site effectively acts as local\nimpurity such that sharp resonances appear in the local electronic structure.\nThe main resonances are caused by elastic scattering off the impurity site, and\nthe features are dressed by the presence of vibrationally activated side\nresonances.

We show that, surprisingly, if we use\nmulti-objective optimization with these norms, then we can do no better,\norder-wise, than an algorithm that exploits only one of the present structures.\nThis result suggests that to fully exploit the multiple structures, we need an\nentirely new convex relaxation, i.e. not one that is a function of the convex\nrelaxations used for each structure. We then specialize our results to the case\nof sparse and low-rank matrices. We show that a nonconvex formulation of the\nproblem can recover the model from very few measurements, which is on the order\nof the degrees of freedom of the matrix, whereas the convex problem obtained\nfrom a combination of the $\\ell_1$ and nuclear norms requires many more\nmeasurements. This proves an order-wise gap between the performance of the\nconvex and nonconvex recovery problems in this case. Our framework applies to\narbitrary structure-inducing norms as well as to a wide range of measurement\nensembles. This allows us to give performance bounds for problems such as\nsparse phase retrieval and low-rank tensor completion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2012 06:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 13:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 06:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-28"}

Continuum emission\nassociated with the central star-forming complex was detected in all these\ngalaxies. The SMA 880 micron flux is decomposed into free-free emission and\ndust emission by using centimetre-wavelength data in the literature. We find\nthat free-free emission contributes half or more of the SMA 880 micron flux in\nthe central starbursts in those three galaxies. In spite of the dominance of\nfree-free emission at 880 micron, the radio-to-far infrared (FIR) ratios in the\ncentral star-forming regions are not significantly higher than those of the\nentire systems, showing the robustness of radio-FIR relation. Based on the\nrobustness of the radio-FIR relation, we argue that the free--free fraction in\nthe 880 micron emission is regulated by the dust temperature.

An example of such\na mechanism is the supernova event, that releases relativistic neutrinos\ncorresponding to 99% of the binding energy of remnant neutron star. We take\nthis phenomena as a starting point for an assumption that similar processes\ncould occur in the dark sector, where structure formation would generate a late\ntime conversion of cold dark matter into a relativistic form of dark matter. We\nperformed a phenomenological study about the limits of this conversion, where\nwe assumed a transition profile that is a generalized version of the neutrino\nproduction in supernovae events. With this assumption, we obtained an\ninteresting modification for the constraint over the cold dark matter density.\nWe show that when comparing with the standard \\Lambda CDM cosmology, there is\nno preference for conversion, although the best fit is within 1\\sigma\\ from the\nstandard model best fit. The methodology and the results obtained qualify this\nconversion hypothesis, from the large scale structure point of view, as a\nviable and interesting model to be tested in the future with small scale data,\nand mitigate discrepancies between observations at this scale and the pure cold\ndark matter model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2012 13:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 12:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2013 13:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-11"}

AIMS: Observable effects of the jet\nclose to the line-of-sight were investigated and interpreted within the frame\nof light curve physics. METHODS: The path of a hypothetical imprint of the jet,\nadvected by the WR-wind, was computed and its crossing with the line-of-sight\nduring the binary orbit determined. We explore the possibility that physically\nthis 'imprint' is a formation of dense clumps triggered by jet bow shocks in\nthe wind (\"clumpy trail\"). Models for X-ray continuum and emission line light\ncurves were constructed using two absorbers: mass columns along the\nline-of-sight of i) the WR wind and ii) the clumpy trail, as seen from the\ncompact star. These model light curves were compared with the observed ones\nfrom the RXTE/ASM (continuum) and Chandra/HETG (emission lines). Results: We\nshow that the shapes of the Cygnus X-3 light curves can be explained by the two\nabsorbers using the inclination and true anomaly angles of the jet as derived\nin Dubus et al. (2010) from gamma-ray Fermi/LAT observations. The clumpy trail\nabsorber is much larger for the lines than for the continuum. We suggest that\nthe clumpy trail is a mixture of equilibrium and hot (shock heated) clumps.\nConclusions: A possible way for studying jets in binary stars when the jet axis\nand the line-of-sight are close to each other is demonstrated. The X-ray\ncontinuum and emission line light curves of Cygnus X-3 can be explained by two\nabsorbers: the WR companion wind plus an absorber lying in the jet path (clumpy\ntrail). We propose that the clumpy trail absorber is due to dense clumps\ntriggered by jet bow shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2012 13:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In\nparticular, we determine the disk regions where the MRI can be shut off either\nby Ohmic resistivity (the so-called Dead and Undead Zones) or by ampipolar\ndiffusion (a region we term the Zombie Zone). We consider 2 stellar masses:\nMstar = 0.7 and 0.1 Msun. In each case, we assume that: the disk surface\ndensity profile is that of a scaled Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, with Mdisk/Mstar\n~ 0.01 as currently estimated; disk ionisation is driven primarily by stellar\nX-rays, complemented by cosmic rays and radionuclides; and the stellar X-ray\nluminosity scales with bolometric luminosity as Lx/Lstar ~ 10^-3.5, as\nobserved. Ionization rates are calculated with the MOCCASIN code, and\nionisation balance determined using a simplified chemical network, including\nwell-mixed 0.1 um grains at various levels of depletion. We find that (1)\nambipolar diffusion is the primary factor controlling MRI activity in disks\naround both solar-type and very low mass stars.
