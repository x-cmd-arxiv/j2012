In contrast to\ndedicated backup servers, nowadays a standard solution, making backups directly\non organization's workstations should be cheaper (as existing hardware is\nused), more efficient (as there is no single bottleneck server) and more\nreliable (as the machines are geographically dispersed).\n  We present the architecture of a p2p backup system that uses pairwise\nreplication contracts between a data owner and a replicator. In contrast to\nstandard p2p storage systems using directly a DHT, the contracts allow our\nsystem to optimize replicas' placement depending on a specific optimization\nstrategy, and so to take advantage of the heterogeneity of the machines and the\nnetwork. Such optimization is particularly appealing in the context of backup:\nreplicas can be geographically dispersed, the load sent over the network can be\nminimized, or the optimization goal can be to minimize the backup/restore time.\nHowever, managing the contracts, keeping them consistent and adjusting them in\nresponse to dynamically changing environment is challenging.\n  We built a scientific prototype and ran the experiments on 150 workstations\nin the university's computer laboratories and, separately, on 50 PlanetLab\nnodes. We found out that the main factor affecting the quality of the system is\nthe availability of the machines. Yet, our main conclusion is that it is\npossible to build an efficient and reliable backup system on highly unreliable\nmachines (our computers had just 13% average availability).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 16:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2013 09:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

To achieve in simulations access to length-scales and\ntime-scales difficult to attain in fully atomistic molecular dynamics, these\ncoarse-grained models provide a reduced description of the molecular degrees of\nfreedom and often remove entirely representation of the solvent degrees of\nfreedom. In such implicit-solvent models the solvent contributions are treated\nthrough effective interaction terms within an effective potential for the free\nenergy. For investigations of kinetics, Langevin dynamics is often used.\nHowever, for many dynamical processes within bilayers this approach is\ninsufficient since it neglects important correlations and dynamical\ncontributions that are missing as a result of the momentum transfer that would\nhave occurred through the solvent. To address this issue, we introduce a new\nthermostat based on fluctuating hydrodynamics for dynamic simulations of\nimplicit-solvent coarse-grained models. Our approach couples the coarse-grained\ndegrees of freedom to a stochastic continuum field that accounts for both the\nsolvent hydrodynamics and thermal fluctuations. We show our approach captures\nimportant correlations in the dynamics of lipid bilayers that are missing in\nsimulations performed using conventional Langevin dynamics. For both planar\nbilayer sheets and bilayer vesicles, we investigate the diffusivity of lipids,\nspatial correlations, and lipid flow within the bilayer. The presented\nfluctuating hydrodynamics approaches provide a promising way to extend\nimplicit-solvent coarse-grained lipid models for use in studies of dynamical\nprocesses within bilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 16:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-28"}

The disc is initially threaded by a weak magnetic field\nwhere the magnetic pressure is significantly less than the kinetic pressure in\nthe disc. The viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are modelled by two \"alpha\"\nparameters, while the coronal region above the disc is treated using ideal MHD.\nThe initial magnetic field is taken to consist of three poloidal field loops\nthreading the disc. The motivation for this study is to understand the\nadvection of disc matter and magnetic field by the turbulent/diffusive disc. At\nearly times the innermost field loop twists and its field lines become open.\nThe twisting of the opened field lines leads to the formation of both an inner\ncollimated, magnetically-dominated jet, and at larger distances from the axis a\nmatter dominated uncollimated wind. For later times, the strength of the\nmagnetic field decreases owing to field reconnection and annihilation in the\ndisc. For the early times, we have derived from the simulations both the matter\naccretion speed in the disc and the accretion speed of the magnetic field. We\nshow that the derived matter accretion speed agrees approximately with the\npredictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of two terms, one\ndue to the disc's viscosity (which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum\nin the disc), and a second due to the twisted magnetic field at the disc's\nsurface (which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum). For early times\nwe find that the magnetic contribution is roughly twice the viscous\ncontribution for the case where the alpha parameters are both equal to 0.1. At\nlater times the magnetic contribution to the matter speed becomes small\ncompared to the viscous contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 17:59:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2013 21:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2013 20:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Choosing as a case study the\ndiscrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation, we consider one-dimensional chains\nwith power-law decaying interactions (with exponent \\alpha) and hoppings (with\nexponent \\beta): An extensive energy is obtained for \\alpha, \\beta>1. We show\nthat the effect of power-law interactions is that of shifting the onset of the\nmodulational instabilities region for \\alpha>1. At a critical value of the\ninteraction strength, the modulational stable region shrinks to zero. Similar\nresults are found for effectively short-range nonlocal hoppings (\\beta > 2): At\nvariance, for longer-ranged hoppings (1 < \\beta < 2) there is no longer any\nmodulational stability. The hopping instability arises for q = 0 perturbations,\nthus the system is most sensitive to the perturbations of the order of the\nsystem's size. We also discuss the stability regions in the presence of the\ninterplay between competing interactions - (e.g., attractive local and\nrepulsive nonlocal interactions). We find that noncompeting nonlocal\ninteractions give rise to a modulational instability emerging for a perturbing\nwave vector q = \\pi while competing nonlocal interactions may induce a\nmodulational instability for a perturbing wave vector 0 < q < \\pi. Since for\n\\alpha > 1 and \\beta > 2 the effects are similar to the effect produced on the\nstability phase diagram by finite range interactions and/or hoppings, we\nconclude that the modulational instability is \"genuinely\" long-ranged for 1 <\n\\beta < 2 nonlocal hoppings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 19:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 10:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-18"}

The evolution of these fields around curved spacetimes is poorly\nunderstood but is expected to display interesting effects. In particular, the\ninteraction of light bosonic fields with supermassive black holes, key players\nin most galaxies, could provide colourful examples of superradiance and\nnonlinear bosenova-like collapse. In turn, the observation of spinning black\nholes is expected to impose stringent bounds on the mass of putative massive\nbosonic fields in our universe. Our purpose here is to present a comprehensive\nstudy of the evolution of linearized massive scalar and vector fields in the\nvicinities of rotating black holes. For a certain boson field mass range, the\nfield can become trapped in a potential barrier outside the horizon and\ntransition to a bound state. Because there are a number of such quasi-bound\nstates, the generic outcome is an amplitude modulated sinusoidal, or beating,\nsignal. We believe that the appearance of such beatings has gone unnoticed in\nthe past, and in fact mistaken for exponential growth. The amplitude modulation\nof the signal depends strongly on the relative excitation of the overtones,\nwhich in turn is strongly tied to the bound-state geography.

We fit the\nemission under the assumption it originates from a circumstellar disc in\nKeplerian rotation. We explore three approaches to modelling the physical\nconditions within the disc - a disc heated mainly via irradiation from the\ncentral star, a disc heated mainly via viscosity, and a disc in which the\ntemperature and density are described analytically. We find that the models\ndescribed by heating mechanisms are inappropriate because they do not provide\ngood fits to the CO emission spectra. We therefore restrict our analysis to the\nanalytic model, and obtain good fits to all objects that possess sufficiently\nstrong CO emission, suggesting circumstellar discs are the source of this\nemission. On average, the temperature and density structure of the discs\ncorrespond to geometrically thin discs, spread across a wide range of\ninclinations. Essentially all the discs are located within the dust sublimation\nradius, providing strong evidence that the CO emission originates close to the\ncentral protostar, on astronomical unit scales.

Both software packages were tested on two kinds of\nsimulated images having, respectively, a uniform spatial distribution of\nsources and an overdensity in the center. In both cases, SExtractor is able to\ngenerate a deeper catalog than DAOPHOT. Moreover, the use of neural networks\nfor object classification plus the novel SPREAD\\_MODEL parameter push down to\nthe limiting magnitude the possibility of star/galaxy separation. DAOPHOT and\nALLSTAR provide an optimal solution for point-source photometry in stellar\nfields and very accurate and reliable PSF photometry, with robust star-galaxy\nseparation. However, they are not useful for galaxy characterization, and do\nnot generate catalogs that are very complete for faint sources. On the other\nhand, SExtractor, along with the new capability to derive PSF photometry, turns\nto be competitive and returns accurate photometry also for galaxies. We can\nassess that the new version of SExtractor, used in conjunction with PSFEx,\nrepresents a very powerful software package for source extraction with\nperformances comparable to those of DAOPHOT. Finally, by comparing the results\nobtained in the case of a uniform and of an overdense spatial distribution of\nstars, we notice, for both software packages, a decline for the latter case in\nthe quality of the results produced in terms of magnitudes and centroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 21:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Second, we show\nthat angular momentum transport in the boundary layer is intrinsically\nnonlocal, and is driven by radiation of angular momentum away from the boundary\nlayer into both the star and the disk. The picture of angular momentum\ntransport in the boundary layer by waves that can travel large distances before\ndissipating and redistributing angular momentum and energy to the disk and star\nis incompatible with the conventional notion of local transport by turbulent\nstresses. Our results have important implications for semianalytical models\nthat describe the spectral emission from boundary layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Dec 2012 22:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Spatial frequency (SF)\ntuning, arguably the most fundamental feature of spatial vision, provides\nparticular intuition within the coarse-to-fine framework: low spatial\nfrequencies convey global information about an image (e.g., general\norientation), while high spatial frequencies carry more detailed information\n(e.g., edges). In this paper, we study the development of cortical spatial\nfrequency tuning. As feedforward input from the lateral geniculate nucleus\n(LGN) has been shown to have significant influence on cortical coarse-to-fine\nprocessing, we present a firing-rate based thalamocortical model which includes\nboth feedforward and feedback components.

They have been observed during years to decades thanks\nto the measurement of stellar magnetic proxies at the surface of the stars such\nas the chromospheric and X-ray emissions, and the measurement of the magnetic\nfield with spectropolarimetry. However, all of these measurements rely on\nexternal features that cannot be visible during for example, a Maunder-type\nminimum. With the advent of long observations provided by space asteroseismic\nmissions, it has been possible to pierce inside the stars and study their\nproperties. Moreover, the acoustic-mode properties are also perturbed by the\npresence of these dynamos. We track the temporal variations of the amplitudes\nand frequencies of acoustic modes allowing us to search for signature of\nmagnetic activity cycles, as has already been done in the Sun and in the CoRoT\ntarget HD49933.

For\nthe MCC problem, it is proved that polynomial time constant factor\napproximation is impossible to obtain \\cite{PT11}.

We study the performance of\ngreedy algorithms for computing these two parameters of $G({\\cal R})$.\nExperimental results shows that for each of the MCC and MIS problems, the\ncorresponding greedy algorithm produces a solution that is very close to its\noptimum solution.

In order to obtain better lower bounds for the natural\npseudo-distance d_G associated with a subgroup G of Homeo(X), we need to adapt\npersistent homology and consider G-invariant persistent homology.

The observations were carried out with the Submillimeter\nArray (SMA) in both the subcompact (SMA-SubC) and extended (SMA-Ext)\nconfigurations at a wavelength of 870 micron. W51 North is resolved into four\ncores (SMA1 to SMA4) in the 870 micron continuum image. The associated dust\npolarization exhibits more complex structures than seen at lower angular\nresolution. We analyze the inferred morphologies of the plane-of-sky magnetic\nfield (B_bot) in the SMA1 to SMA4 cores and in the envelope using the SMA-Ext\nand SMA-SubC data. These results are compared with the B_bot archive images\nobtained from the CSO and JCMT. A correlation between dust intensity gradient\nposition angles (phi_{nabla I}) and magnetic field position angles (phi_B) is\nfound in the CSO, JCMT and both SMA data sets. This correlation is further\nanalyzed quantitatively. A systematically tighter correlation between\nphi_{nabla I} and phi_B is found in the cores, whereas the correlation\ndecreases in outside-core regions. Magnetic field-to-gravity force ratio\n(Sigma_B) maps are derived using the newly developed polarization - intensity\ngradient method by Koch, Tang & Ho 2012. We find that the force ratios tend to\nbe small (Sigma_B <= 0.5) in the cores in all 4 data sets. In regions outside\nof the cores, the ratios increase or the field is even dominating gravity\n(Sigma_B > 1). This possibly provides a physical explanation of the tightening\ncorrelation between phi_{nabla I} and phi_B in the cores: the more the B field\nlines are dragged and aligned by gravity, the tighter the correlation is.\nFinally, we propose a schematic scenario for the magnetic field in W51 North to\ninterpret the four polarization observations at different physical scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 09:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We studied the radio spectrum of PSR\nB1259-63 in an unique binary with Be star LS 2883 and showed that this pulsar\nundergoes a spectrum evolution due to orbital motion. We proposed a qualitative\nmodel which explains this evolution. We considered two mechanisms that might\ninfluence the observed radio emission: free-free absorption and cyclotron\nresonance. According to published results \\citep{kijak2011a}, there were found\nobjects with a new type of pulsar radio spectra, called gigahertz-peaked\nspectra (GPS) pulsars. Most of them were found to exist in very interesting\nenvironments. Therefore, it is suggested that the turnover phenomenon is\nassociated with the environment than being related intrinsically to the radio\nemission mechanism. Having noticed the apparent resemblance between the\nB1259-63 spectrum and the GPS, we suggested that the same mechanisms should be\nresponsible for both cases. Thus, we believe that this binary system can hold\nthe clue to the understanding of gigahertz-peaked spectra of isolated pulsars.\nUsing the same database we constructed spectra for chosen observing days and\nobtained different types of spectra. Comparing to current classification of\npulsar spectra, there occurs a suggestion that the appearance of various\nspectra shapes, different from a simple power law which is typical for radio\npulsars, is possibly caused by environmental conditions around neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 10:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-06"}

Because of a very strong\nredshift-luminosity correlation (Malmquist bias) in a flux-limited sample, any\nredshift-dependent effect could appear as a luminosity related effect and vice\nversa. A question could then arise - do all the morphological differences seen\nin the two classes (FR 1 and 2 types) of sources, usually attributed to the\ndifferences in their luminosities, could as well be primarily a\nredshift-dependent effect? A sharp break in luminosity, seen among the two\nclasses, could after all reflect a sharp redshift-dependence due to a rather\ncritical ambient density value at some cosmic epoch. A doubt on these lines\ndoes not seem to have been raised in past and things have never been examined\nwith this particular aspect in mind. We want to ascertain the customary\nprevalent view in the literature that the systematic differences in the two\nbroad morphology types of FR 1 and 2 radio galaxies are indeed due to the\ndifferences in their luminosities, and not due to a change in redshift. Here we\ninvestigate the dependence of FR 1/2 dichotomy of radio galaxies on luminosity\nand redshift by using the 3CR sample, where the FR 1/2 dichotomy was first\nseen, supplemented by data from an additional sample (MRC), that goes about a\nfactor of 5 or more deeper in flux-density than the original 3CR sample. This\nlets us compare sources with similar luminosities but at different redshifts as\nwell as examine sources at similar redshifts but with different luminosities,\nthereby allowing us a successful separation of the otherwise two intricately\nentangled effects.

It is found that in the\nquasi-hydrostatic cooling phase, while the temperature decreases to about 1/3,\nthe density increases by a factor of 4-6 at the cluster center in comparison\nwith their initial polytropic values, though the profiles over the core depend\non the dark-matter potential. Hence, the core radius in the quasi-hydrostatic\ncooling gas appears to be smaller than that in the initial polytropic gas. We\ncompared the density profile of the cool core with observations to find that,\nwhile the initial density is around the upper bounds of large-core (>100 kpc)\nclusters, most likely relaxed, but the cooling is not yet significant, the\ncentral density under quasi-hydrostatic cooling falls between the mid- and\nhigh-values of small (<100 kpc)- or cool-core clusters. It is also found for\nthe quasi-hydrostatic cooling gas that the entropy profile roughly agrees with\nthe best-fit model to the ACCEPT sample with a low central entropy; also, the\npressure gradient in the inner core is close to that of the REXCESS sample.\nX-ray surface brightness calculated for the quasi-hydrostatic cooling gas is\nwell represented by the conventional double beta-model, giving a physical basis\nfor applying the double beta-model to cool-core clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 10:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 May 2013 10:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

One is that societies want to survive,\nthe second, that individuals in a society would, in general, like to increase\ntheir standard of living. We start by presenting a mathematical model, which\nmay be seen as a particular type of a controlled branching process. All\nconditions of the model are justified and interpreted. After several\npreliminary results about societies in general we can show that two society\nforms should attract particular attention, both from a qualitative and a\nquantitative point of view. These are the so-called weakest-first society and\nthe strongest-first society. In particular we prove then that these two\nsocieties stand out since they form an envelope of all possible societies in a\nsense we will make precise. This result (the envelopment theorem) is seen as\nsignificant because it is paralleled with precise survival criteria for the\nenveloping societies. Moreover, given that one of the \"limiting\" societies can\nbe seen as an extreme form of communism, and the other one as being close to an\nextreme version of capitalism, we conclude that, remarkably, humanity is close\nto having already tested the limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 12:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2013 13:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2013 16:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 08:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-26"}

Traditional optimization methods cannot be\ndirectly applied in these cases, mainly due to memory restrictions.\n  By adopting a slightly different objective function and under mild conditions\non the kernel used within the model, efficient algorithms to train SVMs have\nbeen devised under the name of Core Vector Machines (CVMs). This framework\nexploits the equivalence of the resulting learning problem with the task of\nbuilding a Minimal Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem in a feature space, where data\nis implicitly embedded by a kernel function.\n  In this paper, we improve on the CVM approach by proposing two novel methods\nto build SVMs based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, recently revisited as a fast\nmethod to approximate the solution of a MEB problem. In contrast to CVMs, our\nalgorithms do not require to compute the solutions of a sequence of\nincreasingly complex QPs and are defined by using only analytic optimization\nsteps. Experiments on a large collection of datasets show that our methods\nscale better than CVMs in most cases, sometimes at the price of a slightly\nlower accuracy. As CVMs, the proposed methods can be easily extended to machine\nlearning problems other than binary classification. However, effective\nclassifiers are also obtained using kernels which do not satisfy the condition\nrequired by CVMs and can thus be used for a wider set of problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 12:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

About\n80% of the short orbital period (Porb=3.32 days) was covered as continuously as\npossible for the first time. The source light curve displays variability of\nmore than two orders of magnitude, starting with a very low emission state\nlasting the first 46 ks (1E-13 erg/cm2/s, 1-10 keV), consistent with being due\nto the X-ray eclipse by the supergiant companion. The transition to the\nuneclipsed X-ray emission is energy dependent. Outside the eclipse, the source\nspends most of the time at a level of (6-7)x10^-12 erg/cm2/s punctuated by two\nstructured faint flares with a duration of about 10 and 15 ks. Remarkably, the\nfirst faint flare occurs at a similar orbital phase of the bright flares\npreviously observed in the system. This indicates the presence of a\nphase-locked large scale structure in the supergiant wind, driving a higher\naccretion rate onto the compact object. The scattered component visible during\nthe X-ray eclipse allowed us to directly probe the wind density at the orbital\nseparation, resulting in rho=7E-14 g/cm3. Assuming a spherical geometry for the\nsupergiant wind, the derived wind density translates into a ratio\nMdot_w/v_terminal = 7E-17 solar masses/km which, assuming terminal velocities\nin a large range 500-3000 km/s, implies an accretion luminosity two orders of\nmagnitude higher than that observed.

These high signal-to-noise spectra enable us to examine the nature of\nthis variable, obscured AGN in unprecedented detail on timescales ranging from\nhours to years. We find that, in addition to the power-law continuum and\nabsorption from ionized gas seen in most AGN, inner disk reflection and\nvariable absorption from neutral gas within the Broad Emission Line Region are\nboth necessary components in all three observations. We confirm the clumpy\nnature of the cold absorbing gas, though we note that occultations of the inner\ndisk and corona are much more pronounced in the high-flux state (2008) than in\nthe low-flux state (2010) of the source. The onset and duration of the \"dips\"\nin the X-ray light curve in 2010 are both significantly longer than in 2008,\nhowever, indicating that either the distance to the gas from the black hole is\nlarger, or that the nature of the gas has changed between epochs. We also note\nsignificant variations in the power-law flux over timescales similar to the\ncold absorber, both within and between the three observations. The warm\nabsorber does not vary significantly within observations, but does show\nvariations in column density of a factor of more than 10 on timescales less\nthan 2 weeks that seem unrelated to the changes in the continuum, reflection or\ncold absorber. By assuming a uniform iron abundance for the reflection and\nabsorption, we have also established that an iron abundance of roughly 3.5\ntimes the solar value is sufficient to model the broad-band spectrum without\ninvoking an additional partial-covering absorber. Such a measurement is\nconsistent with previous published constraints from the 2008 Suzaku observation\nalone, and with results from other Seyfert AGN in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 15:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
