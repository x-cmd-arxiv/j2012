It is found that the normalised variability amplitude\n(NVA), measured directly from the power spectrum, is proportional to M^{beta}\nwhere beta ~ -0.54 +/- 0.08. As NVA is the square root of the power, these\nobservations show that the normalisation of the HF power spectrum for this\nsample of AGN varies very close to inversely with black hole mass. Almost the\nsame value of $\\beta$ is obtained whether the quasar 3C273 is included in the\nsample or not, suggesting that the same process that drives X-ray variability\nin Seyfert galaxies applies also to 3C273. These observations support the work\nof Gierlinski et al (2008) who show that an almost exactly linear\nanticorrelation is required if the normalisations of the HF power spectra of\nAGN and X-ray binary systems are to scale similarly. These observations are\nalso consistent with a number of studies showing that the short timescale\nvariance of AGN X-ray lightcurves varies approximately inversely with mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 16:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The routing algorithm ensures that the packets will\nalways reach from source to sink through shortest path and is deadlock free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 16:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-13"}

The proposed technique is based on the behavior of\nlight beams in ring lasers, also known as gyrolasers. A three-dimensional array\nof ringlasers will be attached to a rigid monument; each ring will have a\ndifferent orientation in space. Within the space-time of a rotating mass the\npropagation of light is indeed anisotropic; part of the anisotropy is purely\nkinematical (Sagnac effect), part is due to the interaction between the\ngravito-electric field of the source and the kinematical motion of the observer\n(de Sitter effect), finally there is a contribution from the gravito-magnetic\ncomponent of the Earth (gravito-magnetic frame dragging or Lense-Thirring\neffect). In a ring laser a light beam traveling counterclockwise is superposed\nto another beam traveling in the opposite sense. The anisotropy in the\npropagation leads to standing waves with slightly different frequencies in the\ntwo directions; the final effect is a beat frequency proportional to the size\nof the instrument and its effective rotation rate in space, including the\ngravito-magnetic drag. Current laser techniques and the performances of the\nbest existing ring lasers allow at the moment a sensitivity within one order of\nmagnitude of the required accuracy for the detection of gravito-magnetic\neffects, so that the objective of GINGER is in the range of feasibility and\naims to improve the sensitivity of a couple of orders of magnitude with respect\nto present. The experiment will be underground, probably in the Gran Sasso\nNational Laboratories in Italy, and is based on an international collaboration\namong four Italian groups, the Technische Universitaet Muenchen and the\nUniversity of Canterbury in Christchurch (NZ).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 16:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

For example, OWL 2 DL does not allow a property\nto be both transitive and asymmetric, which would be desirable, e.g., for\nrepresenting an ancestor relation. In this paper, we argue that the so-called\nglobal restrictions of OWL 2 DL preclude many useful forms of modeling, by\nproviding a catalog of basic modeling patterns that would be available in OWL 2\nDL if the global restrictions were discarded. We then report on the results of\nevaluating several state-of-the-art OWL 2 DL reasoners on problems that use\ncombinations of features in a way that the global restrictions are violated.\nThe systems turn out to rely heavily on the global restrictions and are thus\nlargely incapable of coping with the modeling patterns.

Applying a naive\nproof-of-concept implementation of this approach to the test problems was\nsuccessful in all cases.

Unlike cryptography which only scrambles secret\ndata keeping them overt, steganography covers secret data into medium files\nsuch as image files and transmits them in total secrecy avoiding drawing\neavesdroppers suspicions. However, considering that the public channel is\nmonitored by eavesdroppers, it is vulnerable to stego-attacks which refer to\nrandomly trying to break the medium file and recover the secret data out of it.\nThat is often true because steganalysts assume that the secret data are encoded\ninto a single medium file and not into multiple ones that complement each\nother. This paper proposes a text steganography method for hiding secret\ntextual data using two mediums; a Pangram sentence containing all the\ncharacters of the alphabet, and an uncompressed image file. The algorithm tries\nto search for every character of the secret message into the Pangram text. The\nsearch starts from a random index called seed and ends up on the index of the\nfirst occurrence of the character being searched for. As a result, two indexes\nare obtained, the seed and the offset indexes. Together they are embedded into\nthe three LSBs of the color channels of the image medium. Ultimately, both\nmediums mainly the Pangram and the image are sent to the receiver. The\nadvantage of the proposed method is that it makes the covert data hard to be\nrecovered by unauthorized parties as it uses two mediums, instead of one, to\ndeliver the secret data. Experiments conducted, illustrated an example that\nexplained how to encode and decode a secret text message using the Pangram and\nthe image mediums.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 18:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-13"}

We\nprove that for every graph G with n vertices, m edges and no isolated vertices\nthe number of weak isomorphism classes of simple topological graphs that\nrealize G is at most 2^O(n^2 log(m/n)), and at most 2^O(mn^{1/2} log n) if m <\nn^{3/2}. As a consequence we obtain a new upper bound 2^O(n^{3/2} log n) on the\nnumber of intersection graphs of n pseudosegments. We improve the upper bound\non the number of weak isomorphism classes of simple complete topological graphs\nwith n vertices to 2^{n^2 alpha(n)^O(1)}, using an upper bound on the size of a\nset of permutations with bounded VC-dimension recently proved by Cibulka and\nthe author. We show that the number of isomorphism classes of simple\ntopological graphs that realize G is at most 2^{m^2+O(mn)} and at least\n2^Omega(m^2) for graphs with m > (6+epsilon)n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 20:28:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 03:15:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 23:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2022 20:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-13"}

To do so, we generate a suite of\nadaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) simulations for a Milky-Way-massed galaxy run to\nz=0, systematically varying the feedback implementation.

Qualitatively, we find that\nthe hybridization of zinc and oxygen orbitals can result in an impurity state\nwith the energy \\varepsilon, which is lower than the effective Hubbard gap U.\nThe low-energy, spin-only Hamiltonian includes terms of the order t^2/U and\nt^4/\\varepsilon^3.

In\nthis study I use the abundance matching ansatz, which has proven to be\nsuccessful in reproducing galaxy clustering and other statistics, to derive\nestimates of the virial radius, R200, for galaxies of different morphological\ntypes and wide range of stellar mass. I show that over eight of orders of\nmagnitude in stellar mass galaxies of all morphological types follow an\napproximately linear relation between 3D half-mass radius of their stellar\ndistribution, rhalf and virial radius, rhalf~0.015R200 with a scatter of ~0.2\ndex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with expectation of models which\nassume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, which implies\nrhalf\\propto lambda R200, where lambda is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The\nscatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the\ndistribution of $\\lambda$ and normalization of the relation agrees with that\npredicted by the model of Mo, Mao & White (1998), if galaxy sizes were set on\naverage at z~1-2. Moreover, I show that when stellar and gas surface density\nprofiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled using radius\nr_n= 0.015 R200, the rescaled surface density profiles follow approximately\nuniversal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types)\nprofiles with scatter of only 30-50% at R~1-3r_n. Remarkably, both late and\nearly type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles at\nR>r_n. The main difference between their stellar distributions is thus at\nR<r_n. The results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radial\ndistribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent halo\nand that sizes of both late type disks and early type spheroids are controlled\nby halo angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 21:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 20:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Purpose: Measure the\ndifferential cross section for elastic scattering of neutrons from argon and\nneon in the energy range relevant to backgrounds from (alpha,n) reactions in\ndirect dark matter searches. Method: Cross-section data were taken at the\nTriangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) using the neutron\ntime-of-flight technique. These data were fit using the spherical optical\nmodel. Results: The differential cross section for elastic scatting of neutrons\nfrom neon at 5.0 and 8.0 MeV and argon at 6.0 MeV was measured. Optical-model\nparameters for the elastic scattering reactions were determined from the best\nfit to these data. The total elastic scattering cross section for neon was\nfound to differ by 6% at 5.0 MeV and 13% at 8.0 MeV from global optical-model\npredictions. Compared to a local optical-model for 40Ar, the elastic scattering\ncross section was found to differ from the data by 8% at 6.0 MeV.

The classical\ndiffusion process can be viewed as a result of a random walk of particles in\nwhich every step has the same probability distribution with a finite second\nmoment. This allows applying the central limit theorem to the calculation of\nthe particle distribution after many steps. However, in moderately doped\ndirect-gap semiconductors the photon recycling process can radically modify the\nspatial spread. For this process, the steps in the random walk are defined by\nthe reabsorption length of photons produced in radiative recombination. The\nstep distribution has an asymptotic power-law decline. Moments of this\ndistribution diverge and the displacement is governed by rare but large steps.\nRandom walk of this kind is called the Levy flight. It corresponds to an\nanomalously large spread in space and a modified (\"super-diffusive\") temporal\nevolution. Here we discuss the first direct observation of the hole profile in\nn-doped InP samples over distances of the order of a centimeter and more than\ntwo orders of magnitude in hole concentration. Luminescence spectra and\nintensity were studied as a function of distance from the photo-excitation in a\nrather unusual geometry (homogeneous excitation of the wafer edge and\nobservation of the luminescence spectra from the broadside). The intensity is\nproportional to the minority-carrier concentration and exhibits a slow\npower-law drop-off with no changes in the spectral shape. This power law gives\na direct evidence of Levy-flight transport.

However, the morphodynamics of sediment landscapes emerging due to\nsurface transport of sediment is controlled by situations out-of-equilibrium.\nIn particular, it is controlled by the saturation length characterizing the\ndistance it takes for the particle flux to reach a new equilibrium after a\nchange in flow conditions. The saturation of mass density of particles\nentrained into transport and the relaxation of particle and fluid velocities\nconstitute the main relevant relaxation mechanisms leading to saturation of the\nsediment flux. Here we present a theoretical model for sediment transport\nwhich, for the first time, accounts for both these relaxation mechanisms and\nfor the different types of sediment entrainment prevailing under different\nenvironmental conditions.

Unfortunately, the\nmass loss during the red giant stages of the stellar evolution is poorly\nunderstood at present. The stellar winds of red giants may be tidally enhanced\nby companion stars if they are in binary systems. We investigate evolutionary\nconsequences of red giants in binaries by including tidally enhanced stellar\nwinds, and examine the effects on the HB morphology of GCs. We find that red,\nblue, and extreme horizontal branch stars are all produced under the effects of\ntidally enhanced stellar wind without any additional assumptions on the\nmass-loss dispersion. Furthermore, the horizontal branch morphology is found to\nbe insensitive to the tidal enhancement parameter, Bw. We compare our\ntheoretical results with the observed horizontal branch morphology of globular\ncluster NGC 2808, and find that the basic morphology of the horizontal branch\ncan be well reproduced.

Because of the no-slip boundary condition at the cell\nsurface, the upper stroke away from the boundary generates leftward flow, and\nthe lower stroke close to the boundary generates slower rightward flow. By\ncombining computational fluid dynamics with experimental observations, we\ndemonstrate that the leftward stroke can be more effective than expected for\ncases in which cilia tilting alone is considered with the no-slip condition\nunder constant driving force. Our results suggest that the driving force is\nasymmetric and that it is determined by the tilting angle and open angle of the\nrotating cilia. Specifically, it is maximized in the leftward stroke when the\ncilia moves comparatively far from the boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 08:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 03:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-22"}

In this era of nanotechnologies, coupled\noscillations have again emerged as subjects of interest when realized in\nnanomechanical resonators for both practical applications and fundamental\nstudies. However, a key obstacle to the further development of this\narchitecture is the ability to coherently manipulate the coupled oscillations.\nThis limitation arises as a consequence of the usually weak coupling between\nthe constituent nanomechanical elements. Here, we report parametrically coupled\nmechanical resonators in which the coupling strength can be dynamically\nadjusted by modulating (pumping) the stress in the mechanical elements via a\npiezoelectric transducer. The parametric control enables the coupling rate\nbetween the two resonators to be made so strong that it exceeds their intrinsic\nenergy dissipation rate by more than a factor of four. This ultra-strong\ncoupling can be exploited to coherently transfer phonon populations, namely\nphonon Rabi oscillations, between the resonators via two coupled vibration\nmodes, realizing superposition states of the two modes and their time-domain\ncontrol. More unexpectedly, the nature of the parametric coupling can also be\ntuned from a linear first-order interaction to a non-linear higher-order\nprocess in which more than one pump phonon mediates the coherent oscillations.\nThis demonstration of multi-pump phonon mixing echoes multi-wave photon mixing\nand suggests that concepts from non-linear optics can also be applied to\nmechanical systems. Ultimately, the parametric pumping is not only useful for\ncontrolling classical oscillations but can also be extended to the quantum\nregime, opening up the prospect of entangling two distinct macroscopic\nmechanical objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 09:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The reasoning behind this\n\"reactive motion\" was that when water vapor condenses and droplets begin to\nfall the remaining gas must move upwards to conserve momentum. Here we show\nthat the two contrasting formulations imply distinct assumptions about how\ngaseous air and condensate particles interact. We show that these assumptions\ncannot be simultaneously applicable to condensation and evaporation. \"Reactive\nmotion\" leading to an upward acceleration of air during condensation does not\nexist. The \"reactive motion\" term can be justified for evaporation only; it\ndescribes the downward acceleration of air. We emphasize the difference between\nthe equations of motion (i.e., equations constraining velocity) and those\nconstraining momentum (i.e., equations of motion and continuity combined). We\nshow that, owing to the imprecise nature of the continuity equations,\nconsideration of total momentum can be misleading and that this led to the\n\"reactive motion\" controversy. Finally, we provide a revised and generally\napplicable equation for the motion of moist air.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 09:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2013 13:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 04:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 08:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

Although their phenomenology is much\ndiverse, the similar periods (P=2--10 s) and magnetic fields (~10^{14} G)\nsuggest that XDINSs are evolved magnetars, possibly born from similar\npopulations of supermassive stars. One way to test this hypothesis is to\nidentify their parental star clusters by extrapolating backward the neutron\nstar velocity vector in the Galactic potential. By using the information on the\nage and space velocity of the XDINS RX J1856.5-3754, we computed backwards its\norbit in the Galactic potential and searched for its parental stellar cluster\nby means of a closest approach criterion. We found a very likely association\nwith the Upper Scorpius OB association, for a neutron star age of 0.42+/-0.08\nMyr, a radial velocity V_r^NS =67+/- 13$ km s^{-1}, and a present-time\nparallactic distance d_\\pi^NS = 123^{+11}_{-15} pc. Our result confirms that\nthe \"true\" neutron star age is much lower than the spin-down age (tau_{sd}=3.8\nMyrs), and is in good agreement with the cooling age, as computed within\nstandard cooling scenarios. The mismatch between the spin-down and the\ndynamical/cooling age would require either an anomalously large breaking index\n(n~20) or a decaying magnetic field with initial value B_0 ~ 10^{14} G.\nUnfortunately, owing to the uncertainty on the age of the Upper Scorpius OB\nassociation and the masses of its members we cannot yet draw firm conclusions\non the estimated mass of the RX J1856.5-3754 progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 11:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, unlike superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect,\nwhich necessitate low temperatures or magnetic fields, the immunity to disorder\nof topological insulators occurs at room temperature and without any external\nmagnetic field. For this reason, topological protection is predicted to have\nwide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics.\nRecently, a large theoretical effort has been directed towards bringing the\nconcept into the domain of photonics: achieving topological protection of light\nat optical frequencies. Besides the interesting new physics involved, photonic\ntopological insulators hold the promise for applications in optical isolation\nand robust photon transport.

The system is composed of an array of helical\nwaveguides, evanescently coupled to one another, and arranged in a\ngraphene-like honeycomb lattice.

In this paper, we propose a novel\ngame-theoretic model that enables the SBSs to optimize their transmission rates\nby making decisions on the resource occupation jointly in the frequency and\nspatial domains. This procedure, known as interference draining, is performed\namong cooperative SBSs and allows to drastically reduce the interference\nexperienced by both macro- and small cell users.

It is commonly employed to visualise a broad variety of\nphenomena ranging from spin ensembles and atoms to quantum dots and\nsuperconducting circuits. The underlying Bloch equations describe the state\nevolution of the two-level system and allow characterising both energy and\nphase relaxation processes in a simple yet powerful manner.\n  Here we demonstrate the realisation of a nanomechanical two-level system\nwhich is driven by radio frequency signals. It allows to extend the above Bloch\nsphere formalism to nanoelectromechanical systems. Our realisation is based on\nthe two orthogonal fundamental flexural modes of a high quality factor\nnanostring resonator which are strongly coupled by a dielectric gradient field.\nFull Bloch sphere control is demonstrated via Rabi, Ramsey and Hahn echo\nexperiments. This allows manipulating the classical superposition state of the\ncoupled modes in amplitude and phase and enables deep insight into the\ndecoherence mechanisms of nanomechanical systems. We have determined the energy\nrelaxation time T1 and phase relaxation times T2 and T2*, and find them all to\nbe equal. This not only indicates that energy relaxation is the dominating\nsource of decoherence, but also demonstrates that reversible dephasing\nprocesses are negligible in such collective mechanical modes. We thus conclude\nthat not only T1 but also T2 can be increased by engineering larger mechanical\nquality factors. After a series of ground-breaking experiments on ground state\ncooling and non-classical signatures of nanomechanical resonators in recent\nyears, this is of particular interest in the context of quantum information\nprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 13:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-19"}

We demonstrate that this transition is accessible by numerical\ntransfer matrix calculations in 1+1 dimensions and analyze the properties of\nthe disorder-dominated phase.

On the basis of the analysis\nof properties of models of rigid and semirigid rotators, the theory of soft\nrotators is formulated where the harmonic attractive force is balanced only by\nthe centrifugal force. As examples a Coulomb rotator (the Bohr model) and a\nmagneto-harmonic rotator (the Fock-Landau levels) are considered. Disappearance\nof the radial speed in the model of a magneto-harmonic rotator is taken as a\ndefining property of a pure rotational motion in the harmonic potential. After\nthe exception of energies of the magnetic and spin decompositions, specific to\nmagnetic fields, one turns to a simple and general model of a planar harmonic\nrotator (circular oscillator without radial speed) where kinetic energy is\nreduced to the purely rotational energy. Energy levels of the harmonic rotator\nhave the same frequency and are twice degenerate, the energy spectrum is\nequidistant. In the ground state there is no zero-point energy from rotational\nmodes, and the zero-point energy of vibrational modes can be compensated by\nspin effects or symmetries of the system. In this case the operators of\nobservables vanish the ground state, i.e. are \"strongly\" normally ordered. In a\nchain of harmonic rotators collective rotations around a common axis lead to\ntransverse waves, at quantization of which there appear quasi-particles and\nholes carrying an angular momentum. In the chain SU(2) appears as a group of\nsymmetry of a rotator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 18:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-14"}
