Each agent acts to\nminimize Bayes risk, with all agents sharing the same Bayes costs for Type I\n(false alarm) and Type II (missed detection) errors. The effect of the set of\ninitial beliefs on the decision-making performance of the last agent is\nstudied. The last agent makes the best decision when the initial beliefs are\ninaccurate. When the private signals are described by Gaussian likelihoods, the\noptimal initial beliefs are not haphazard but rather follow a systematic\npattern: the earlier-acting agents should act as if the prior probability is\nlarger than it is in reality when the true prior probability is small, and vice\nversa. We interpret this as being open minded toward the unlikely hypothesis.\nThe early-acting agents face a trade-off between making a correct decision and\nbeing maximally informative to the later-acting agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2012 05:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

As suggested by Kijak et al. (Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 418:L114,\n2011a) this binary system can be useful in understanding the origin of the\ngigahertz-peaked spectrum of pulsars. The model explains, at least\nqualitatively, the observed alterations of the spectral shape depending on the\norbital phases of this pulsar. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that\nthe external factors have a significant impact on the observed radio emission\nof a pulsar. The model can also contribute to our understanding of the origin\nof some non-typical spectral shapes(e.g. flat or broken spectra).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2012 14:07:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 14:12:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 10:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

These games were\npreviously studied by Roth, Balcan, Kalai and Mansour. They presented an FPTAS\nfor computing an approximated equilibrium, and conjectured that there is a\npolynomial algorithm for finding an exact equilibrium. We extend their study in\ntwo directions: (1) We show that finding an exact equilibrium, even for\ntwo-player zero-sum games, is polynomial time equivalent to finding a winning\nstrategy for a (two-player) mean-payoff game on graphs. The existence of a\npolynomial algorithm for the latter is a long standing open question in\ncomputer science. Our hardness result for two-player games suggests that\ntwo-player alternating move games are harder to solve than two-player\nsimultaneous move games, while the work of Roth et al., suggests that for\n$k\\geq 3$, $k$-player games are easier to analyze in the alternating move\nsetting. (2) We show that optimal equilibriums (with respect to the social\nwelfare metric) can be obtained by pure strategies, and we present an FPTAS for\ncomputing a pure approximated equilibrium that is $\\delta$-optimal with respect\nto the social welfare metric. This result extends the previous work by\npresenting an FPTAS that finds a much more desirable approximated equilibrium.\nWe also show that if there is a polynomial algorithm for mean-payoff games on\ngraphs, then there is a polynomial algorithm that computes an optimal exact\nequilibrium, and hence, (two-player) mean-payoff games on graphs are\ninter-reducible with $k$-player alternating move games, for any $k\\geq 2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2012 14:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 14:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-25"}
