From the international AFOEV database, 6231\nbrightness values in the time interval JD 2451602-55378 were chosen. For the\nperiodogram analysis, we have used a trigonometric polynomial fit. Using the\ncriterion of minimal variance of the approximation at arguments of\nobservations, the optimal degree is s=1. Initial epoch for maximum is\nT0=JD2453340(3), the period P=1198(4)d. Mean brightness at maximum is 6.624(5),\nat minimum 7.124(5), i.e. the amplitude is 0.499(5)m. Besides this slow\nvariability, there is a faster oscillation of a period of 119.45(6)d, amplitude\n0.303(5)m and an initial epoch for maximum 2453215.1(5). These results are mean\nduring the time interval after that analyzed in the catalogue of Chinarova and\nAndronov (2000). Also the method of \"running sines\" with a filter half-width\nDelta t=0.5P. The local mean (averaged over a short period) brightness varies\nin a range 6.58-7.41m, the semi-amplitude exhibits very strong variations from\n0.01 to 0.46m. The phase is also variable - typically of a full amplitude of\n0.5. Close to JD 2452589, occurred a phase jump by a complete period during a\ndescending branch of a slow wave. This effect was not observed during other\ncycles. No significant correlation between mean brightness and amplitude of\nshort-period oscillation was found. Despite significant variability of\namplitude, the periodic contribution is not statistically significant. Also\ncharacteristics of individual brightness extrema were found. The study was made\nin a course of the international project \"Inter-Longitude Astronomy\" (Andronov\net al., 2010) and national project \"Ukrainian Virtual Observatory (Vavilova et\nal., 2012).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Dec 2012 16:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

It is therefore important to\ndesign effective and practical econometric methods for testing this prediction\nin empirical analysis. This paper develops a general nonparametric framework\nfor testing monotonicity of a regression function. Using this framework, a\nbroad class of new tests is introduced, which gives an empirical researcher a\nlot of flexibility to incorporate ex ante information she might have. The paper\nalso develops new methods for simulating critical values, which are based on\nthe combination of a bootstrap procedure and new selection algorithms. These\nmethods yield tests that have correct asymptotic size and are asymptotically\nnonconservative. It is also shown how to obtain an adaptive rate optimal test\nthat has the best attainable rate of uniform consistency against models whose\nregression function has Lipschitz-continuous first-order derivatives and that\nautomatically adapts to the unknown smoothness of the regression function.\nSimulations show that the power of the new tests in many cases significantly\nexceeds that of some prior tests, e.g. that of Ghosal, Sen, and Van der Vaart\n(2000).

In\ninformation processing, the entropy production is positive for random\ntransformation of signals (the information processing lemma). Originally, the\n$H$-theorem and the information processing lemma were proved for the classical\nBoltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy and for the correspondent divergence (the\nrelative entropy). Many new entropies and divergences have been proposed during\nlast decades and for all of them the $H$-theorem is needed. This note proposes\na simple and general criterion to check whether the $H$-theorem is valid for a\nconvex divergence $H$ and demonstrates that some of the popular divergences\nobey no $H$-theorem. We consider systems with $n$ states $A_i$ that obey first\norder kinetics (master equation). A convex function $H$ is a Lyapunov function\nfor all master equations with given equilibrium if and only if its conditional\nminima properly describe the equilibria of pair transitions $A_i\n\\rightleftharpoons A_j$. This theorem does not depend on the principle of\ndetailed balance and is valid for general Markov kinetics. Elementary analysis\nof pair equilibria demonstrates that the popular Bregman divergences like\nEuclidean distance or Itakura-Saito distance in the space of distribution\ncannot be the universal Lyapunov functions for the first-order kinetics and can\nincrease in Markov processes. Therefore, they violate the second law and the\ninformation processing lemma.

The\nnumber of bound states can be controlled by tuning the size of the QD and the\nmagnitude of the core and bulk energy gaps, which determine the confining\npotential.

It is of practical\nimportance to verify if precision measurements with lep- tons in the final\nstate require all theoretical effects evaluated simultaneously or if QED\nbremsstrahlung in the final state can be separated without unwanted precision\nloss. Results for final state bremsstrahlung in the decays of narrow resonances\nare obtained from the Feynman rules of QED in an unambiguous way and can be\ncontrolled with a very high precision. Also for resonances of non-negligible\nwidth, if calculations are appropriately performed, such separation from the\nremaining electroweak effects can be expected. Our paper is devoted to\nvalidation that final state QED bremsstrahlung can indeed be separated from the\nrest of QCD and electroweak effects, in the production and decay of Z and W\nbosons, and to estimation of the resulting systematic error. The quantitative\ndiscussion is based on Monte Carlo programs PHOTOS and SANC, as well as on KKMC\nwhich is used for benchmark results.

We furthermore provide a Tannakian interpretation of the\ncanonical reduction in characteristic 0 which allows to study its behavior in\nfamilies. The substack structures on the strata are defined directly in terms\nof Drinfeld's compactifications, which we generalize to the case where the\nderived group of G is not necessarily simply connected. We furthermore use\nDrinfeld's compactifications to establish various properties of the\nstratification, including finer information about the structure of the\nindividual strata and a simple description of the strata closures. Finally, we\nintroduce a novel notion of slope for principal bundles which allows for a\nnatural formulation of the reduction theory of arbitrary reductive groups in\narbitrary characteristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 03:28:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 01:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

The g%SD criterion measures the fit of data to model based on a\nnormalized weighted root mean square percentage deviation between the observed\ndata and model estimates of the data, with g%SD = 0 being a perfectly fitting\nmodel. However, this criterion may not be adjusting for the number of\nparameters in the model comprehensively. Thus, its relationship to more\ntraditional measures for maximizing useful information in a model, including\nAIC and BIC, are examined. This results in an extended set of fit criteria\nincluding g%AIC and g%BIC. Further, a broader range of asymptotically most\npowerful fit criteria of the power divergence family, which includes maximum\nlikelihood (or minimum G^2) and minimum X^2 modeling as special cases, are used\nto replace the sum of squares fit criterion within the g%SD criterion. Results\nare illustrated with a set of genetic distances looking particularly at a range\nof Jewish populations, plus a genomic data set that looks at how Neanderthals\nand Denisovans are related to each other and modern humans.

However, no unambiguous experimental evidences for the\nexistence of FFLO phases have been observed yet. Recently, spin-imbalanced\nultracold degenerate Fermi gases have emerged as a new powerful platform for\nthe observation of FFLO phases due to their high experimental controllability\nand the lack of disorder. However, in three dimensional degenerate Fermi gases\nwhere the FFLO phases can be described within the simple mean field theory, the\nparameter region for the FFLO phases is too small to be observed in\nexperiments. Recently, we showed that the Rashba type spin-orbit coupling and\nin-plane Zeeman field in three dimensional degenerate Fermi gases provide a\nmore efficient way to create the FFLO phase because (1) the parameter region\nfor the FFLO phase is greatly enlarged in the phase diagram and (2) the FFLO\nphase is stabilized due to the enhanced energy difference between FFLO phase\nand conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase. In this work we\ninvestigate the FFLO phase in two dimensional spin-orbit coupled degenerate\nFermi gases using the mean field theory, with special concerns on the physical\norigin of the FFLO state. The basic properties of the FFLO phase are discussed\nand the phase diagram is obtained at zero temperature.

Within this paper, we present\nmethods that enable a mobile manipulator to autonomously learn a function that\ntakes an RGB image and a registered 3D point cloud as input and returns a 3D\nlocation at which a manipulation behavior is likely to succeed. Given a pair of\nmanipulation behaviors that can change the state of the world between two sets\n(e.g., light switch up and light switch down), classifiers that detect when\neach behavior has been successful, and an initial hint as to where one of the\nbehaviors will be successful, the robot autonomously trains a pair of support\nvector machine (SVM) classifiers by trying out the behaviors at locations in\nthe world and observing the results. When an image feature vector associated\nwith a 3D location is provided as input to one of the SVMs, the SVM predicts if\nthe associated manipulation behavior will be successful at the 3D location. To\nevaluate our approach, we performed experiments with a PR2 robot from Willow\nGarage in a simulated home using behaviors that flip a light switch, push a\nrocker-type light switch, and operate a drawer.

For proper-motion member\nstars, the membership probability estimated using the polarimetric data is in\ngood agreement with the proper-motion cluster membership probability. However,\nfor proper-motion non-member stars, the membership probability estimated by the\npolarimetric method is in total disagreement with the proper-motion cluster\nmembership probability. The inconsistencies in the determined memberships may\nbe because of the fundamental differences between the two methods of\ndetermination: one is based on stellar proper-motion in space and the other is\nbased on selective extinction of the stellar output by the asymmetric aligned\ndust grains present in the interstellar medium.

In an example evaluation of a particular model it is shown\nthat the proposed evaluation measures are very sensitive to parameter changes\nand therefore summarize differences effects of parameter changes and\ndifferences between models efficiently, sometimes in a single number. It is\nshown how the symmetry which exists in the achiral geometry of the proposed\nexample scenario is broken in particular simulation runs exhibiting chiral\ndynamics, while in the statistics of 1,000 simulation runs there is a symmetry\nbetween left- and right-chiral dynamics.

We investigate the evaluation of RPQs with an additional constraint\nthat prevents multiple traversals of the same nodes. Those regular simple path\nqueries (RSPQs) find several applications in practice, yet they quickly become\nintractable, even for basic languages such as (aa)* or a*ba*.\n  In this paper, we establish a comprehensive classification of regular\nlanguages with respect to the complexity of the corresponding regular simple\npath query problem. More precisely, we identify the fragment that is maximal in\nthe following sense: regular simple path queries can be evaluated in polynomial\ntime for every regular language L that belongs to this fragment and evaluation\nis NP-complete for languages outside this fragment. We thus fully characterize\nthe frontier between tractability and intractability for RSPQs, and we refine\nour results to show the following trichotomy: Evaluations of RSPQs is either\nAC0, NL-complete or NP-complete in data complexity, depending on the regular\nlanguage L. The fragment identified also admits a simple characterization in\nterms of regular expressions.\n  Finally, we also discuss the complexity of the following decision problem:\ndecide, given a language L, whether finding a regular simple path for L is\ntractable.

The sensitivity of the LHeC to the new physics scale is also briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 11:51:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2013 06:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-17"}

Based on the advanced, realistic\nFokker-Planck (FP) approach, we predict theoretically the initial size\ndistribution (SD) of the Galactic GCs along with their initial mass function\nand radial distribution. Over one thousand FP calculations in a wide parameter\nspace have pinpointed the best-fit initial conditions for the SD, mass\nfunction, and radial distribution. Our best-fit model shows that the initial SD\nof the Galactic GCs is of larger dispersion than today's SD, and that typical\nprojected half-light radius of the initial GCs is ~4.6 pc, which is 1.8 times\nlarger than that of the present-day GCs (~2.5 pc). Their large size signifies\ngreater susceptibility to the Galactic tides: the total mass of destroyed GCs\nreaches 3-5x10^8 M_sun$, several times larger than the previous estimates. Our\nresult challenges a recent view that the Milky Way GCs were born compact on the\nsub-pc scale, and rather implies that (1) the initial GCs are generally larger\nthan the typical size of the present-day GCs, (2) the initially large GCs\nmostly shrink and/or disrupt as a result of the galactic tides, and (3) the\ninitially small GCs expand by two-body relaxation, and later shrink by the\ngalactic tides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 11:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The\nYarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect causes changes in the\nrotation rate and pole direction of an irregularly shaped asteroid. We present\na simple Monte Carlo method to estimate the range of\nYORP-rotational-accelerations acting on a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) without\nknowledge of its detailed shape, and to estimate its detectability using\nlight-curve observations. The method requires knowledge of an asteroid's\norbital properties and size, and assumes that the future observational\ncircumstances of an asteroid have already been thought through. It is verified\nby application to the observational circumstances of the seven\nYORP-investigated asteroids, and is then applied to 540 NEAs with NEOWISE\nand/or other diameter measurements, and to all NEAs using MPCORB absolute\nmagnitudes. The YORP-detectability is found to be a strong function of the\ncombined asteroid orbital and diameter properties, and is independent of the\nrotation period for NEAs that don't have very fast or slow rotation rates. The\nmedian and 1-sigma spread of YORP-rotational-acceleration expected to be acting\non a particular NEA can be estimated from its semimajor axis, eccentricity, and\ndiameter by using (eq. 1) and/or by using (eq. 2) if the diameter is instead\nestimated from the absolute magnitude by assuming a geometric albedo of 0.1.\nThe length of a light-curve observational campaign required to achieve a 50 per\ncent probability of detecting the YORP effect in a particular NEA can be\nestimated by using (eq. 3) and/or by using (eq. 4) for an\nabsolute-magnitude-estimated diameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 13:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This result applies when the dimension of random vectors\n($p$) is large compared to the sample size ($n$); in fact, $p$ can be much\nlarger than $n$, without restricting correlations of the coordinates of these\nvectors. We also show that the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the\nrandom vectors with unknown covariance matrices can be consistently estimated\nby the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the conditional Gaussian random\nvectors obtained by multiplying the original vectors with i.i.d.

The so-called activity-rotation\nrelation is usually attributed to changes in the underlying dynamo processes\ngenerating the magnetic field. We examine the dependence of the field strength\non rotation in global numerical dynamo models and interpret our results on the\nbasis of energy considerations. In agreement with the scaling law proposed by\nChristensen & Aubert (2006), the field strength in our simulations is set by\nthe fraction of the available power used for the magnetic field generation.\nThis is controlled by the dynamo efficiency calculated as the ratio of Ohmic to\ntotal dissipation in our models. The dynamo efficiency grows strongly with\nincreasing rotation rate at a Rossby number of 0.1 until it reaches its upper\nbound of one and becomes independent of rotation. This gain in efficiency is\nrelated to the strong rotational dependence of the mean electromotive force in\nthis parameter regime. For multipolar models at Rossby numbers clearly larger\nthan 0.1, on the other hand, we do not find a systematic dependence of the\nfield strength on rotation. Whether the enhancement of the dynamo efficiency\nfound in our dipolar models explains the observed activity-rotation relation\nneeds to be further assessed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2012 15:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}
