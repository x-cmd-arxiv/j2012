A prominent example is the\npresence of topologically protected extended-states in two-dimensional (2D)\nquantum Hall systems as well as on the surface of three-dimensional (3D)\ntopological insulators. Distinct from such cases, here we introduce a new\nconcept, that is, the topological protection of bound states against\nhybridization. This situation is shown to be realizable in a 2D quantum Hall\ninsulator put on a 3D trivial insulator. In such a configuration, there exist\ntopologically protected bound states, localized along the normal direction of\n2D plane, in spite of hybridization with the continuum of extended states. The\none-dimensional edge states are also localized along the same direction as long\nas their energies are within the band gap. This finding demonstrates the dual\nrole of topological invariants, as they can also protect bound states against\nhybridization in a continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 13:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2012 06:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The hierarchical model\nfollows the natural organization of population data and the top level in the\nhierarchy provides a common frame of reference for multigroup shape analysis,\ne.g. classification and hypothesis testing. Unlike typical shape-modeling\napproaches, the proposed model is a generative model that defines a joint\ndistribution of object-boundary data and the shape-model variables.\nFurthermore, it naturally enforces optimal correspondences during the process\nof model fitting and thereby subsumes the so-called correspondence problem.

One open issue is that of obtaining estimates for the rate of\ne-captures on 7Be, for T and rho conditions different from solar. This is\nimportant to model the Galactic nucleosynthesis of Li. In this framework, we\npresent a new theoretical method for calculating the e-capture rate in\nconditions typical of evolved stars. We show how our approach compares with\nstate-of-the-art techniques for solar conditions, where various estimates are\navailable. Our computations include: i) \"traditional\" calculations of the\nelectronic density at the nucleus, to which the e-capture rate for 7Be is\nproportional, for different theoretical approaches including the Thomas--Fermi,\nPoisson--Boltzmann and Debye--Hueckel (DH) models of screening, ii) a new\ncomputation, based on a formalism that goes beyond the previous ones, adopting\na mean-field \"adiabatic\" approximation to the scattering process. The results\nobtained with our approach as well as with the traditional ones and their\ndifferences are discussed in some detail, starting from solar conditions, where\nour method and the DH model converge to the same solution. We then analyze the\napplicability of the various models to a rather broad range of T and rho\nvalues, embracing those typical of red giant stars.

We use radio observations of 66 spiral galaxies to test the dark\nmatter origin of the haze.

For reasonable ranges for the\nvariation of these parameters, we estimate the fraction of galaxies that should\nbe expected to be significantly less bright in radio, and argue that this is\nmarginally compatible with the observed distribution. While our findings\ntherefore cannot rule out a dark matter origin for the radio haze at this time,\nwe find numerous examples (including the Andromeda Galaxy) where, if dark\nmatter is indeed the origin of the Milky Way haze, some mechanism must be in\nplace to suppress the corresponding haze of the external galaxy.

In\nsuch circumstances, selection of this best model is achieved using a model\nselection criterion, most often the Bayesian information criterion. Rather than\nthrow away all but the best model, we average multiple models that are in some\nsense close to the best one, thereby producing a weighted average of clustering\nresults. Two (weighted) averaging approaches are considered: averaging the\ncomponent membership probabilities and averaging models.

Previous works have demonstrated the conservativeness of the\ninverse of the product of the fresh leaf density and thickness, the so-called\nHughes constant, K. We use this fact to develop LAMM, an absolute method of LA\nmeasurement, i.e. no regression fits or prior calibrations with planimeters.\nNor does it require drying the leaves. The concept involves the in situ\ndetermination of K using geometrical shapes and their weights obtained from a\nsubset of fresh leaves of the set whose areas are desired. Subsequently the\nLAs, at any desired stratification level, are derived by utilizing K and the\npreviously measured masses of the fresh leaves. The concept was first tested in\nthe simulated ideal case of complete planarity and uniform thickness by using\nplastic film covered card-paper sheets. Next the species-specific\nconservativeness of K over individual leaf zones and different leaf types from\nleaves of plants from two species, Mandevilla splendens and Spathiphyllum\nwallisii, was quantitatively validated. Using the global average K values, the\nLA of these and additional plants, were obtained. LAMM was found to be a rapid,\nsimple, economic technique with accuracies, as measured for the geometrical\nshapes, that were comparable to those obtained by the planimetric method that\nutilizes digital image analysis, DIA. For the leaves themselves, there were no\nstatistically significant differences between the LAs measured by LAMM and by\nthe DIA and the linear correlation between the two methods was excellent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 04:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-06"}

In the velocity range studied here, the drag force on\nthe cylinder does not depend on the velocity V_0 and is mainly proportional to\nthe cylinder diameter d. Whereas the force on the cylinder increases with its\npenetration depth, the granular velocity profile around the cylinder is found\nstationary with fluctuations around a mean value leading to the granular\ntemperature profile. Both mean velocity profile and temperature profile exhibit\nstrong localization near the cylinder. The mean flow perturbation induced by\nthe cylinder decreases exponentially away from the cylinder on a characteristic\nlength \\lambda, that is mainly governed by the cylinder diameter for large\nenough cylinder/grain size ratio d/d_g: \\lambda ~ d/4 + 2d_g. The granular\ntemperature exhibits a constant plateau value T_0 in a thin layer close to the\ncylinder of extension \\delta_{T_0} ~ \\lambda/2 and decays exponentially far\naway with a characteristic length \\lambda_T of a few grain diameters (\\lambda_T\n~ 3d_g). The granular temperature plateau T_0 that scales as (V_0^2 d_g/d) is\ncreated by the flow itself from the balance between the \"granular heat\"\nproduction by the shear rate V_0/\\lambda over \\delta_{T_0} close to the\ncylinder and the granular dissipation far away.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 10:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2013 15:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-11"}

Of particular importance is the case where f(X)\nis a function of independent random variables X=(X_1, ..., X_n). Here the well\nknown bounded differences inequality (also called McDiarmid's or\nHoeffding-Azuma inequality) establishes sharp concentration if the function f\ndoes not depend too much on any of the variables. One attractive feature is\nthat it relies on a very simple Lipschitz condition (L): it suffices to show\nthat |f(X)-f(X')| \\leq c_k whenever X,X' differ only in X_k. While this is easy\nto check, the main disadvantage is that it considers worst-case changes c_k,\nwhich often makes the resulting bounds too weak to be useful.\n  In this paper we prove a variant of the bounded differences inequality which\ncan be used to establish concentration of functions f(X) where (i) the typical\nchanges are small although (ii) the worst case changes might be very large. One\nkey aspect of this inequality is that it relies on a simple condition that (a)\nis easy to check and (b) coincides with heuristic considerations why\nconcentration should hold. Indeed, given an event \\Gamma that holds with very\nhigh probability, we essentially relax the Lipschitz condition (L) to\nsituations where \\Gamma occurs. The point is that the resulting typical changes\nc_k are often much smaller than the worst case ones.\n  To illustrate its application we consider the reverse H-free process, where H\nis 2-balanced. We prove that the final number of edges in this process is\nconcentrated, and also determine its likely value up to constant factors.

The difference between steganography and cryptography is\nthat steganography is a stealthy method of communication that only the\ncommunicating parties are aware of; while, cryptography is an overt method of\ncommunication that anyone is aware of, despite its payload is scribbled.\nTypically, an irrecoverable steganography algorithm is the algorithm that makes\nit hard for malicious third parties to discover how it works and how to recover\nthe secret data out of the carrier file. One popular way to achieve\nirrecoverability is to digitally process the carrier file after hiding the\nsecret data into it. However, such process is irreversible as it would destroy\nthe concealed data. This paper proposes a new image steganography method for\ntextual data, as well as for any form of digital data, based on adjusting the\nbrightness of the carrier image after covering the secret data into it. The\nalgorithm used is parameterized as it can be configured using three different\nparameters defined by the communicating parties. They include the amount of\nbrightness to apply on the carrier image after the completion of the covering\nprocess, the color channels whose brightness should be adjusted, and the bytes\nthat should carry in the secret data. The novelty of the proposed method is\nthat it embeds bits of the secret data into the three LSBs of the bytes that\ncompose the carrier image in such a way that does not destroy the secret data\nwhen restoring back the original brightness of the carrier image. The\nsimulation conducted proved that the proposed algorithm is valid and correct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 14:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

Several methods are extendedly\nproposed for the (1+1)-dimensional NLD equation with the scalar and vector\nself-interaction and analyzed in the way of the accuracy and the time\nreversibility as well as the conservation of the discrete charge, energy and\nlinear momentum. Those methods are the Crank-Nicolson (CN) schemes, the\nlinearized CN schemes, the odd-even hopscotch scheme, the leapfrog scheme, a\nsemi-implicit finite difference scheme, and the exponential operator splitting\n(OS) schemes. The nonlinear subproblems resulted from the OS schemes are\nanalytically solved by fully exploiting the local conservation laws of the NLD\nequation. The effectiveness of the various numerical methods, with special\nfocus on the error growth and the computational cost, is illustrated on two\nnumerical experiments, compared to two high-order accurate Runge-Kutta\ndiscontinuous Galerkin methods. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that\nthe high-order accurate OS schemes may compete well with other numerical\nschemes discussed here in terms of the accuracy and the efficiency. A\nfourth-order accurate OS scheme is further applied to investigating the\ninteraction dynamics of the NLD solitary waves under the scalar and vector\nself-interaction. The results show that the interaction dynamics of two NLD\nsolitary waves depend on the exponent power of the self-interaction in the NLD\nequation; collapse happens after collision of two equal one-humped NLD solitary\nwaves under the cubic vector self-interaction in contrast to no collapse\nscattering for corresponding quadric case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 15:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2013 12:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-03"}

Unlike cryptography which may arouse\nsuspicions, steganography is a stealthy method that enables data communication\nin total secrecy. Steganography has many requirements, the foremost one is\nirrecoverability which refers to how hard it is for someone apart from the\noriginal communicating parties to detect and recover the hidden data out of the\nsecret communication. A good strategy to guaranteeirrecoverability is to cover\nthe secret data not usinga trivial method based on a predictable algorithm, but\nusing a specific random pattern based on a mathematical algorithm. This paper\nproposes an image steganography technique based on theCanny edge detection\nalgorithm.It is designed to hide secret data into a digital image within the\npixels that make up the boundaries of objects detected in the image. More\nspecifically, bits of the secret data replace the three LSBs of every color\nchannel of the pixels detected by the Canny edge detection algorithm as part of\nthe edges in the carrier image. Besides, the algorithm is parameterized by\nthree parameters: The size of the Gaussian filter, a low threshold value, and a\nhigh threshold value. These parameters can yield to different outputs for the\nsame input image and secret data. As a result, discovering the inner-workings\nof the algorithm would be considerably ambiguous, misguiding steganalysts from\nthe exact location of the covert data. Experiments showed a simulation tool\ncodenamed GhostBit, meant to cover and uncover secret data using the proposed\nalgorithm. As future work, examining how other image processing techniques such\nas brightness and contrast adjustment can be taken advantage of in\nsteganography with the purpose ofgiving the communicating parties more\npreferences tomanipulate their secret communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 14:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}
