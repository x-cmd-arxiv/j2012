The first approach is an analytical one, based on\nthe assumption that the noise in the system is position independent. When\ncompared with the traditional approach, which requires constant deceleration,\nfor a typical system, we show an improvement of $\\sim$ 10% in the maximal\ncapture velocity, allowing for a larger slower acceptance, or a reduction of\n$sim$ 25% in slower length, allowing for a simpler design and a better\ncollimated beam. The second approach relies on an optimization of a system in\nwhich the magnetic field and the noise profile are well known. As an example,\nwe use our 12-coil modular design and show an improvement of $sim$ 9% in\nmaximal capture velocity or, alternatively, a reduction of $\\sim$ 33% in slower\nlength as compared with the traditional approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 16:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2013 15:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-25"}

We explicitly calculate\nand analyze the one-loop FRG equations in the zero-viscosity limit as a\nfunction of the dimension. For Burgers they reproduce the FRG equation obtained\nin the context of random manifolds, extending previous results of one of us.\nBreakdown of energy conservation due to shocks and the appearance of a direct\nenergy cascade corresponds to failure of dimensional reduction in the context\nof disordered systems.

Affine policies consist of a nominal power schedule plus a\nseries of planned linear modifications that depend on the prediction errors\nthat will become known at future times.

In the model, a single non-standard model like Higgs production\nof weak gauge boson fusion is suppressed due to the smallness of the vacuum\nexpectation value. In contrast to the single Higgs production, the cross\nsection of the Higgs pair production due to gauge boson fusion is not\nsuppressed.

However, many existing techniques commonly approach\nthese goals by seeking to recover preference (e.g., estimating ratings) in a\nmatrix completion framework. This paper aims to bridge this significant gap\nbetween the clearly-defined strategic objectives and the not-so-well-justified\nproxy.\n  We show it is advantageous to think of a recommender system as an analogy to\na monopoly economic market with the system as the sole seller, users as the\nbuyers and items as the goods. This new perspective motivates a game-theoretic\nformulation for recommendation that enables us to identify the optimal\nrecommendation policy by explicit optimizing certain strategic goals. In this\npaper, we revisit and extend our prior work, the Collaborative-Competitive\nFiltering preference model, towards a game-theoretic framework. The proposed\nframework consists of two components. First, a conditional preference model\nthat characterizes how a user would respond to a recommendation action; Second,\nknowing in advance how the user would respond, how a recommender system should\nact (i.e., recommend) strategically to maximize its goals. We show how\nobjectives such as click-through rate, sales revenue and consumption diversity\ncan be optimized explicitly in this framework.

According to the currently planned survey strategy and based on the\nparameters of the Galactic and extragalactic X-ray background as well as on the\nresults of the recent calculations of the eROSITA instrumental background, we\ncomputed a sensitivity map of the eRASS. Using the best available\nredshift-dependent AGN X-ray luminosity function (XLF), we computed various\ncharacteristics of the eRASS AGN sample, such as their luminosity- and redshift\ndistributions, and the brightness distributions of their optical counterparts.\n  Results. After four years of the survey, a sky-average sensitivity of\n~1x10^(-14) erg/s/cm^2 will be achieved in the 0.5-2.0keV band. With this\nsensitivity, eROSITA is expected to detect ~3 million AGN on the extragalactic\nsky (|b|>10deg).

In this non-relativistic\nlimit, baryons are composed of N_c quarks that interact, at leading order in\nN_c, through a color Coulomb potential. Using variational techniques, very\naccurate calculations of single baryon masses and interaction energies of\nlow-density baryon crystal are performed. These results are used to cross-check\na general numerical approach applicable for arbitrary quark masses and baryon\ndensities recently proposed by Bringoltz, which is based on a lattice in a\nfinite box with periodic boundary conditions. The Bringoltz method differs from\na previous approach of Salcedo, et al. in its treatment of a finite box effect\n- namely gauge configurations that wind around the box. One might expect these\neffects to be small for large enough boxes, in which the baryon density\napproaches zero to high accuracy at the edges. However, the effects of these\nwindings appear to be quite large even in such boxes. The large mass infinite\nvolume calculations performed here are consistent with the results of numerical\ncalculations using the Bringoltz method. The calculation of the baryon crystal\ninteraction energy requires the assumption that at low-densities the ground\nstate is composed of individual baryons, each in a color-singlet state and\northogonal to each other. This assumption is plausible but ad hoc in that one\ncan construct configurations in which the entire state is color-singlet but\ncannot be broken into individual color-singlet baryons. The interaction energy\nof low-density baryon crystals calculated with the assumption is consistent\nwith numerical results based on Bringoltz's approach suggesting that the\nassumption is justified. This further supports a similar assumption that was\nmade in 3+1 dimensions, where no alternative means of calculation exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 18:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}

Specifically we study the dependence on the magnetic flux\ndensity of three parameters describing the shape of two magnetically sensitive\nFeI lines, at 630.2 nm and 617.3 nm, namely the line core intensity (IC), full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM), and the equivalent width (EQW). To this aim we\nanalyze observations of active region NOAA 11172, acquired with IBIS at the\nDunn Solar Telescope, as well as results from numerical synthesis. Our results\nshow that IC is sensitive to both temperature and magnetic flux density\nvariations, FWHM is mostly affected by magnetic field changes, and EQW is\nmostly sensitive to temperature. Variations of a few percent of the measured\nline parameters are found in observational data that was spatially degraded to\nrepresent quiet-Sun, disk-centre, medium resolution observations. It is\ntherefore possible to disentangle magnetic from pure thermodynamic effects by\ncomparison of temporal variations of the EQW and the FWHM of either the two FeI\nlines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 20:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

SNe Iax are spectroscopically\nsimilar to SNe Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 < |v| < 8000\nkm/s), typically lower peak magnitudes (-14.2 > M_V,peak > -18.9 mag), and most\nhave hot photospheres. Relative to SNe Ia, SNe Iax have low luminosities for\ntheir light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and\nlight-curve shape, similar to that of SNe Ia, but offset from that of SNe Ia\nand with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is\nhighly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe Iax discovered in\nelliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars\nare white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra,\nlow ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray\ndetections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN\nsites.

Consistent with recent measurements of the CFIRB power\nspectrum in Herschel-SPIRE maps, we confirm the existence of a clear one-halo\nterm of galaxy clustering on arcminute angular scales with large-scale two-halo\nterm of clustering at 30 arcminutes to angular scales of a few degrees. The\npower spectrum at the largest angular scales, especially at 250 \\mu m, is\ncontaminated by the Galactic cirrus. The angular power spectrum is modeled\nusing a conditional luminosity function approach to describe the spatial\ndistribution of unresolved galaxies that make up the bulk of the CFIRB.\nIntegrating over the dusty galaxy population responsible for the background\nanisotropies, we find that the cosmic abundance of dust, relative to the\ncritical density, to be between \\Omega_dust=10^{-6} and 8 x 10^{-6} in the\nredshift range z ~ 0-3.

It can be\nmany times larger than the Newtonian force and their ratio is in principle\nunbound. This is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth force\nis no more than 1/3 of gravity. The evolution of voids is governed by the\nNewtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force.

Modeling this empirical relation from\nfirst principles proves challenging, however, and many questions regarding its\nproperties remain open. For instance, the exact functional form of the relation\nis still debated and it is also unknown whether it applies at z>4, where CO\nobservations are sparse. Here, we analyze how the shape of the star formation\n-- gas relation affects the cosmic star formation history and global galaxy\nproperties using an analytic model that follows the average evolution of\ngalaxies in dark matter halos across cosmic time. We show that a linear\nrelation with an H2 depletion time of ~2.5 Gyr, as found in studies of nearby\ngalaxies, results in good agreement with current observations of galaxies at\nboth low and high redshift. These observations include the evolution of the\ncosmic star formation rate density, the z~4-9 UV luminosity function, the\nevolution of the mass -- metallicity relation, the relation between stellar and\nhalo mass, and the gas-to-stellar mass ratios of galaxies. In contrast, the\nshort depletion times that result from adopting a highly super-linear star\nformation -- gas relation lead to large star formation rates, substantial metal\nenrichment (~0.1 solar), and low gas-to-stellar mass ratios already at z~10, in\ndisagreement with observations. These results can be understood in terms of an\nequilibrium picture of galaxy evolution in which gas inflows, outflows, and\nstar formation drive the metallicities and gas fractions toward equilibrium\nvalues that are determined by the ratio of the accretion time to the gas\ndepletion time. In this picture, the cosmic modulation of the accretion rate is\nthe primary process that drives the evolution of stellar masses, gas masses,\nand metallicities of galaxies from high redshift until today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 21:12:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 20:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In practical circumstances where experiments\nare time-consuming or resource-intensive, OED can yield enormous savings. We\npursue OED for nonlinear systems from a Bayesian perspective, with the goal of\nchoosing experiments that are optimal for parameter inference. Our objective in\nthis context is the expected information gain in model parameters, which in\ngeneral can only be estimated using Monte Carlo methods. Maximizing this\nobjective thus becomes a stochastic optimization problem.\n  This paper develops gradient-based stochastic optimization methods for the\ndesign of experiments on a continuous parameter space. Given a Monte Carlo\nestimator of expected information gain, we use infinitesimal perturbation\nanalysis to derive gradients of this estimator. We are then able to formulate\ntwo gradient-based stochastic optimization approaches: (i) Robbins-Monro\nstochastic approximation, and (ii) sample average approximation combined with a\ndeterministic quasi-Newton method. A polynomial chaos approximation of the\nforward model accelerates objective and gradient evaluations in both cases.

The kinetics can be\nrepresented by population rate equations based on a mean field assumption,\naccording to which the rate of aggregation is taken to be proportional to the\nproduct of the mean populations of the two participants. This can be a poor\napproximation when the mean populations are small. However, using the Poisson\nrepresentation it is possible to derive a set of rate equations that go beyond\nmean field theory, describing pseudo-populations that are continuous, noisy and\ncomplex, but where averaging over the noise and initial conditions gives the\nmean of the physical population. Such an approach is explored for the simple\ncase of a size-independent rate of coagulation between particles. Analytical\nresults are compared with numerical computations and with results derived by\nother means. In the numerical work we encounter instabilities that can be\neliminated using a suitable 'gauge' transformation of the problem [P. D.\nDrummond, Eur. Phys. J.

The contributions of the remaining hadronic weak\nHamiltonian respect a similar hierarchy. We employ a resonance model to\npreclude (in the \\bar B -> \\bar K^* case) large long-distance corrections to\nthis.\n  A phenomenological part pays particular attention to the region of lowest\ndilepton mass, 4 m_l^2 <= q^2 <= 2 GeV^2.

Despite using a universal local law to form stars in the\nsimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spirals\non the large-scale Kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times less\nefficiently. This offset is in agreement with previous results on morphological\nquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded in\nearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. As\na result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach as\nhigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. Even if some molecular gas is\npresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantly\nreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. We also\nanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their CO\nand HI surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by their\nnon-stellar 8um emission. As predicted by the simulations, we find that the\nearly-type galaxies are offset from the Kennicutt relation compared to the\nspirals, with a twice lower efficiency. Finally, we validate our approach by\nperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. We run a\nsimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of NGC524, a\nlenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation rate\nin good agreement with the observations. Morphological quenching thus seems to\nbe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of a\nreduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the COLD GASS\nsurvey. This lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain the\nformation of the whole Red Sequence, but can contribute to the reddening of\nsome galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 03:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It works by injecting random\nnoise into each query result, such that it is provably hard for the adversary\nto infer the presence or absence of any individual record from the published\nnoisy results. The main objective in differentially private query processing is\nto maximize the accuracy of the query results, while satisfying the privacy\nguarantees. Previous work, notably \\cite{LHR+10}, has suggested that with an\nappropriate strategy, processing a batch of correlated queries as a whole\nachieves considerably higher accuracy than answering them individually.\nHowever, to our knowledge there is currently no practical solution to find such\na strategy for an arbitrary query batch; existing methods either return\nstrategies of poor quality (often worse than naive methods) or require\nprohibitively expensive computations for even moderately large domains.\n  Motivated by this, we propose the \\emph{Low-Rank Mechanism} (LRM), the first\npractical differentially private technique for answering batch queries with\nhigh accuracy, based on a \\emph{low rank approximation} of the workload matrix.\nWe prove that the accuracy provided by LRM is close to the theoretical lower\nbound for any mechanism to answer a batch of queries under differential\nprivacy.

The paper analyzes this\nframework, by focusing in particular on \"minimal\" tree projections, that is, on\ntree projections without useless redundancies. First, it is shown that minimal\ntree projections enjoy a number of properties that are usually required for\nnormal form decompositions in various structural decomposition methods. In\nparticular, they enjoy the same kind of connection properties as (minimal) tree\ndecompositions of graphs, with the result being tight in the light of the\nnegative answer that is provided to the open question about whether they enjoy\na slightly stronger notion of connection property, defined to speed-up the\ncomputation of hypertree decompositions.

In this game, as for the Robber and Cops game\ncharacterizing tree decompositions, the existence of winning strategies implies\nthe existence of monotone ones. As a special case, the Captain and Robber game\ncan be used to characterize the generalized hypertree decomposition method,\nwhere such a game-theoretic characterization was missing and asked for.

A little explored question is how this evolution would be\nmodified if the initial disc was assembled around a preexisting classical\nbulge. Previously we showed that a low-mass initial classical bulge (ICB), as\nmight have been present in Milky Way-like galaxies, can spin up significantly\nby gaining angular momentum from a bar formed through disc instability. Here we\ninvestigate how the disc instability and the kinematics of the final\nboxy/peanut (BP) bulge depend on the angular momentum of such a low-mass ICB.\nWe show that a strong bar forms and transfers angular momentum to the ICB in\nall our models. However, rotation in the ICB limits the emission of the bar's\nangular momentum, which in turn changes the size and growth of the bar, and of\nthe BP bulge formed from the disc.\n  The final BP bulge in these models is a superposition of the BP bulge formed\nvia the buckling instability and the spun-up ICB. We find that the long-term\nkinematics of the composite BP bulges in our simulations is independent of the\nrotation of the ICB, and is always described by cylindrical rotation. However,\nas a result of the co-evolution between bulge and bar, deviations from\ncylindrical rotation are seen during the early phases of secular evolution, and\nmay correspond to similar deviations observed in some bulges.

An original vibro-acoustical method is\npresented to isolate the soundboard nonlinearity from that of the exciting\ndevice (here: a loudspeaker) and to measure it. The nonlinear part of the\nsoundboard response to an external excitation is quantitatively estimated for\nthe first time, at \\approx -40 dB below the linear part at the ff nuance. Given\nthis essentially linear response, a modal identification is performed up to 3\nkHz by means of a novel high resolution modal analysis technique (Ege et al.,\nHigh-resolution modal analysis, JSV, 325(4-5), 2009). Modal dampings (which, so\nfar, were unknown for the piano in this frequency range) are determined in the\nmidfrequency domain where FFT-based methods fail to evaluate them with an\nacceptable precision.

The frequency-dependency\nof the modal density and the observation of modal shapes reveal two\nwell-separated regimes.

It is well known that DA is an hard task even under strong\nassumptions, among which the covariate-shift where the source and target\ndistributions diverge only in their marginals, i.e. they have the same labeling\nfunction. Another popular approach is to consider an hypothesis class that\nmoves closer the two distributions while implying a low-error for both tasks.\nThis is a VC-dim approach that restricts the complexity of an hypothesis class\nin order to get good generalization. Instead, we propose a PAC-Bayesian\napproach that seeks for suitable weights to be given to each hypothesis in\norder to build a majority vote. We prove a new DA bound in the PAC-Bayesian\ncontext. This leads us to design the first DA-PAC-Bayesian algorithm based on\nthe minimization of the proposed bound. Doing so, we seek for a \\rho-weighted\nmajority vote that takes into account a trade-off between three quantities. The\nfirst two quantities being, as usual in the PAC-Bayesian approach, (a) the\ncomplexity of the majority vote (measured by a Kullback-Leibler divergence) and\n(b) its empirical risk (measured by the \\rho-average errors on the source\nsample). The third quantity is (c) the capacity of the majority vote to\ndistinguish some structural difference between the source and target samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 09:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}

This expansion shifts the d-wave superconductivity away\nfrom the half filled point reducing its occupation range approximately to the\nexperimental range in the YBaCuO compound. The CP approximation used for the\nCoulomb repulsion is justified by the large ratio of Coulomb repulsion to the\neffective width of perturbed density of states being reduced by the hopping\ninteraction. Fast disappearance of antiferromagnetism observed experimentally\nis supported by the relatively large value of the total width of unperturbed\ndensity of states.

Previous attempts to estimate\nthis travel time have assumed that the probe's motion is simple, moving at a\nconstant maximum velocity, with powered flight producing the necessary change\nin velocity required at each star to complete its chosen trajectory. This\napproach ignores lessons learned from interplanetary exploration, where orbital\nslingshot maneouvres can provide significant velocity boosts at little to no\nfuel cost. It is plausible that any attempt to explore the Galaxy would utilise\nsuch economising techniques, despite there being an upper limit to these\nvelocity boosts, related to the escape velocity of the object being used to\nprovide the slingshot.\n  In order to investigate the effects of these techniques, we present multiple\nrealisations of single probes exploring a small patch of the Milky Way. We\ninvestigate 3 separate scenarios, studying the slingshot effect on trajectories\ndefined by simple heuristics. These scenarios are: i) standard powered flight\nto the nearest unvisited star without using slingshot techniques; ii) flight to\nthe nearest unvisited star using slingshot techniques, and iii) flight to the\nnext unvisited star which provides the maximal velocity boost under a slingshot\ntrajectory.\n  We find that adding slingshot velocity boosts can decrease the travel time by\nup to two orders of magnitude over simple powered flight. In the third case,\nselecting a route which maximises velocity boosts also reduces the travel time\nrelative to powered flight, but by a much reduced factor.

Finally, a\nnon-linear optimization problem, which includes physical constraints at the\ncontact point level, is proposed and solved in order to find the limit\n(maximum) internal friction angle in terms of the aforementioned\nmicro-parameters. Thus, throughout this theoretical study, some important\nfeatures about strength, anisotropy, contact buckling, and non-uniqueness of\nsystems of contact forces are extracted, allowing us to have a deeper insight,\nas well as, a better understanding of the mechanical behavior of such\ncomplex-to-model materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 10:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2013 20:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-06"}

The non-thermal radiation is due to synchrotron emission in the\ncolliding-wind region. Cyg OB2 #9 was only recently discovered to be a binary\nsystem and a multi-wavelength campaign was organized to study its 2011\nperiastron passage. We report here on the results of the radio observations\nobtained in this monitoring campaign. We used the Expanded Very Large Array\n(EVLA) radio interferometer to obtain 6 and 20 cm continuum fluxes. The\nobserved radio light curve shows a steep drop in flux sometime before\nperiastron. The fluxes drop to a level that is comparable to the expected\nfree-free emission from the stellar winds, suggesting that the non-thermal\nemitting region is completely hidden at that time. After periastron passage,\nthe fluxes slowly increase. We introduce a simple model to solve the radiative\ntransfer in the stellar winds and the colliding-wind region, and thus determine\nthe expected behaviour of the radio light curve. From the asymmetry of the\nlight curve, we show that the primary has the stronger wind. This is somewhat\nunexpected if we use the astrophysical parameters based on theoretical\ncalibrations. But it becomes entirely feasible if we take into account that a\ngiven spectral type - luminosity class combination covers a range of\nastrophysical parameters. The colliding-wind region also contributes to the\nfree-free emission, which can help to explain the high values of the spectral\nindex seen after periastron passage. Combining our data with older Very Large\nArray (VLA) data allows us to derive a period P = 860.0 +- 3.7 days for this\nsystem. With this period, we update the orbital parameters that were derived in\nthe first paper of this series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 10:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

The latter is combined to known normalization methods to\nachieve a significant hybrid normalization approach. Finally, an intensive and\ncomparative study approves the efficiency of these enhancements and shows\nbetter performance comparing to other proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 13:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}

For the narrower lined stars, metal and non-diffuse helium\nlines were adopted, and for the broader lined stars, both non-diffuse and\ndiffuse helium lines; the estimates obtained using the different sets of lines\nare in good agreement.

Its immense\nvariety of applications was in recent years complemented by interesting\nnanotechnological applications. The fabrication of complex cellulose-based\nmaterials asks for thorough understanding of the surface structure and its\ninteractions with adsorbates. In this study we investigate several surface\nmodel systems of nanotechnological interest, which are obtained by\nreorganization of the cellulose-vacuum or cellulose-water interfaces of slabs\nof crystalline cellulose. To do this, we constructed supercells from\ncrystallographic data, and then optimized the interface structures. From the\nbulk and surface systems we calculated structural properties such as unit cell\nparameters, dihedral conformation distributions, density profiles and hydrogen\nbonding. The results suggest that no overall geometrical restructuring occurs\nat the interface. However, the hydrogen bond network is strongly reconstructed,\nas is inferred from the dihedral conformations and hydrogen bond occurrences,\nalthough only within the first few layers. This holds for low index close\npacked structures as well as for high index loosely packed surfaces. Replacing\nthe vacuum by ambient pressure water molecules we find less rearrangements of\nthe cellulose surface, because the water allows formation of hydrogen bonds\nsimilar to those in the bulk phase. The water near the cellulose surface shows,\nhowever, strong structural changes. We observe reduced mobility of the water\nmolecules, which corresponds to a cooling of water by about 30 degrees, in a\nslab that is about 10 \\AA\\ thick. Although structuring and adsorption is\nobserved on all surfaces, no actual penetration of water into the cellulose\nstructure could be observed. This suggests that pure water is not sufficient to\nproduce cellulose swelling at mesoscopic timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 13:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

However, some\nself-directed lymphocytes may evade selection and still be harmless due to a\nmechanism called clonal anergy. As for B lymphocytes, two major explanations\nfor anergy developed over three decades: according to \"Varela theory\", it stems\nfrom a proper orchestration of the whole B-repertoire, in such a way that\nself-reactive clones, due to intensive interactions and feed-back from other\nclones, display more inertia to mount a response. On the other hand, according\nto the `two-signal model\", which has prevailed nowadays, self-reacting cells\nare not stimulated by helper lymphocytes and the absence of such signaling\nyields anergy. The first result we present, achieved through disordered\nstatistical mechanics, shows that helper cells do not prompt the activation and\nproliferation of a certain sub-group of B cells, which turn out to be just\nthose broadly interacting, hence it merges the two approaches as a whole (in\nparticular, Varela theory is then contained into the two-signal model). As a\nsecond result, we outline a minimal topological architecture for the B-world,\nwhere highly connected clones are self-directed as a natural consequence of an\nontogenetic learning; this provides a mathematical framework to Varela\nperspective. As a consequence of these two achievements, clonal deletion and\nclonal anergy can be seen as two inter-playing aspects of the same phenomenon\ntoo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 19:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}
