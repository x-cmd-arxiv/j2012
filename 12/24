The theory predicts the existence of a\nlong-range scalar field, which passes the Solar System observational\nconstraints, even if the scalar field is very light, and modifies the\ncosmological and galactic dynamics. Thus, the theory opens new possibilities to\napproach, in the same theoretical framework, the problems of both dark energy\nand dark matter. In this work, we consider the generalized virial theorem in\nthe scalar-tensor representation of the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. More\nspecifically, taking into account the relativistic collisionless Boltzmann\nequation, we show that the supplementary geometric terms in the gravitational\nfield equations provide an effective contribution to the gravitational\npotential energy. We show that the total virial mass is proportional to the\neffective mass associated with the new terms generated by the effective scalar\nfield, and the baryonic mass. This shows that the geometric origin in the\ngeneralized virial theorem may account for the well-known virial theorem mass\ndiscrepancy in clusters of galaxies. In addition to this, we also consider\nastrophysical applications of the model and show that the model predicts that\nthe mass associated to the scalar field and its effects extend beyond the\nvirial radius of the clusters of galaxies. In the context of the galaxy cluster\nvelocity dispersion profiles predicted by the hybrid metric-Palatini model, the\ngeneralized virial theorem can be an efficient tool in observationally testing\nthe viability of this class of generalized gravity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 17:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2013 15:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-18"}

Thus, the benefit of this method is that MUBs need to be\ndefined for the small Hilbert spaces of the subsystems rather than for the\nlarge space of the overall system.

Two apparent \"superhumps\" dominate\nthe nightly light curves - with periods 4.6% longer, and 3.0% shorter, than\nP_orb. The first appears to be associated with the star's brighter states\n(V~14), while the second appears to be present throughout and becomes very\ndominant in the low state (V~15.7).\n  Starting in the year 2005, the star's light curve became indistinguishable\nfrom that of a dwarf nova - in particular, that of the ER UMa subclass.\nReviewing all the star's oddities, we speculate: (a) BK Lyn is the remnant of\nthe probable nova on 30 December 101, and (b) it has been fading ever since,\nbut has taken ~2000 years for the accretion rate to drop sufficiently to permit\ndwarf-nova eruptions. If such behavior is common, it can explain other puzzles\nof CV evolution. One: why the ER UMa class even exists (because all members can\nbe remnants of recent novae). Two: why ER UMa stars and short-period novalikes\nare rare (because their lifetimes, which are essentially cooling times, are\nshort). Three: why short-period novae all decline to luminosity states far\nabove their true quiescence (because they're just getting started in their\npostnova cooling). Four: why the orbital periods, accretion rates, and\nwhite-dwarf temperatures of short-period CVs are somewhat too large to arise\npurely from the effects of gravitational radiation (because the unexpectedly\nlong interval of enhanced postnova brightness boosts the mean mass-transfer\nrate). These are substantial rewards in return for one investment of\nhypothesis: that the second parameter in CV evolution, besides P_orb, is time\nsince the last classical-nova eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 21:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Based on this model,\nthe microscopic quantum structure of Schwarzschild black hole and quantum\nstatistical origin of its gravity are studied. The cutoff of black hole horizon\nleads to Casimir effect inside the horizon. This effect makes the inside vacuum\nhas less zero quantum fluctuation energy than that of outside vacuum and the\nspin 1/2 radiation hole excitations are resulted inside the horizon. The mean\nenergy of the radiation hole excitations is related to the temperature decrease\nof the Hawking-Unruh type by the period law of the Fermion temperature greens\nfunction and a temperature difference as well as gravity are created on the\nhorizon. A dual relation of the gravity potentials between inside and outside\nregions of the black hole is found. An attractor behaviour of the horizon\nsurface is unveiled. The gravity potential inside the black hole is linear in\nradial coordinate and no singularity exists at the origin of the black hole, in\ncontrast to the conventional conjecture. All the particles absorbed by the\nblack hole have fallen down to the horizon and converted into spin 1/2\nradiation quanta with the mean energy related to the Hawking-Unruh temperature,\nthe thermodynamic equilibrium and the mechanical balance make the radiation\nquanta be tightly bound in the horizon. The gravitation mass $2M$ and physical\nmass $M$ of the black hole are calculated. The calculated entropy of the black\nhole is well consistent with Hawking. Outside the horizon, there exist\nthermodynamic non-equilibrium and mechanical non-balance which lead to an\noutward centrifugal energy flow and an inward gravitation energy flow.

In this framework, it is proposed to bias the importance function\nusing the lowest Jacobian eigenvalue moduli along the dynamical trajectory. A\nlowest eigenvalue modulus is related to the lowest eigenvalue of the Hessian\nmatrix and is evaluated here using the Lanczos algorithm as in\nactivation-relaxation techniques. This results in favoring the sampling of\nactivated trajectories and enhancing the occurrence of the rare reactive\ntrajectories of interest, those corresponding to transitions between locally\nstable states. Estimating the time-correlation functions involves unbiasing the\nsample of simulated trajectories which is done using the multi-state Bennett\nacceptance ratio (MBAR) method. To assess the performance of our procedure, we\ncompute the time-correlation function associated with the migration of a\nvacancy in {\\alpha}-iron. The derivative of the estimated time-correlation\nfunction yields a migration rate in agreement with the one given by transition\nstate theory. Besides, we show that the information relative to rejected\ntrajectories can be recycled within MBAR, resulting in a substantial speed-up.\nUnlike original transition path-sampling, our approach does not require\ncomputing the reversible work to confine the trajectory endpoints to a reactive\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2012 10:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In recent years, the Magic Set method\nhas received some interest in this setting, and a variant of it, called DMS,\nhas been proposed for ASP. However, this technique has a caveat, because it is\nnot correct (in the sense of being query-equivalent) for all ASP programs. In\nrecent work, a large fragment of ASP programs, referred to as super-coherent\nprograms, has been identified, for which DMS is correct. The fragment contains\nall programs which possess at least one answer set, no matter which set of\nfacts is added to them. Two open question remained: How complex is it to\ndetermine whether a given program is super-coherent? Does the restriction to\nsuper-coherent programs limit the problems that can be solved? Especially the\nfirst question turned out to be quite difficult to answer precisely. In this\npaper, we formally prove that deciding whether a propositional program is\nsuper-coherent is \\Pi^P_3-complete in the disjunctive case, while it is\n\\Pi^P_2-complete for normal programs.

Here we\ninvestigate the deviation of the non-linear field configuration from that of\nthe linear and potential configurations, and study the free energy available\nleading up to and after a flare. The evolution of the magnetic field in NOAA\nregion 10953 was examined using data from Hinode/SOT-SP, over a period of 12\nhours leading up to and after a GOES B1.0 flare. Previous work on this region\nfound pre- and post-flare changes in photospheric vector magnetic field\nparameters of flux elements outside the primary sunspot. 3D geometry was thus\ninvestigated using potential, linear force-free, and non-linear force-free\nfield extrapolations in order to fully understand the evolution of the field\nlines. Traced field line geometrical and footpoint orientation differences show\nthat the field does not completely relax to a fully potential or linear\nforce-free state after the flare. Magnetic and free magnetic energies increase\nsignificantly ~ 6.5-2.5 hours before the flare by ~ 10^31 erg. After the flare,\nthe non-linear force-free magnetic energy and free magnetic energies decrease\nbut do not return to pre-flare 'quiet' values. The post-flare non-linear\nforce-free field configuration is closer (but not equal) to that of the linear\nforce-free field configuration than a potential one.

This perverse sheaf lifts to a mixed Hodge module\nand gives us a cohomology theory which enables us to define the Gopakumar-Vafa\ninvariants mathematically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2012 22:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 19:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 19:33:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 07:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}
