The present model enables us to clearly demonstrate that\nat chemical freeze-out the resulting hadronic mass spectrum used in the hadron\nresonance gas model is not an exponential-like, but a power-like. We argue that\nsuch a property of hadronic mass spectrum at chemical freeze-out can be\nexplained by the two new effects found here for wide resonances existing in a\nthermal environment: the near threshold thermal resonance enhancement and the\nnear threshold resonance sharpening. The effect of resonance sharpening is\nstudied for a sigma meson and our analysis shows that for the temperatures well\nbelow 92 MeV the effective width of sigma meson is about 50 to 70 MeV. Thus,\nthe effect of resonance sharpening justifies the usage of the sigma-like\nfield-theoretical models for the strongly interacting matter equation of state\nat such temperatures. Also we argue that the most optimistic hope to find the\nquark gluon bags experimentally may be related to their sharpening and\nenhancement in a thermal medium. In this case the wide quark gluon bags may\nappear directly or in decays as narrow resonances that are absent in the tables\nof elementary particles and that have the width about 50-150 MeV and the mass\nabout or above 2.5 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 16:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-19"}

In contrast, the social identity approach posits\nthat an individual is likely to join a group based on an intrinsic\nself-evaluation at a cognitive or perceptual level.

Our approach hinges on the basic\nintuition that many networks contain noise in the link structure and that\ncontent information can help strengthen the community signal. This enables ones\nto eliminate the impact of noise (false positives and false negatives), which\nis particularly prevalent in online social networks and Web-scale information\nnetworks.\n  Specifically we introduce a measure of signal strength between two nodes in\nthe network by fusing their link strength with content similarity. Link\nstrength is estimated based on whether the link is likely (with high\nprobability) to reside within a community. Content similarity is estimated\nthrough cosine similarity or Jaccard coefficient. We discuss a simple mechanism\nfor fusing content and link similarity. We then present a biased edge sampling\nprocedure which retains edges that are locally relevant for each graph node.\nThe resulting backbone graph can be clustered using standard community\ndiscovery algorithms such as Metis and Markov clustering.\n  Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets (Flickr,\nWikipedia and CiteSeer) with varying sizes and characteristics, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our methods over state-of-the-art learning\nand mining approaches several of which also attempt to combine link and content\nanalysis for the purposes of community discovery. Specifically we always find a\nqualitative benefit when combining content with link analysis. Additionally our\nbiased graph sampling approach realizes a quantitative benefit in that it is\ntypically several orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 18:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

In this setting, called\nreverse mathematics, one investigates which theorems provably imply which\nothers in a weak formal theory roughly corresponding to computable mathematics.\nSince the proofs of such implications take place in classical logic, they may\nin principle involve appeals to multiple applications of a particular theorem,\nor to non-uniform decisions about how to proceed in a given construction. In\npractice, however, if a theorem $\\mathsf{Q}$ implies a theorem $\\mathsf{P}$, it\nis usually because there is a direct uniform translation of the problems\nrepresented by $\\mathsf{P}$ into the problems represented by $\\mathsf{Q}$, in a\nprecise sense. We study this notion of uniform reducibility in the context of\nseveral natural combinatorial problems, and compare and contrast it with the\ntraditional notion of implication in reverse mathematics. We show, for\ninstance, that for all $n,j,k \\geq 1$, if $j < k$ then Ramsey's theorem for\n$n$-tuples and $k$ many colors does not uniformly reduce to Ramsey's theorem\nfor $j$ many colors.

Sina Weibo\nand Twitter have a lot in common, however, in terms of the following\npreference, Sina Weibo users, most of whom are Chinese, behave differently\ncompared with those of Twitter.\n  This work is based on a data set of Sina Weibo which contains 80.8 million\nusers' profiles and 7.2 billion relations and a large data set of Twitter.\nFirstly some basic features of Sina Weibo and Twitter are analyzed such as\ndegree and activeness distribution, correlation between degree and activeness,\nand the degree of separation. Then the following preference is investigated by\nstudying the assortative mixing, friend similarities, following distribution,\nedge balance ratio, and ranking correlation, where edge balance ratio is newly\nproposed to measure balance property of graphs. It is found that Sina Weibo has\na lower reciprocity rate, more positive balanced relations and is more\ndisassortative. Coinciding with Asian traditional culture, the following\npreference of Sina Weibo users is more concentrated and hierarchical: they are\nmore likely to follow people at higher or the same social levels and less\nlikely to follow people lower than themselves. In contrast, the same kind of\nfollowing preference is weaker in Twitter. Twitter users are open as they\nfollow people from levels, which accords with its global characteristic and the\nprevalence of western civilization. The message forwarding behavior is studied\nby displaying the propagation levels, delays, and critical users. The following\npreference derives from not only the usage habits but also underlying reasons\nsuch as personalities and social moralities that is worthy of future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 23:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

This conclusion, however, disagrees with Point Contact Andreev\nReflection (PCAR) spectroscopy measurements, which give much lower values of\nspin polarization, P. Here, we present the spin polarization measurements of\nCo2FeSi by the PCAR technique, along with a thorough computational exploration,\nwithin the DFT and a GGA+U approach, of the Coulomb exchange U-parameters for\nCo and Fe atoms, taking into account spin-orbit coupling. We find that the\norbital contribution (mo) to the total magnetic moment (mT) is significant,\nsince it is at least 3 times greater than the experimental uncertainty of mT.\nAccount of mo radically affects the acceptable values of U. Specifically, we\nfind no values of U that would simultaneously satisfy the experimental values\nof the magnetic moment and result in the half-metallicity of Co2FeSi. On the\nother hand, the ranges of U that we report as acceptable are compatible with\nspin polarization measurements (ours and the ones found in the literature),\nwhich all are within approximately 40-60% range. Thus, based on reconciling\nexperimental and computational results, we conclude that: a) spin-orbit\ncoupling cannot be neglected in calculating Co2FeSi magnetic properties, and b)\nCo2FeSi Heusler alloy is not half-metallic. We believe that our approach can be\napplied to other Heusler alloys such as Co2FeAl.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Dec 2012 23:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-04"}

While technically feasible, the direct measurement of\npoint-to-point traffic imposes a heavy burden on network performance and is\ntypically not implemented. Instead, indirect aggregate traffic volumes are\nroutinely collected. We consider the problem of estimating point-to-point\ntraffic volumes, x_t, from aggregate traffic volumes, y_t, given information\nabout the network routing protocol encoded in a matrix A. This estimation task\ncan be reformulated as finding the solutions to a sequence of ill-posed linear\ninverse problems, y_t = A x_t, since the number of origin-destination routes of\ninterest is higher than the number of aggregate measurements available.\n  Here, we introduce a novel multilevel state-space model of aggregate traffic\nvolumes with realistic features. We implement a naive strategy for estimating\nunobserved point-to-point traffic volumes from indirect measurements of\naggregate traffic, based on particle filtering. We then develop a more\nefficient two-stage inference strategy that relies on model-based\nregularization: a simple model is used to calibrate regularization parameters\nthat lead to efficient and scalable inference in the multilevel state-space\nmodel. We apply our methods to corporate and academic networks, where we show\nthat the proposed inference strategy outperforms existing approaches and scales\nto larger networks.

Adapting strategies from classical\nsilicon based semiconductor technology, we use the incorporation of heteroatoms\nin the 2D graphene network as a straightforward way to achieve this goal. Here,\nwe report on the synthesis of boron-doped graphene on Ni(111) in a chemical\nvapor deposition process of triethylborane on the one hand and by segregation\nof boron from the bulk on the other hand. The chemical environment of boron was\ndetermined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and angle resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy was used to analyze the impact on the band structure. Doping with\nboron leads to a shift of the graphene bands to lower binding energies. The\nshift depends on the doping concentration and for a doping level of 0.3 ML a\nshift of up to 1.2 eV is observed. The experimental results are in agreement\nwith density-functional calculations. Furthermore, our calculations suggest\nthat doping with boron leads to graphene preferentially adsorbed in the top-fcc\ngeometry, since the boron atoms in the graphene lattice are then adsorbed at\nsubstrate fcc-hollow sites. The smaller adsorption distance of boron compared\nto carbon leads to a bending of the graphene sheet in the vicinity of the boron\natoms. By comparing calculations of doped and undoped graphene on Ni(111), as\nwell as the respective free-standing cases, we are able to distinguish between\nthe effects that doping and adsorption have on the band structure of graphene.\nBoth, doping and bonding to the surface, result in opposing shifts on the\ngraphene bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Dec 2012 14:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}

The goal of this paper is to monitor the same coronal\nstructures over a time interval of six days and resolve active regions on a\nstellar corona through rotational modulation. We report on four iso-phase X-ray\nspectroscopic observations of the RS CVn binary EI Eri with XMM-Newton, carried\nout approximately every two days, to match the rotation period of EI Eri. We\npresent an analysis of the thermal and chemical structure of the Ei Eri corona\nas it evolves over the six days.

An active region, predating the beginning of the campaign,\nrepeatedly enters into our view at the same phase as it rotates from beyond the\nstellar limb. As a result, the abundances tend slightly, but consistently, to\nincrease for high FIP elements (an inverse FIP effect) with phase. We estimate\nthe abundance increase of high FIP elements in the active region to be of ~75%\nover the coronal mean.
