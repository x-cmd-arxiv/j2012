This effect has been confirmed in studies focusing on\nlarge spatial scales, whereas the importance of local structure is not well\nunderstood. Slavemaking ants are social parasites that exploit workers of\nanother species to rear their offspring. Enslaved workers of the host species\nTemnothorax longispinosus have been found to exhibit an effective\npost-enslavement defence behaviour: enslaved workers were observed killing a\nlarge proportion of the parasites' offspring. Since enslaved workers do not\nreproduce, they gain no direct fitness benefit from this 'rebellion' behaviour.\nHowever, there may be an indirect benefit: neighbouring host nests that are\nrelated to 'rebel' nests can benefit from a reduced raiding pressure, as a\nresult of the reduction in parasite nest size due to the enslaved workers'\nkilling behaviour. We use a simple mathematical model to examine whether the\nsmall-scale population structure of the host species could explain the\nevolution of this potentially altruistic defence trait against slavemaking\nants. We find that this is the case if enslaved host workers are related to\nnearby host nests. In a population genetic study we confirm that enslaved\nworkers are, indeed, more closely related to host nests within the raiding\nrange of their resident slavemaker nest, than to host nests outside the raiding\nrange. This small-scale population structure seems to be a result of polydomy\n(e.g. the occupation of several nests in close proximity by a single colony)\nand could have enabled the evolution of 'rebellion' by kin selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 17:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 23:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

This procedure however,\nsuffers from two systematic errors when applied to particles that perform\nanomalous diffusion. The first is significant at short time lags and is induced\nby measurement errors. The second arises from the natural heterogeneity in\nbiophysical systems. We show how to estimate and correct these two errors and\nimprove the estimation of the anomalous parameters for the whole particle\ndistribution. As a consequence we manage to characterize ensembles of\nheterogeneous particles even for rather short and noisy measurements where\nregular time averaged mean square displacement analysis fails. We apply this\nmethod to both simulations and in vivo measurements of telomere diffusion in\n3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. The motion of telomeres is found to be\nsubdiffusive with an average exponent constant in time. Individual telomere\nexponents are normally distributed around the average exponent.

The presence of a duplicate removes the constraint of natural\nselection upon the gene, leading to its likely loss of function or,\noccasionally, the gain of a novel one. Alternately, a pleiotropic gene might\npartition its functions among its duplicates, thus preserving both copies.\nDuplicate genes is not a novelty for diploid genotypes, but only for\nhaplotypes. In this paper, we study the consequences of regulatory interactions\nin diploid genotypes and explore how the context of allelic interactions gives\nrise to dynamical phenotypes that enable duplicate genes to spread in a\npopulation. The regulatory network we study is that of a single autoregulatory\nactivator gene, and the two copies of the gene diverge either as alleles in a\ndiploid species or as duplicates in haploids. These differences are in their\ntranscriptional ability -- either via alterations to its activating domain, or\nto its cis-regulatory binding repertoire. When cis-regulatory changes are\nintroduced that partition multiple regulatory triggers among the duplicates, it\nis shown that mutually exclusive expression states of the duplicates that\nemerge are accompanied by a back-up facility: when a highly expressed gene is\ndeleted, the previously unexpressed duplicate copy compensates for it. The\ndiploid version of the regulatory network model can account for allele-specific\nexpression variants, and a model of inheritance of the haplotype network\nenables us to trace the evolutionary consequence of heterozygous phenotypes.\nThis is modelled for the variations in the activating domain of one copy,\nwhereby stable as well as transiently bursting oscillations ensue in single\ncells. The evolutionary model shows that these phenotypic states accessible to\na diploid, heterozygous genotype enable the spread of a duplicated haplotype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 17:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

In 2+1 dimensions, the quantum phases in the presence of a global\nsymmetry group SG, and with topological order described by a finite gauge group\nGG, are classified by the cohomology group H^3(SGxGG,U(1)). Generally in d+1\ndimensions, such quantum phases are classified by H^{d+1}(SGxGG,U(1)). Although\nwe only partially understand to what extent our classification is complete, we\npresent an exactly solvable local bosonic model, in which the topological order\nis emergent, for each given class in our classification.

Since the coupling between dark energy and dark matter affects in a\nparticular way the clustering properties of haloes and, specifically, the\namplitude and location of the baryonic acoustic oscillations, the cosmic\nevolution of the baryonic peak position might provide a direct way to\ndiscriminate interacting dark energy models from the standard \\Lambda CDM\nframework. To maximize the efficiency of the baryonic peak as a dynamic probe,\nthe correlation function has to be measured in redshift-space, where the\nbaryonic acoustic shift due to non-linearities is amplified. The typical\nredshift errors of spectroscopic galaxy surveys do not significantly impact\nthese results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-06"}

Both turbulent diffusion and advection by the\naccretion flow contribute to flux transport, and they are likely to act in\nopposition. We study the consequences of the vertical variation of the\ndiffusion coefficients, due to a varying strength of the turbulence. For this\npurpose, we consider three different vertical profiles of these coefficients.\nThe first one is aimed at mimicking the turbulent stress profile observed in\nnumerical simulations of MHD turbulence in stratified discs. This enables us to\nconfirm the robustness of the main result of Paper I obtained for uniform\ndiffusion coefficients that, for weak magnetic fields, the contribution of the\naccretion flow to the transport velocity of magnetic flux is much larger than\nthe transport velocity of mass. We then consider the presence of a dead zone\naround the equatorial plane, where the physical resistivity is high while the\nturbulent viscosity is low. We find that it amplifies the previous effect: weak\nmagnetic fields can be advected orders of magnitude faster than mass, for dead\nzones with a large vertical extension. The ratio of advection to diffusion,\ndetermining the maximum inclination of the field at the surface of the disc, is\nhowever not much affected. Finally, we study the effect of a non-turbulent\nlayer at the surface of the disc, which has been suggested as a way to reduce\nthe diffusion of the magnetic flux. We find that the reduction of the diffusion\nrequires the conducting layer to extend below the height at which the magnetic\npressure equals the thermal pressure. As a consequence, if the absence of\nturbulence is caused by the large-scale magnetic field, the highly conducting\nlayer is inefficient at reducing the diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In this framework,\nscaling relations between observables (such as that between X-ray luminosity\nand temperature) are modelled explicitly in terms of the fundamental\nmass-observable scaling relations, and so are fully constrained without being\nfit directly. We apply the PICACS model to two observational datasets, and show\nthat it performs as well as traditional regression methods for simply measuring\nindividual scaling relation parameters, but reveals additional information on\nthe processes that shape the relations while providing self-consistent mass\nconstraints.

We explore this question with a sample of blazars from the\nSecond Catalog of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT). The Compton dominance, the ratio of the peak of the Compton to\nthe synchrotron peak luminosities, is essentially a redshift-independent\nquantity, and thus crucial to answering this question. We find that a\ncorrelation exists between Compton dominance and the peak frequency of the\nsynchrotron component for all blazars in the sample, including ones with\nunknown redshift. We then construct a simple model to explain the blazar\nproperties in our sample, where the difference between sources is due to only\nthe magnetic field of the blazar jet emitting region, the external radiation\nfield energy density, and the jet angle to the line of sight, with the magnetic\nfield strength and external energy density being correlated. This model can\nreproduce the trends of the blazars in the sample, and predicts blazars may be\ndiscovered in the future with high synchrotron peak frequencies and\nluminosities. At the same time the simple model reproduces the lack of\nhigh-synchrotron peaked blazars with high Compton dominances (\\gtrsim 1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Dec 2012 21:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A server\npacking configuration is the vector $k = (k_i)$, where $k_i$ is the number of\ntype-$i$ customers that the server \"contains\". Packing constraints are\ndescribed by a fixed finite set of allowed configurations. Upon arrival, each\ncustomer is placed into a server immediately, subject to the packing\nconstraints; the server can be idle or already serving other customers. After\nservice completion, each customer leaves its server and the system.\n  It was shown recently that a simple real-time algorithm, called Greedy, is\nasymptotically optimal in the sense of minimizing $\\sum_k X_k^{1+\\alpha}$ in\nthe stationary regime, as the customer arrival rates grow to infinity.

Precise and accurate determinations of effective temperature and\nsurface gravity are mandatory to derive reliable chemical abundances and\nfundamental parameters like distances, masses, radii, luminosities of OB stars.\nAims. Atmospheric parameters recently determined at high precision with several\nindependent spectroscopic indicators in NLTE are employed to calibrate\nphotometric relationships. Methods. Temperatures and gravities of 30\ncalibrators are compared to reddening-independent quantities of the Johnson and\nStroemgren photometric systems. We also examine the spectral and luminosity\nclassification of the star sample and compute bolometric corrections. Results.\nCalibrations of temperatures and gravities are proposed for various photometric\nindices and spectral types. Effective temperatures can be determined at a\nprecision of ~400 K for luminosity classes III/IV and ~800 K for luminosity\nclass V. Surface gravities can reach internal uncertainties as low as ~0.08 dex\nwhen using our calibration to the Johnson Q-parameter. Similar precision is\nachieved for gravities derived from the beta-index and the precision is lower\nfor both atmospheric parameters when using the Stroemgren indices c1 and [u-b].\nOur uncertainties are smaller than typical differences among other methods in\nthe literature, reaching values up to ~2000 K for temperature and ~0.25 dex for\ngravity, and in extreme cases, ~6000 K and ~0.4 dex, respectively.

For the present\npaper we gather many of these databases into four comprehensive databases, two\nwith 384 energetic data for chemistry and solid-state physics and another two\nwith 68 structural data for chemistry and solid-state physics, and we test 2\nwave function methods and 77 density functionals (12 Minnesota meta functionals\nand 65 others) in a consistent way across this same broad set of data. We\nespecially highlight the Minnesota density functionals, but the results have\nbroader implications in that one may see the successes and failures of many\nkinds of density functionals when they are all applied to the same data.\nTherefore the results provide a status report on the quest for a universal\nfunctional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 07:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 00:35:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2013 17:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2013 17:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-09"}

A series\nof heavy petroleum fractions namely DAE, RAE, BQ-1, and asphaltenes derived\nfrom BQ-1 were used together with anthracite coal and bitumen as model\ncompounds in matching the band pattern of the emission features of\nproto-planetary nebulae (PPNe). All the model materials were examined in the\nmid-infrared (2.5-16.7 um) and for the first time in the far-infrared (16.7-200\num), and the IR bands were compared with the UIE from PPNe. The best match of\nthe PPNe band pattern is offered by the BQ-1 heavy aromatic oil fraction and by\nits asphaltenes fraction. Particularly interesting is the ability of BQ-1 to\nmatch the band pattern of the aromatic-aliphatic C-H stretching bands of\ncertain PPNe, a result which is not achieved neither by the coal model nor by\nthe other petroleum fractions considered here.

In\npractical situation, surfaces obtained from range scanners often have holes\nwhere the 3D models are incomplete. In order to analyze the 3D shapes\neffectively, restoring the incomplete shape by filling in the surface holes is\nnecessary. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal approach to inpaint\nsurface holes on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. The basic\nidea is to represent the Riemann surface using its conformal factor and mean\ncurvature. According to Riemann surface theory, a Riemann surface can be\nuniquely determined by its conformal factor and mean curvature up to a rigid\nmotion. Given a Riemann surface $S$, its mean curvature $H$ and conformal\nfactor $\\lambda$ can be computed easily through its conformal parameterization.\nConversely, given $\\lambda$ and $H$, a Riemann surface can be uniquely\nreconstructed by solving the Gauss-Codazzi equation on the conformal parameter\ndomain. Hence, the conformal factor and the mean curvature are two geometric\nquantities fully describing the surface. With this $\\lambda$-$H$ representation\nof the surface, the problem of surface inpainting can be reduced to the problem\nof image inpainting of $\\lambda$ and $H$ on the conformal parameter domain.\nOnce $\\lambda$ and $H$ are inpainted, a Riemann surface can be reconstructed\nwhich effectively restores the 3D surface with missing holes. Since the\ninpainting model is based on the geometric quantities $\\lambda$ and $H$, the\nrestored surface follows the surface geometric pattern. We test the proposed\nalgorithm on synthetic data as well as real surface data. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed method is an effective surface inpainting algorithm to\nfill in surface holes on an incomplete 3D models based their surface geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 10:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

Due to the\nhigh structural quality of the superlattice and the substrate, the specular\nreflectivity signal extends with a high signal-to-background ratio beyond the\nfourth order superlattice Bragg peak. This allows us to obtain more detailed\nand reliable information about the magnetic depth profile than in previous PNR\nstudies on similar superlattices that were partially impeded by problems\nrelated to the low temperature structural transitions of the SrTiO3 substrates.\nIn agreement with the previous reports, our PNR data reveal a strong magnetic\nproximity effect showing that the depth profile of the magnetic potential\ndiffers significantly from the one of the nuclear potential that is given by\nthe YBCO and LCMO layer thickness. We present fits of the PNR data using\ndifferent simple block-like models for which either a ferromagnetic moment is\ninduced on the YBCO side of the interfaces or the ferromagnetic order is\nsuppressed on the LCMO side.

This latter group includes about half of the Low Ionization\nNuclear Emission-line region (LINERs) or transition galaxies of the sample, all\nof which are objects of low [OIII] line luminosity (<~1E38 erg s-1) and low\nequivalent width (<~1 A) in ground-based observations.

A Monte Carlo (MC) scattering model was used to derive dust\nproperties such as mass loss rates and ejection velocities as a function of\ntime.

The MBC present a narrow almost linear tail that extends up to 40.000\nkm in the anti-solar direction and more than 80.000 km in the direction of the\nobject's orbital plane. The color of the tail is slightly redder than the Sun\n(S=3 to 6%/1000A).

We report all activities for physics teachers in the context of\nthe National Plan for Scientific Degrees in Southern Tuscany. Research and\npractice have shown that physics teaching in school is inadequate. The main\nconsequences are limited achievements in school, decrease of students'\ninterests in learning physics and decrease of enrolments in physics in many\ncountries. In recent years, the decline in enrolments was faced up with the\nlaunch of a wide national project addressed to secondary school students and\nteachers. The active involvement of teachers in the design of laboratories was\nfound to be essential for obtaining actions which were not transitory and\nentered permanently in classroom practice. We describe some advanced courses in\nPhysics and Mathematics Education realized few years ago and courses designed\nfor a Master in Physics Educational Innovation and Orienting performed jointly\nby many Italian universities. Other activities are less formal but equally\nrelevant, such as the active involvement of expert, young and in training\nteachers in designing and implementation of laboratory activities for a summer\nschool of physics. Recently, we developed a workshop for teachers of physics\nand mathematics on modelling. which continued in an updating course for\nteachers in which selected topics, named in the same way in both disciplines,\nwere discussed in order to design interdisciplinary learning paths. The purpose\nis to clarify these topics by using specific tools from physics and mathematics\nand to outline the similarities and the differences in both contexts.

Consistency is in a\ntrade-off relation with operation latency in the distributed and replicated\nscenario. Existing NoSQL stores guarantee either strong or weak consistencies\nbut none provides the best consistency based on the response latency. In this\npaper, we introduce dConssandra, a NoSQL store enabling users to specify\nlatency bounds for data access operations. dConssandra dynamically bounds data\naccess latency by trading off replica consistency. dConssandra is based on\nCassandra. In comparison to Cassandra's implementation, dConssandra has a\nstaged replication strategy enabling synchronous or asynchronous replication on\ndemand. The main idea to bound latency by trading off consistency is to\ndecompose the replication process into minute steps and bound latency by\nexecuting only a subset of these steps. dConssandra also implements a different\nin-memory storage architecture to support the above features. Experimental\nresults for dConssandra over an actual cluster demonstrate that (1) the actual\nresponse latency is bounded by the given latency constraint; (2) greater write\nlatency bounds lead to a lower latency in reading the latest value; and, (3)\ngreater read latency bounds lead to the return of more recently written values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 15:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-06"}

Since the most heavily\nobscured post-AGB sources can be expected to descend from the most massive PN\nprogenitors, these should exhibit clear asymmetric morphologies.

We have\ndetected extended emission from the four objects in our sample and resolved it\ninto several structural components that are greatly enhanced in the temperature\nand optical depth maps.

The heavily obscured sources in our\nsample do not show extreme axisymmetric morphologies.

A subset of those strategies are 'extortioners' which\nensure that any increase in the own payoff exceeds that of the other player by\na fixed percentage. Here we analyze the evolutionary performance of this new\nclass of strategies. We show that in reasonably large populations they can act\nas catalysts for the evolution of cooperation, similar to tit-for-tat, but they\nare not the stable outcome of natural selection. In very small populations,\nhowever, relative payoff differences between two players in a contest matter,\nand extortioners hold their ground. Extortion strategies do particularly well\nin co-evolutionary arms races between two distinct populations: significantly,\nthey benefit the population which evolves at the slower rate - an instance of\nthe so-called Red King effect. This may affect the evolution of interactions\nbetween host species and their endosymbionts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 15:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Unfortunately, simple counterexamples show that if uniform convexity is\nremoved, then instability can occur. Since Voronoi diagrams in normed spaces\nwhich are not uniformly convex do appear in theory and practice, e.g., in the\nplane with the Manhattan (ell_1) distance, it is natural to ask whether the\nstability property can be generalized to them, perhaps under additional\nassumptions. This paper shows that this is indeed the case assuming the unit\nsphere of the space has a certain (non-exotic) structure and the sites satisfy\na certain \"general position\" condition related to it. The condition on the unit\nsphere is that it can be decomposed into at most one \"rotund part\" and at most\nfinitely many non-degenerate convex parts.

For zigzag and bearded GNRs, the topological edge\nstate can be tuned to be either at the interface or outer edge of the normal\nribbon. For armchair GNR, the potential location of the topological edge state\ncan be further enriched to be at the edge of or within the normal ribbon, at\nthe interface, or diving into the topological GNR.
