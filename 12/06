This long time\nspan enabled us to refine the rotational ephemeris and observe a downturn in\nthe decay of the X-ray flux. Assuming a broken power law for the long-term\nlight curve, the break was at ~46 d after the outburst onset, when the decay\nindex changed from alpha ~ 0.4 to ~4.5. The flux decreased by a factor ~2 in\nthe first ~50 d and then by a factor ~40 until November 2011 (overall, by a\nfactor ~70 in ~100 d). At the same time, the spectrum, which was well described\nby an absorbed blackbody all along the outburst, softened, the temperature\ndropping from ~1 to ~0.6 keV. Diffuse X-ray emission extending up to 20\" from\nthe source was clearly detected in all Chandra observations. Its spatial and\nspectral properties, as well as its time evolution, are consistent with a\ndust-scattering halo due to a single cloud located at a distance of\n$\\approx$200 pc from Swift J1834.9-0846, which should be in turn located at a\ndistance of ~5 kpc.

It has been long believed that inflation\ncannot be the solution since it requires an extremely low entropy to ever\noccur. However, we point out that since the inflation is always accompanied\nwith a horizon, the correct probability of inflation is associated with the\nquantum entanglement entropy, which should in principle be larger than what\nconsidered previously. This motivates us to reexamine the issue by computing\nthe evolution of the cosmological entanglement entropy in the early universe.\nWe invoke a toy model of nonlinear generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG), which has\nthe advantage of providing a smooth and unitary transition between the\ninflation epoch and the radiation dominant era. We found that soon after the\nonset of the inflation, the total entanglement entropy rapidly decreases to a\nminimum, and it rises monotonically afterwards throughout the remainder of the\ninflation and the radiation epochs. This indicates that the universe does not\nneed to begin with an extremely low entropy; its smallness can be naturally\ninduced by the dynamics of inflation itself. We believe that our computation\nlargely captures the essential feature of entropy evolution and can provide us\ninsights beyond the toy model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 16:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 May 2013 16:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

However, they do not predict whether incurring the cost of\nobtaining more data and undergoing further training will lead to higher\naccuracy. In this paper we investigate techniques for making such early\npredictions. We note that when a machine learning algorithm is presented with a\ntraining set the classifier produced, and hence its error, will depend on the\ncharacteristics of the algorithm, on training set's size, and also on its\nspecific composition. In particular we hypothesise that if a number of\nclassifiers are produced, and their observed error is decomposed into bias and\nvariance terms, then although these components may behave differently, their\nbehaviour may be predictable.\n  We test our hypothesis by building models that, given a measurement taken\nfrom the classifier created from a limited number of samples, predict the\nvalues that would be measured from the classifier produced when the full data\nset is presented. We create separate models for bias, variance and total error.\nOur models are built from the results of applying ten different machine\nlearning algorithms to a range of data sets, and tested with \"unseen\"\nalgorithms and datasets.

We address the algorithm's\nstability and establish multiple convergence properties of \"Optimal AdaBoost,\"\na term coined by Rudin, Daubechies, and Schapire in 2004. We prove, in a\nreasonably strong computational sense, the almost universal existence of time\naverages, and with that, the convergence of the classifier itself, its\ngeneralization error, and its resulting margins, among many other objects, for\nfixed data sets under arguably reasonable conditions. Specifically, we frame\nOptimal AdaBoost as a dynamical system and, employing tools from ergodic\ntheory, prove that, under a condition that Optimal AdaBoost does not have ties\nfor best weak classifier eventually, a condition for which we provide empirical\nevidence from high dimensional real-world datasets, the algorithm's update\nbehaves like a continuous map. We provide constructive proofs of several\narbitrarily accurate approximations of Optimal AdaBoost; prove that they\nexhibit certain cycling behavior in finite time, and that the resulting\ndynamical system is ergodic; and establish sufficient conditions for the same\nto hold for the actual Optimal-AdaBoost update. We believe that our results\nprovide reasonably strong evidence for the affirmative answer to two open\nconjectures, at least from a broad computational-theory perspective: AdaBoost\nalways cycles and is an ergodic dynamical system. We present empirical evidence\nthat cycles are hard to detect while time averages stabilize quickly. Our\nresults ground future convergence-rate analysis and may help optimize\ngeneralization ability and alleviate a practitioner's burden of deciding how\nlong to run the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 17:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 16:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2023 23:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

Following an\nidea of De Giorgi, they gave a new definition of current which was meaningful\non any metric space. A metric current is a multilinear functional on\n(k+1)-tuples of Lipschitz functions (with the first one bounded) satisfying a\ncontinuity property, a locality property and a finite mass property. The second\nchapter of the thesis is devoted to the theory of local metric currents. We\nintroduce the basic concepts and adapt the theory to the complex case, defining\nthe bidimension, the Dolbeault decomposition and related notions. A\ncharacterization of holomorphic currents is given. The development of a Sobolev\ntheory on singular space is our main concern in the third chapter. We give a\ncharacterization of Sobolev functions in terms of their behavior and growth on\nthe regular part; this leads to a capacity theory for the singular set which\nallows us to obtain an approximation result, using functions with support in\nthe regular part. The second part of the chapter deals with the L2 theory on\nsingular spaces. In the fourth chapter, some applications of the theory are\ndiscussed. We solve Cauchy-Riemann equation on completely reducible\nsingularities, by means of a structure theorem for metric currents; we also\ntreat the equation in Lp on complex curves and outline a possible approach for\nthe same problem on complex spaces which can be embedded as divisors in C^n.\nThe final chapter tries to spread some light on the complex geometry in\ninfinite dimensional spaces. After solving the Cauchy-Riemann equation in\nBanach spaces, in terms of the quasi-local metric currents, we turn to the\nstudy of positive currents, holomorphic chains and their boundaries in Hilbert\nspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 17:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-06"}

Theoretical work and empirical\ninvestigation in Escherichia coli have shown that negative autoregulation\nconfers both rapid response times and reduced intrinsic noise, which is\nreflected in the fact that almost half of Escherichia coli transcription\nfactors are negatively autoregulated. However, negative autoregulation is\nexceedingly rare amongst the transcription factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nThis difference is all the more surprising because E. coli and S. cerevisiae\notherwise have remarkably similar profiles of network motifs. In this study we\nfirst show that regulatory interactions amongst the transcription factors of\nDrosophila melanogaster and humans have a similar dearth of negative\nautoregulation to that seen in S. cerevisiae. We then present a model\ndemonstrating that this fundamental difference in the noise reduction\nstrategies used amongst species can be explained by constraints on the\nevolution of negative autoregulation in diploids. We show that regulatory\ninteractions between pairs of homologous genes within the same cell can lead to\nunder-dominance - mutations which result in stronger autoregulation, and\ndecrease noise in homozygotes, paradoxically can cause increased noise in\nheterozygotes. This severely limits a diploid's ability to evolve negative\nautoregulation as a noise reduction mechanism. Our work offers a simple and\ngeneral explanation for a previously unexplained difference between the\nregulatory architectures of E. coli and yeast, Drosophila and humans.

This means\nthat such systems will lead towards their most likely state, that is, the one\nwith the most homogeneous probability distribution. However, Boltzmann states\nthat entropy-decreasing processes can occur (without doing any work) - it is\njust very improbable. It is therefore not impossible, in principle, for all 6 x\n10^23 atoms in a mole of a gas to spontaneously move to one half of a\ncontainer; it is only fantastically unlikely.\n  A similar idea has here been applied to a human cell. All somatic cells seem\nto age and deteriorate in unfavorable conditions. If the ageing process is\ndefined as the accumulation of dysfunctional polymers resulting from, among\nother things, chemical bond breakage, where polymers aggregate into harmful\narrangements, spreading out randomly in the cell and leading to an altered\nfunction, then it also applies that there will be a difference in entropy\nbetween, for instance, a 20-year old individual and the same individual at age\n80.\n  The goal of this article is to demonstrate that the second law does not tell\nus that the cell necessarily must go toward a high entropy state and stay that\nway but that it is possible - according to statistical mechanics - for an old\ncell to experience a return to a younger state.

The model is an extension of\ncurrently used continuous complexity models, with a class of algorithms in the\nform of optimization methods, in which an optimization functional (involving\nthe data) is minimized. This extends the family of current approaches in\ncontinuous complexity theory, which include the use of interpolatory algorithms\nin worst and average case settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Dec 2012 21:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-07"}

A\nFeshbach resonance turns off atom-atom interactions in one spin subsystem,\nmaking it a well-characterized reference state, while atoms in the other\nsubsystem undergo nonequilibrium dynamics for a variable hold time. Interfering\nthe subsystems via a second beam-splitting operation, time-resolved quadrature\nmeasurements on the interacting atoms are obtained by detecting relative spin\npopulations.

The key technical contribution is the lattice-based\nachievability strategy, where each relay is able to remove the noise while\ndecoding the sum of several signals in a Block Markov strategy and then\nre-encode the signal into another lattice codeword using the so-called\n\"Re-distribution Transform\". This allows nodes further down the line to again\ndecode sums of lattice codewords.

If our deconvolution is correct, then the T_eff = 300 K cloud-free model\nfluxes at K and W2 are too faint by 0.5 - 1.0 magnitudes. We will address this\ndiscrepancy in our next generation of models, which will incorporate water\nclouds and mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 00:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2012 02:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

To\nminimize the selection effect on galaxy clustering, we construct well-defined\nluminosity and color subsamples by carefully accounting for the CMASS galaxy\nselection cuts. The 2PCF of the whole CMASS sample, if approximated by a\npower-law, has a correlation length of r_0=7.93\\pm0.06Mpc/h and an index of\n\\gamma=1.85\\pm0.01. Clear dependences on galaxy luminosity and color are found\nfor the projected 2PCF in all redshift bins, with more luminous and redder\ngalaxies generally exhibiting stronger clustering and steeper 2PCF. The color\ndependence is also clearly seen for galaxies within the red sequence,\nconsistent with the behavior of SDSS-II main sample galaxies at lower\nredshifts. At a given luminosity (k+e corrected), no significant evolution of\nthe projected 2PCFs with redshift is detected for red sequence galaxies. We\nalso construct galaxy samples of fixed number density at different redshifts,\nusing redshift-dependent magnitude thresholds. The clustering of these galaxies\nin the CMASS redshift range is found to be consistent with that predicted by\npassive evolution.

The competition decreases the\nvariability of the time to cellular activation, and hence results in a more\nsynchronous activation of cells. We argue that, in simple models, this\nvariability reduction does not necessarily interfere with the receptor\nspecificity to ligands achieved by the kinetic proofreading mechanism. Thus\ncells can be activated accurately in time and specifically to certain signals.\nWe predict the minimum number of receptors needed to reduce the coefficient of\nvariation for the time to activation following binding of a specific ligand.\nFurther, we predict the maximum number of receptors so that the kinetic\nproofreading mechanism still can improve the specificity of the activation.\nThese predictions fall in line with experimentally reported receptor numbers\nfor multiple systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 03:26:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 20:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

These tissues are\nmaintained by a population of stem cells, which generate differentiated\nprogenies and self-renew. Asymmetric division of each stem cell into one stem\ncell and one differentiated cell can accomplish both tasks. However, in\nmammalian cycling tissues, some stem cells divide symmetrically into two\ndifferentiated cells and are replaced by a neighbor that divides symmetrically\ninto two stem cells. Besides this heterogeneity in fate (population asymmetry),\nstem cells also exhibit heterogenous proliferation-rates; in the long run,\nhowever, all stem cells proliferate at the same average rate (equipotency). We\nconstruct and simulate a mathematical model based on these experimental\nobservations. We show that the complex steady-state dynamics of\npopulation-asymmetric stem cells reduces the rate of replicative aging of the\ntissue --potentially lowering the incidence of somatic mutations and genetics\ndiseases such as cancer. Essentially, slow-dividing stem cells proliferate and\npurge the population of the fast-dividing --older-- cells which had undertaken\nthe majority of the tissue-generation burden. As the number of slow-dividing\ncells grows, their proliferation-rate increases, eventually turning them into\nfast-dividers, which are themselves replaced by newly emerging slow-dividers.\nGoing beyond current experiments, we propose a mechanism for equipotency that\ncan potentially halve the rate of replicative aging.

For the case that W is finite\nthis gives a complete characterisation.\n  For the case that W is the set of natural numbers we show that for nearly all\nfunctions b a stationary product measure is ergodic if and only if it is\nsupported by configurations with an infinite amount of particles. We show that\nthis picture is not complete, we give an example of a system where b is such\nthat there is a stationary product measure which is not ergodic, even though it\nconcentrates on configurations with an infinite number of particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 11:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-24"}

Here, we propose a scheme for entangling two given\nphotons based on this effect. We consider a linear-optics set-up with an\nabsorber medium whose two-photon absorption rate $\\xi_{2\\gamma}$ exceeds the\none-photon loss rate $\\xi_{1\\gamma}$. In order to reach an error probability\n$P_{\\rm error}$, we need $\\xi_{1\\gamma}/\\xi_{2\\gamma}<2P_{\\rm error}^2/\\pi^2$,\nwhich is a factor of 64 better than previous approaches (e.g., by Franson et\nal). Since typical media have $\\xi_{2\\gamma}<\\xi_{1\\gamma}$, we discuss three\nmechanisms for enhancing two-photon absorption as compared to one-photon loss.\nThe first mechanism again employs the quantum Zeno effect via self-interference\neffects when sending two photons repeatedly through the same absorber. The\nsecond mechanism is based on coherent excitations of many atoms and exploits\nthe fact that $\\xi_{2\\gamma}$ scales with the number of excitations but\n$\\xi_{1\\gamma}$ does not.

The high spatial resolution allowed us to detect\nbright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions at 8.6micron and\n11.3micron in the galaxy centre (26 pc) up to a radius of 70 pc from the\nnucleus. The spectra also present [Ne ii]12.8micron ionic lines, and H2\nS(2)12.27micron molecular gas line. We found that the PAHs profiles are similar\nto Peeters's A class, with the line peak shifted towards the blue. The\ndifferences in the PAH line profiles also suggests that the molecules in the\nregion located 26 pc NE of the nucleus are more in the neutral than in the\nionised state, while at 26 pc SW of the nucleus, the molecules are mainly in\nionised state. After removal of the underlying galaxy contribution, the nuclear\nspectrum can be represented by a Nenkova's clumpy torus model, indicating that\nthe nucleus of NGC 1808 hosts a dusty toroidal structure with an angular cloud\ndistribution of sigma = 70degree, observer's view angle i = 90degree, and an\nouter radius of R0 = 0.55 pc. The derived column density along the line of\nsight is NH = 1.5 x 10^24 cm-2, which is sufficient to block the hard radiation\nfrom the active nucleus, and would explain the presence of PAH molecules near\nto the NGC 1808's active nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 15:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 17:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Firstly, equal number 3 of SM\nparticle generations coincide with the dimension number of outer euclidean\n3-space and secondly, the factual SM particle mass and mixing hierarchies at\nleading approximation appear solutions of the Metric equation for unit vector\ndirection angles in euclidean 3-space geometry.

Its\ndistinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6-m-diameter\nby 12.5-m-length free bore, enclosed inside a 10000-ton return yoke made of\nconstruction steel. The return yoke consists of five dodecagonal three-layered\nbarrel wheels and four end-cap disks at each end comprised of steel blocks up\nto 620 mm thick, which serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection\nsystem. Accurate characterization of the magnetic field everywhere in the CMS\ndetector is required. To measure the field in and around the steel, a system of\n22 flux-loops and 82 3-D Hall sensors is installed on the return yoke blocks.\nFast discharges of the solenoid (190 s time-constant) made during the CMS\nmagnet surface commissioning test at the solenoid central fields of 2.64, 3.16,\n3.68 and 4.01 T were used to induce voltages in the flux-loops.

The\n3-D Hall sensors installed on the steel-air interfaces give supplementary\ninformation on the components of magnetic field and permit to estimate the\nremanent field in steel to be added to the magnetic flux density obtained by\nthe voltages integration.

In UW-OFDM the cyclic\nprefixes (CPs) are replaced by deterministic sequences, the so-called unique\nwords (UWs). The UWs are generated by appropriately loading a set of redundant\nsubcarriers. By that a systematic complex number Reed Solomon (RS) code\nconstruction is introduced in a quite natural way, because an RS code may be\ndefined as the set of vectors, for which a block of successive zeros occurs in\nthe other domain w.r.t. a discrete Fourier transform. (For a fixed block\ndifferent to zero, i.e., a UW, a coset code of an RS code is generated.) A\nremaining problem in the original systematic coded UW-OFDM concept is the fact\nthat the redundant subcarrier symbols disproportionately contribute to the mean\nOFDM symbol energy. In this paper we introduce the concept of non-systematic\ncoded UW-OFDM, where the redundancy is no longer allocated to dedicated\nsubcarriers, but distributed over all subcarriers. We derive optimum complex\nvalued code generator matrices matched to the BLUE (best linear unbiased\nestimator) and to the LMMSE (linear minimum mean square error) data estimator,\nrespectively. With the help of simulations we highlight the advantageous\nspectral properties and the superior BER (bit error ratio) performance of\nnon-systematic coded UW-OFDM compared to systematic coded UW-OFDM as well as to\nCP-OFDM in AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) and in frequency selective\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 13:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-10"}
