Various\napproximate analytical formulae for a single stationary vortex are recalled and\ntheir shortcomings demonstrated. Significantly more accurate two-point [2/2]\nand [3/3] Pade' approximants for stationary vortex profiles are presented. Two\nstraight, singly quantized, antiparallel vortices, located at a distance d\napart, form a vortex dipole, which, in the GP model, can either annihilate or\npropagate indefinitely as a `solitary wave'. We show, through calculations\nperformed in a periodic domain, that the details and types of behavior\ndisplayed by vortex dipoles depend strongly on the initial conditions rather\nthan only on the separation distance (as has been previously claimed). It is\nfound, indeed, that the choice of the initial two-vortex profile (i.e., the\nmodulus of the `effective wave function'), strongly affects the vortex\ntrajectories and the time scale of the process: annihilation proceeds more\nrapidly when low-energy (or `relaxed') initial profiles are imposed. The\ninitial `circular' phase distribution contours, customarily obtained by\nmultiplying an effective wave function for each individual vortex, can be\ngeneralized to explicit elliptical forms specified by two parameters; then by\n`tuning' the elliptical shape at fixed d, a sharp transition between\nsolitary-wave propagation and annihilation is captured. Thereby, a `phase\ndiagram' for this `AnSol' transition is constructed in the space of ellipticity\nand separation and various limiting forms of the boundary are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2012 16:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

This material is central to many fundamental questions in nuclear\nphysics and astrophysics. Moreover, neutron rich matter is being studied with\nan extraordinary variety of new tools such as the Facility for Rare Isotope\nBeams (FRIB) and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory\n(LIGO). We describe the Lead Radius Experiment (PREX) that uses parity\nviolating electron scattering to measure the neutron radius of 208Pb. This has\nimportant implications for neutron stars and their crusts. We discuss X-ray\nobservations of neutron star radii. These also have important implications for\nneutron rich matter. Gravitational waves (GW) open a new window on neutron rich\nmatter. They come from sources such as neutron star mergers, rotating neutron\nstar mountains, and collective r-mode oscillations. Using large scale molecular\ndynamics simulations, we find neutron star crust to be very strong. It can\nsupport mountains on rotating neutron stars large enough to generate detectable\ngravitational waves. Finally, neutrinos from core collapse supernovae (SN)\nprovide another, qualitatively different probe of neutron rich matter.\nNeutrinos escape from the surface of last scattering known as the\nneutrino-sphere. This is a low density warm gas of neutron rich matter.\nNeutrino-sphere conditions can be simulated in the laboratory with heavy ion\ncollisions. Observations of neutrinos can probe nucleosyntheses in SN. We\nbelieve that combing astronomical observations using photons, GW, and\nneutrinos, with laboratory experiments on nuclei, heavy ion collisions, and\nradioactive beams will fundamentally advance our knowledge of compact objects\nin the heavens, the dense phases of QCD, the origin of the elements, and of\nneutron rich matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2012 18:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

This is motivated by the fact that flow rate is the\nmain physical quantity which can be actually measured in many practical\nsituations. We propose a novel numerical strategy, which is nonetheless\ngrounded on several analytical relations. The proposed method leads to the\nsolution of some simple ordinary differential systems.

The coupling consistently includes\nexcess (positive or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the\ndisplaced fluid, and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum\nequation. The coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip\nconstraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the fluid\nvelocity, and conserves momentum and energy. We demonstrate that the\nformulation obeys a fluctuation-dissipation balance, owing to the\nnon-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. We develop a spatio-temporal\ndiscretization that preserves, as best as possible, these properties of the\ncontinuum formulation. In the spatial discretization, the local averaging and\nspreading operations are accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in\nimmersed boundary methods. We find that the special properties of these kernels\nmake the discrete blob a particle with surprisingly physically-consistent\nvolume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties. We develop a second-order\nsemi-implicit temporal integrator that maintains discrete\nfluctuation-dissipation balance, and is not limited in stability by viscosity.\nFurthermore, the temporal scheme requires only constant-coefficient Poisson and\nHelmholtz linear solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple FFT-based\nimplementation on GPUs.

The proposed general\nformulation allows to accommodate several (transmit) power and\n(deterministic/probabilistic) interference constraints, such as constraints on\nthe maximum individual and/or aggregate (probabilistic) interference tolerable\nat the primary receivers. To keep the optimization as decentralized as\npossible, global (coupling) interference constraints are imposed by penalizing\neach SU with a set of time-varying prices based upon his contribution to the\ntotal interference; the prices are thus additional variable to optimize. The\nresulting players' optimization problems are nonconvex; moreover, there are\npossibly price clearing conditions associated with the global constraints to be\nsatisfied by the solution.

Many approaches have been proposed to lower\nthe error floor by designing new LDPC codes with fewer such substructures or by\nmodifying the decoding algorithm. Using a theoretical analysis of iterative MP\ndecoding in an idealized trapping set scenario, we show that a contributor to\nthe error floors observed in the literature may be the imprecise implementation\nof decoding algorithms and, in particular, the message quantization rules used.\nWe then propose a new quantization method -- (q+1)-bit quasi-uniform\nquantization -- that efficiently increases the dynamic range of messages,\nthereby overcoming a limitation of conventional quantization schemes. Finally,\nwe use the quasi-uniform quantizer to decode several LDPC codes that suffer\nfrom high error floors with traditional fixed-point decoder implementations.\nThe performance simulation results provide evidence that the proposed\nquantization scheme can, for a wide variety of codes, significantly lower error\nfloors with minimal increase in decoder complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 05:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2013 22:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-11"}

For state points in the plane of aspect ratio (k=1-9) and area\nfraction (phi=0.01-0.8), we identify three different phases, including\nisotropic, plastic and nematic states. The equation of state (EOS) is shown for\na wide range of aspect ratios and is compared with the scaled particle theory\n(SPT) for the isotropic states. We find that SPT provides a good description of\nthe EOS for the isotropic phase of hard ellipses. At large fixed phi, the\nreduced pressure p increases with k in both the isotropic and the plastic\nphases, and interestingly, its dependence on k is rather weak in the nematic\nphase. We rationalize the thermodynamics of hard ellipses in terms of particle\nmotions. The plastic crystal is shown to form for aspect ratios up to k=1.4,\nwhile appearance of the stable nematic phase starts approximately at k=3.

The method\nhas been already proven to provide manganite films with good magnetic\nproperties, but the films were generally relatively rough (a few nm\ncoarseness). Here we show that increasing the oxygen deposition pressure with\nrespect to previously used regimes, reduces the surface roughness down to unit\ncell size while maintaining a robust magnetism. We analyse in detail the effect\nof other deposition parameters, like accelerating voltage, discharging energy,\nand temperature and provide on this basis a set of optimal conditions for the\ngrowth of atomically flat films. The thicknesses for which atomically flat\nsurface was achieved is as high as about 10-20 nm, corresponding to films with\nroom temperature magnetism. We believe such magnetic layers represent appealing\nand suitable electrodes for various spintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 14:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Asymptotic expressions of the symbol-error probability (SEP) and the\nminimum mean-square error (MMSE) achieved by estimating the channel input given\nthe channel output are also developed. It is shown that for any input\ndistribution, the conditional entropy of the channel input given the output,\nMMSE and SEP have an asymptotic behavior proportional to the Gaussian\nQ-function. The argument of the Q-function depends only on the minimum\nEuclidean distance (MED) of the constellation and the SNR, and the\nproportionality constants are functions of the MED and the probabilities of the\npairs of constellation points at MED. The developed expressions are then\ngeneralized to study the high-SNR behavior of the generalized mutual\ninformation (GMI) for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM). By means of\nthese asymptotic expressions, the long-standing conjecture that Gray codes are\nthe binary labelings that maximize the BICM-GMI at high SNR is proven.

Over the past few\ndecades, several theories of emotion have been proposed, each based around the\nexistence of a set of 'basic emotions', and each supported by an extensive\nvariety of research including studies in facial expression, ethology, neurology\nand physiology. Here we present research based on a theory that people transmit\ntheir understanding of emotions through the language they use surrounding\nemotion keywords. Using a labelled corpus of over 21,000 tweets, six of the\nbasic emotion sets proposed in existing literature were analysed using Latent\nSemantic Clustering (LSC), evaluating the distinctiveness of the semantic\nmeaning attached to the emotional label. We hypothesise that the more distinct\nthe language is used to express a certain emotion, then the more distinct the\nperception (including proprioception) of that emotion is, and thus more\n'basic'. This allows us to select the dimensions best representing the entire\nspectrum of emotion. We find that Ekman's set, arguably the most frequently\nused for classifying emotions, is in fact the most semantically distinct\noverall. Next, taking all analysed (that is, previously proposed) emotion terms\ninto account, we determine the optimal semantically irreducible basic emotion\nset using an iterative LSC algorithm. Our newly-derived set (Accepting,\nAshamed, Contempt, Interested, Joyful, Pleased, Sleepy, Stressed) generates a\n6.1% increase in distinctiveness over Ekman's set (Angry, Disgusted, Joyful,\nSad, Scared). We also demonstrate how using LSC data can help visualise\nemotions. We introduce the concept of an Emotion Profile and briefly analyse\ncompound emotions both visually and mathematically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 15:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-07"}
