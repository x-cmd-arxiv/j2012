The hot\ngas was represented by two thin thermal plasmas with temperatures of kT ~0.2\nand ~0.6 keV. Abundance ratios i.e., O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe and Si/Fe, are\nconsistent between three regions, which suggests the common origin of the hot\ngas. The abundance patterns are consistent with those of type II supernova\nejecta, indicating that the starburst activity in the central region provides\nmetals toward the halo through a galactic-scale starburst-driven outflow.

This\nwork attempts to detect the same in a social networking platform by considering\na social network as a weighted graph wherein each node, which represents an\nindividual in the social network, stores activities of other nodes with respect\nto itself in an optimized format which is referred to as localized data-set.\nThe weights associated with the edges in the graph represent the trust\nrelationship between profiles. The weights of the edges along with the\nlocalized data-set is used to infer whether nodes in the social network are\ncompromised and are performing spam or malicious activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2012 20:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}

In a recent paper [1], we proposed\na Bianchi classification of the extremal near-horizon geometries in five\ndimensions, in the case where they are homogeneous but, in general,\nanisotropic. Here, we extend our study in two directions: we show that Bianchi\nattractors can lead to new phases, and generalize the classification of\nhomogeneous phases in a way suggested by holography. In the first direction, we\nshow that hyperscaling violation can naturally be incorporated into the Bianchi\nhorizons. We also find analytical examples of \"striped\" horizons. In the second\ndirection, we propose a more complete classification of homogeneous horizon\ngeometries where the natural mathematics involves real four-algebras with three\ndimensional sub-algebras. This gives rise to a richer set of possible\nnear-horizon geometries, where the holographic radial direction is\nnon-trivially intertwined with field theory spatial coordinates.

To\nstudy the influence of merger processes on the evolution of dust properties and\ncosmic star formation rate, we investigate a local sample of major merger\ngalaxies and a control sample of isolated galaxies using GALEX ultraviolet (UV)\nand Spitzer infrared (IR) images. Through a statistical study, we find that\ndust attenuation in merger galaxies is enhanced with respect to isolated\ngalaxies. We find this enhancement is contributed mainly by spiral galaxies in\nspiral-spiral (S-S) pairs, and increases with the increasing stellar mass of a\ngalaxy. Combining the IR and UV parts of star formation rates (SFRs), we then\ncalculated the total SFRs and specific star formation rates (SSFRs). We find\nthe SSFRs to be enhanced in merger galaxies. This enhancement depends on galaxy\nstellar mass and the companion's morphology, but depends little on whether the\ngalaxy is a primary or secondary component or on the separation between two\ncomponents. These results are consistent with a previous study based only on IR\nimages. In addition, we investigate the nuclear contributions to SFRs. SFRs in\npaired galaxies are more concentrated in the central part of the galaxies than\nin isolate galaxies. Our studies of dust attenuation show that the nuclear\nparts of pairs most resemble ULIRGs.

We do this by describing, in great detail, an\nelementary example of reduction of a lightly dissipative system modeling\ncrawling-type locomotion in 3D. The symmetry group SE(2) is the set of rigid\ntransformations of the horizontal (ground) plane. Given a time-periodic\nperturbation, the system will admit a relative limit cycle whereupon each\nperiod is related to the previous by a fixed translation and rotation along the\nground. This toy model identifies how symmetry reduction and dissipation can\nconspire to create robust behavior in crawling, and possibly walking,\nlocomotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 06:25:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2013 10:49:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Jul 2013 21:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 16:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 09:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 18:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 17:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-09"}

In presence of a magnetic\nfield in the corona, the electron distribution can appear thermal, even when\nacceleration mechanisms would produce non thermal distributions. This is due to\nfast and efficient thermalization through synchrotron self-absorption. We have\nanalyzed data from 6 years of observations of Cygnus X-1 with the INTEGRAL\nobservatory and produced 12 high-quality, stacked broad-band hard X-ray spectra\nrepresentative of the whole range of spectral shapes observed. We then fit\nthese spectra with hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonization models and study\nthe evolution of the physical parameters of the accretion flow across the\nspectral transition. In particular, we use the BELM model to constrain the\nmagnetic field in the corona through its effects on the coronal emission.\nIndeed, the hot electrons of the X-ray corona produce soft (optical-UV)\nsynchrotron radiation which is then Comptonized and may affect the temperature\nof the electrons through Compton cooling. We find that in the SS, the emission\nis dominated by Comptonization of the disc photons and the magnetic field is at\nmost of the order of 1E+06 G. In the hard states, the data are consistent with\na pure synchrotron self-Compton model. If the non-thermal excess observed above\na few hundred keV in the HS is produced in the same region as the bulk of the\nthermal Comptonization, we obtain an upper limit on the coronal magnetic field\nof about 1E+05 G.

Basically, steganography is a technique for\nhiding data such as messages into another form of data such as images.\nCurrently, many types of steganography are in use; however, there is yet no\nknown steganography application for query languages such as SQL. This paper\nproposes a new steganography method for textual data. It encodes input text\nmessages into SQL carriers made up of SELECT queries. In effect, the output SQL\ncarrier is dynamically generated out of the input message using a dictionary of\nwords implemented as a hash table and organized into 65 categories, each of\nwhich represents a particular character in the language. Generally speaking,\nevery character in the message to hide is mapped to a random word from a\ncorresponding category in the dictionary. Eventually, all input characters are\ntransformed into output words which are then put together to form an SQL query.\nExperiments conducted, showed how the proposed method can operate on real\nexamples proving the theory behind it. As future work, other types of SQL\nqueries are to be researched including INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE queries,\nmaking the SQL carrier quite puzzling for malicious third parties to recuperate\nthe secret message that it encodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 14:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}

According to one of them, an X-shaped source is indeed\na cross whose one arm is associated with a double radio source that has changed\nits orientation in space, while the other arm is associated with relic lobes\nand its position indicates the former direction of the jets. Here, I present\ntwo new arguments in favour of this conjecture. Firstly, it is obvious that\nshortly after the repositioning, the pair of the new lobes must be very\ncompact. To illustrate such a possibility, I show an EVN image of the central\ncomponent of a triple source J1625+2712. When resolved, it appears as a compact\ndouble that is not aligned with the outer double so the whole source is indeed\nX-shaped. Secondly, I consider the situation when one of the arms of an\nX-shaped source is not intrinsically short but foreshortened by projection. I\nshow two examples of triple sources whose central component is a blazar and the\nspan of the lobes that straddle it amounts to more than 6\\times10^5 pc.

Quantifying the maximum possible energy of solar flares of the\npresent-day Sun, if any, is thus a key question in heliophysics. The largest\nsolar flares observed over the past few decades have reached energies of a few\ntimes 10^{32} ergs, possibly up to 10^{33} ergs. Flares in active Sun-like\nstars reach up to about 10^{36} ergs. In the absence of direct observations of\nsolar flares within this range, complementary methods of investigation are\nneeded. Using historical reports for solar active region, we scaled to observed\nsolar values a realistic dimensionless 3D MHD simulation for eruptive flares,\nwhich originate from a highly sheared bipole. This enabled us to calculate the\nmagnetic fluxes and flare energies in the model in a wide paramater space.\nFirstly, commonly observed solar conditions lead to modeled magnetic fluxes and\nflare energies that are comparable to those estimated from observations.\nSecondly, we evaluate from observations that 30% of the area of sunspot groups\nare typically involved in flares. This is related to the strong fragmentation\nof these groups, which naturally results from sub-photospheric convection. When\nthe model is scaled to 30% of the area of the largest sunspot group ever\nreported, with its peak magnetic field being set to the strongest value ever\nmeasured in a sunspot, it produces a flare with a maximum energy of ~ 6x10^{33}\nergs. The results of the model suggest that the Sun is able to produce flares\nup to about six times as energetic in total solar irradiance fluence as the\nstrongest directly-observed flare from Nov 4, 2003. Sunspot groups larger than\nhistorically reported would yield superflares for spot pairs that would exceed\ntens of degrees in extent. We thus conjecture that superflare-productive\nSun-like stars should have a much stronger dynamo than in the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 15:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The problem is to determine the number of radio nodes that can\ntransmit simultaneously while still achieving their SINR requirements and then\ndecide which channels these nodes should transmit on. Previous work have shown\nhow this can be done for a large spectrum pool where nodes allocate multiple\nchannels from that pool which renders a linear programming approach feasible\nwhen the pool is large enough. In this paper we extend their work by\nconsidering arbitrary individual pool sizes and allow nodes to only transmit on\none channel. Due to the accumulative nature of interference this problem is a\nnon-convex integer problem which is NP-hard.

At\npresent, two main techniques are being used: Cryptography and Steganography. In\neffect, cryptography garbles a secret message turning it into a meaningless\nform; while, steganography hides the very existence of the message by embedding\nit into an intermediate such as a computer file. In fact, in audio\nsteganography, this computer file is a digital audio file in which secret data\nare concealed, predominantly, into the bits that make up its audio samples.\nThis paper proposes a novel steganography technique for hiding digital data\ninto uncompressed audio files using a randomized algorithm and a context-free\ngrammar coupled with a lexicon of words. Furthermore, the proposed technique\nuses two intermediates to transmit the secret data between communicating\nparties: The first intermediate is an audio file whose audio samples, which are\nselected randomly, are used to conceal the secret data; whereas, the second\nintermediate is a grammatically correct English text that is generated at\nruntime using a context-free grammar and it encodes the location of the random\naudio samples in the audio file. The proposed technique is stealthy and\nirrecoverable in a sense that it is difficult for unauthorized third parties to\ndetect the presence of and recover the secret data. Experiments conducted\nshowed how the covering and the uncovering processes of the proposed technique\nwork. As future work, a semantic analyzer is to be developed so as to make the\nintermediate text not only grammatically correct but also semantically\nplausible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 14:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}

From\nthese geometrically based quantities one obtains the behavior of our universe.\nThe Weyl connection vector \\w existing in microcells creates dark matter\nparticles, weylons. In the very early universe \\beta creates matter, whereas in\nthe present dust period \\beta forms dark energy, the latter causing cosmic\nacceleration. Around a massive body the - dark energy form a ball-like\nconcentration having negative mass and negative pressure. These \\beta-balls\ncause an additional acceleration of the expanding universe.

The scale is variable depending on the gravitational\npotential and the trajectory inclination with respect to the field direction.\nThe proposed neutrino covariant equation provides the adequate curvature. The\nmass-energy at the Earth surface varies from a horizontal value 0.402 eV to a\nvertical value 0.569 eV. Earth spinor waves with winding numbers n show squared\nenergy differences within ranges from 2.05 x 10*(-3) to 4.10 x 10*(-3) eV*2 for\nn=0,1 neutrinos and from 3.89 x 10*(-5) to 7.79 x 10*(-5) eV*2 for n=1,2\nneutrinos. These waves interfere and the different phase velocities produce\nneutrino-like oscillations. The experimental results for atmospheric and solar\nneutrino oscillation mass parameters respectivelly fall within these\ntheoretical ranges. Neutrinos in outer space, where interactions may be\nneglected, appear as particles travelling with zero mass on null geodesics.\nThese gravitational curvature energies are consistent with neutrino\noscillations, zero neutrino rest masses and Einstein's General Relativity and\nenergy mass equivalence principle.
