Here we report the\ninteresting result that when these discrete components are identified and\nremoved from the radial velocities of the SNeIa galaxies studied in the Hubble\nKey Project, there is evidence for a residual oscillation, or ripple,\nsuperimposed on the Hubble flow. This oscillation has a wavelength near 40 Mpc\nand, because its amplitude is small compared to that of the scatter in\nvelocities, it becomes visible only after the discrete components are removed.\nThis result is interesting because even if this ripple has been produced by a\nselection effect, the fact that it is only revealed after the discrete\nvelocities are removed implies that the discrete velocities are real.\nAlternatively, if no selection effect can be identified to explain the ripple,\nthen both the discrete velocities and the ripple together become very difficult\nto explain by chance and these results could then have interesting cosmological\nconsequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 17:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-14"}

Such a feature\nis useful when the cause of a bug is close in time to the bug manifestation.\nWhen the cause is far back in time, one resorts to setting appropriate\nbreakpoints in the debugger and beginning a new debugging session. For these\ncases when the cause of a bug is far in time from its manifestation, bug\ndiagnosis requires a series of debugging sessions with which to narrow down the\ncause of the bug.\n  For such \"difficult\" bugs, this work presents an automated tool to search\nthrough the process lifetime and locate the cause. As an example, the bug could\nbe related to a program invariant failing. A binary search through the process\nlifetime suffices, since the invariant expression is true at the beginning of\nthe program execution, and false when the bug is encountered. An algorithm for\nsuch a binary search is presented within the FReD (Fast Reversible Debugger)\nsoftware. It is based on the ability to checkpoint, restart and\ndeterministically replay the multiple processes of a debugging session. It is\nbased on GDB (a debugger), DMTCP (for checkpoint-restart), and a custom\ndeterministic record-replay plugin for DMTCP.\n  FReD supports complex, real-world multithreaded programs, such as MySQL and\nFirefox. Further, the binary search is robust. It operates on multi-threaded\nprograms, and takes advantage of multi-core architectures during replay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 19:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}

This approach is based on recent deep results in combinatorial group\ntheory. It applies to both regular and irregular random graphs.\n  Let G be a random d-regular graph on n vertices, and let \\lambda be the\nlargest absolute value of a non-trivial eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. It\nwas conjectured by Alon [86'] that a random d-regular graph is almost\nRamanujan, in the following sense: for every e>0, \\lambda<2\\sqrt{d-1} + e\nasymptotically almost surely. Friedman famously presented a proof of this\nconjecture in [08']. Here we suggest a new, substantially simpler proof of a\nnearly-optimal result: we show that a random d-regular graph satisfies \\lambda\n< 2\\sqrt{d-1} + 1 a.a.s.\n  A main advantage of our approach is that it is applicable to a generalized\nconjecture: For d even, a d-regular graph on n vertices is an n-covering space\nof a bouquet of d/2 loops.

The smaller size of\nan IMBH compared to a supermassive black hole and a smaller tidal radius of a\nWD disruption lead to a very fast event with high peak luminosity. Magnetic\nfield is generated in situ following the tidal disruption, which leads to\neffective accretion. Since large-scale magnetic field is also produced,\ngeometrically thick super-Eddington inflow leads to a relativistic jet. The\ndense jet possesses a photosphere, which emits quasi-thermal radiation in soft\nX-rays. The source can be classified as a long low-luminosity gamma-ray burst\n(ll-GRB). Tidal compression of a WD causes nuclear ignition, which is\nobservable as an accompanying supernova. We suggest that GRB060218 and SN2006aj\nis such a pair of ll-GRB and supernova.

We show\nthat PNe can also be found in the presence of emission from diffuse gas and\nfurther illustrate the excellent sensitivity of IFS in detecting extragalactic\nPNe through a comparison with narrowband images obtained with the Hubble Space\nTelescope. We find the nuclear PNe population of M31 is only marginally\nconsistent with the generally adopted form of the PNe luminosity function\n(PNLF). In particular, this is due to a lack of PNe with absolute magnitude\nM5007 brighter than -3, which would only result from a rather unfortunate draw\nfrom such a model PNLF. We suggest that the observed lack of bright PNe in the\nnuclear regions of M31 is due to a horizontal-branch population that is more\ntilted toward less massive and hotter He-burning stars, so that its progeny\nconsists mostly of UV-bright stars that fail to climb back up the asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) and only of few, if any, bright PNe powered by central\npost-AGB stars. These results are also consistent with recent reports on a\ndearth of bright post-AGB stars towards the nucleus of M31, and lend further\nsupport to the idea that the metallicity of a stellar population has an impact\non the way the horizontal branch is populated and to the loose anticorrelation\nbetween the strength of the UV-upturn and the specific number of PNe that is\nobserved in early-type galaxies. Finally, our investigation also serves to\nstress the importance of considering the same spatial scales when comparing the\nPNe population of galaxies with the properties of their stellar populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 06:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We\nhave assembled a sample of 277 galaxies with a high quality spectroscopic\nredshift at 2<z<4.6 from the VVDS survey, and we have identified 39 HeII1640A\nemitters. We study their spectral properties, measuring the fluxes, equivalent\nwidths (EW) and FWHM for most relevant lines. About 10% of galaxies at z~3 show\nHeII in emission, with rest frame equivalent widths EW0~1-7A, equally\ndistributed between galaxies with Lya in emission or in absorption. We find 11\nhigh-quality HeII emitters with unresolved HeII line (FWHM_0<1200km/s), 13\nhigh-quality emitters with broad He II emission (FWHM_0>1200km/s), 3 AGN, and\nan additional 12 possible HeII emitters. The properties of the individual broad\nemitters are in agreement with expectations from a W-R model. On the contrary,\nthe properties of the narrow emitters are not compatible with such model,\nneither with predictions of gravitational cooling radiation produced by gas\naccretion. Rather, we find that the EW of the narrow HeII line emitters are in\nagreement with expectations for a PopIII star formation, if the episode of star\nformation is continuous, and we calculate that a PopIII SFR of 0.1-10 Mo yr-1\nonly is enough to sustain the observed HeII flux. We conclude that narrow HeII\nemitters are either powered by the ionizing flux from a stellar population rare\nat z~0 but much more common at z~3, or by PopIII star formation. As proposed by\nTornatore et al. (2007), incomplete ISM mixing may leave some small pockets of\npristine gas at the periphery of galaxies from which PopIII may form, even down\nto z~2 or lower.

Our approach\nis founded on some basic observations allowing us to consider void\nprobabilities and moment measures as two complementary tools for capturing\nclustering phenomena in point processes. As might be expected, smaller values\nof these characteristics indicate less clustering. Also, various global and\nlocal functionals of random geometric models driven by point processes admit\nmore or less explicit bounds involving void probabilities and moment measures,\nthus aiding the study of impact of clustering of the underlying point process.\nWhen stronger tools are needed, directional convex ordering of point processes\nhappens to be an appropriate choice, as well as the notion of (positive or\nnegative) association, when comparison to the Poisson point process is\nconsidered. We explain the relations between these tools and provide examples\nof point processes admitting them. Furthermore, we sketch some recent results\nobtained using the aforementioned comparison tools, regarding percolation and\ncoverage properties of the Boolean model, the SINR model, subgraph counts in\nrandom geometric graphs, and more generally, U-statistics of point processes.\nWe also mention some results on Betti numbers for \\v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips\nrandom complexes generated by stationary point processes.

The governing integral\nequation for mass distribution, resulting from the balance between the\nNewtonian gravitational force and centrifugal force due to rotation at every\npoint on the disk, is transformed via a boundary-element method into a linear\nalgebra matrix equation that can be solved numerically for rotation curves with\na wide range of shapes. To illustrate the effectiveness of this computational\nmethod, mass distributions in several mature spiral galaxies are determined\nfrom their measured rotation curves. All the surface mass density profiles\npredicted by our model exhibit approximately a common exponential law of decay,\nqualitatively consistent with the observed surface brightness distributions.\nWhen a central spherical bulge is present, the total galactic mass increases\nonly slightly but the mass distribution in the galaxy is altered in such a way\nthat the periphery mass density is reduced while more mass appears toward the\ngalactic center. By extending the computational domain beyond the galactic\nedge, we can determine rotation velocity outside the cut-off radius which\nappears to continuously decrease and gradually approach the Keplerian rotation\nvelocity out over twice the cut-off radius. Am examination of the circular\norbit stability suggests that galaxies with flat or increasing rotation\nvelocities with radius are more stable than those with decreasing rotation\nvelocities especially in the region near the galactic edge.

The striped phase breaks a Z4\nsymmetry and is stabilized at low temperatures for g=J2/|J1|>1/2. Despite the\nsimplicity of the model, it has proved difficult to precisely determine the\norder and the universality class of the phase transitions. This was done\nconvincingly only recently by Jin et al. [PRL 108, 045702 (2012)]. Here, we\nfurther elucidate the nature of these transitions and their anomalies by\nemploying a combination of cluster mean-field theory, Monte Carlo simulations,\nand transfer-matrix calculations. The J1-J2 model has a line of very weak\nfirst-order phase transitions in the whole region 1/2<g<g*, where g* = 0.67(1).\nThereafter, the transitions from g above g* are continuous and can be fully\nmapped, using universality arguments, to the critical line of the well known\nAshkin-Teller model from its 4-state Potts point to the decoupled Ising limit.\nWe also comment on the pseudo-first-order behavior at the Potts point and its\nneighborhood in the Ashkin-Teller model on finite lattices, which in turn leads\nto the appearance of similar effects in the vicinity of the multicritical point\ng* in the J1-J2 model. The continuous transitions near g* can therefore be\nmistaken to be first-order transitions, and this realization was the key to\nunderstanding the paramagnetic-striped transition for the full range of g>1/2.\nMost of our results are based on Monte Carlo calculations, while the cluster\nmean-field and transfer-matrix results provide useful methodological\nbench-marks for weakly first-order behaviors and Ashkin-Teller criticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 05:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-19"}

One characteristic of\nthis formulation is that the observables of position and momentum are truly\ntreated equally so that an intrinsic phase-space approach seems a natural\ncourse to be taken. In fact, we may distinguish at least two different quantum\nmechanical approaches to the structure of the quantum phase space: The\nWeyl-Wigner (WW) formalism and the advent of the theory of Coherent States\n(CS). The Weyl-Wigner formalism has had many applications ranging from the\ndiscussion of the Classical/Quantum Mechanical transition and quantum chaos to\nsignal analysis[3,4]. The Coherent State formalism had a profound impact on\nQuantum Optics and during the course of time has found applications in diverse\nareas such as geometric quantization, wavelet and harmonic analysis [5].

The high angular resolution of the T-ReCs spectra allows us to\nprobe physical regions of 57 pc (median).

To realize its potential, communication protocols need to\nbe redesigned to combat the randomness of the harvested energy. In this paper,\nwe investigate how to apply relaying to improve the short-term performance of\nEH communication systems. With an EH source and a non-EH half-duplex relay, we\nconsider two different design objectives: 1) short-term throughput\nmaximization; and 2) transmission completion time minimization. Both problems\nare joint scheduling and power allocation problems, rendered quite challenging\nby the half-duplex constraint at the relay. A key finding is that directional\nwater-filling (DWF), which is the optimal power allocation algorithm for the\nsingle-hop EH system, can serve as guideline for the design of two-hop\ncommunication systems, as it not only determines the value of the optimal\nperformance, but also forms the basis to derive optimal solutions for both\ndesign problems. Based on a relaxed energy profile along with the DWF\nalgorithm, we derive key properties of the optimal solutions for both problems\nand thereafter propose efficient algorithms. Simulation results will show that\nboth scheduling and power allocation optimizations are necessary in two-hop EH\ncommunication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 11:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Hitherto, research of natural HGT\nhas mainly focused on three mechanisms: conjugation, natural competence, and\nviral transduction. This paper discusses the feasibility of a fourth such\nmechanism - cell electroporation and/or electrofusion triggered by atmospheric\nelectrostatic discharges (lightnings). A description of electroporation as a\nphenomenon is followed by a review of experimental evidence that\nelectroporation of prokaryotes in aqueous environments can result in release of\nnon-denatured DNA, as well as uptake of DNA from the surroundings and\ntransformation. Similarly, a description of electrofusion is followed by a\nreview of experiments showing that prokaryotes devoid of cell wall can\nelectrofuse into hybrids expressing the genes of their both precursors. Under\nsufficiently fine-tuned conditions, electroporation and electrofusion are\nefficient tools for artificial transformation and hybridization, respectively,\nbut the quantitative analysis developed here shows that conditions for\nelectroporation-based DNA release, DNA uptake and transformation, as well as\nfor electrofusion are also present in many natural aqueous environments exposed\nto lightnings. Electroporation is thus a plausible contributor to natural HGT\namong prokaryotes, and could have been particularly important during the early\nevolution, when the other mechanisms might have been scarcer or nonexistent. In\nmodern prokaryotes, natural absence of the cell wall is rare, but it is\nreasonable to assume that the wall has formed during evolution, and at least\nprior to this, electrofusion could also have contributed to HGT. The concluding\nsection outlines several guidelines for assessment of the feasibility of\nlightning-triggered HGT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 13:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Following the suggestion that\nfree precession of the neutron star may be responsible for the variation in the\npulse profiles, we developed a physical model of strong feedback interaction\nbetween the neutron star and the accretion disk in order to explain the\nseemingly identical values for the periods of the two types of variations,\nwhich were found to be in basic synchronization.

The p-relation\nfinally adopted is 1.50 -0.24log P. The slope of this relation is based on the\ncondition that the distance to the LMC does not depend on period or (V-K)\ncolour and that the slope of the PL relation based on the BW distances agrees\nwith that based on apparent magnitude. The zero point of the relation is tight\nto the Cepheids with HST and revised Hipparcos parallaxes as well as to\nCepheids in clusters. The slope of the Galactic and LMC K-band relation\nformally agrees within the errors, and combining all Cepheids (including the\nSMC) results in a negligible metallicity dependence. A similar conclusion is\nfound for the reddening-free Wesenheit relation. In the V-band the situation is\nmore complex. The slope of the LMC and the Galactic PL relation differ at the\n3sigma level. Combining the sample nevertheless results in a metallicity term\nsignificant at the 2sigma level. The details of the comparison of BW-based\ndistances and Cepheids with HST and revised Hipparcos parallaxes also play a\nrole. The method used by Storm et al. would lead to larger DM of 18.37 and\n18.81 for the LMC and SMC, respectively. The LMC DM is shorter than the\ncurrently accepted value, which is in the range 18.42 to 18.55 (Walker 2012),\nand it is speculated that the p-factor may depend on metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 15:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

For bounded-size rules, all components of size greater than some\nfixed $K\\geq 1$ are accorded the same treatment.

Three related\nmodels are examined and compared: (a) a uniform elastic beam on a distributed\nelastic foundation, (b) an elastic beam which mass is concentrated at a\ndiscrete set of points corresponding to the discrete set of the elastic\nsupports and (c) a uniform elastic beam on a set of discrete elastic supports.\nStiffness of the support is assumed to drop when the stress reaches a critical\nvalue.

One of the standard models are the Achlioptas random graph processes\non a fixed set of $n$ vertices. Here at each step, one chooses two edges\nuniformly at random and then decides which one to add to the existing\nconfiguration according to some criterion. An important class of such rules are\nthe bounded-size rules where for a fixed $K\\geq 1$, all components of size\ngreater than $K$ are treated equally. While a great deal of work has gone into\nanalyzing the subcritical and supercritical regimes, the nature of the critical\nscaling window, the size and complexity (deviation from trees) of the\ncomponents in the critical regime and nature of the merging dynamics has not\nbeen well understood.

They generalize and subsume earlier results that were\nobtained for specific values of the weights.\n  One advantage of our generality is that we may let the weights approach\nextreme values of zero or infinity which covers further special cases appearing\nearlier in the literature. Furthermore, our generality allows us to analyze the\nstructure of random staircase tableaux and we obtain several results in this\ndirection.\n  One of the tools we use are generating functions of the parameters of\ninterests. This leads us to a two--parameter family of polynomials and we study\nthis family as well. Specific values of the parameters include number of\nspecial cases analyzed earlier in the literature. All of them are\ngeneralizations of the classical Eulerian polynomials.\n  We also briefly discuss the relation of staircase tableaux to the asymmetric\nexclusion process, to other recently introduced types of tableaux, and to an\nurn model studied by a number of researchers, including Philippe Flajolet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 15:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

We consider here a KS model of\nthe Bubble Universe -- a semi-closed Universe with a rotating de Sitter (or\nanti-de Sitter) space embedded in an external flat space-time. When the\nsolution has two horizons, it may also be interpreted as an Universe inside a\nblack hole. In micro-world the KS geometry yields a model of the spinning\nparticle consistent with gravity and describes a pre-quantum twistorial\nstructure of space-time with the beam-like fluctuations of metric consistent\nwith the beamlike fluctuations of electromagnetic vacuum. These light-like\ntwistor-beam excitations are consistent with gravity and generalize the known\npp-wave solutions.
