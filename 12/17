One way to try and prevent the tragedy\nof the commons is through infliction of punishment for over-consumption and/or\nencouraging under-consumption, thus selecting against over-consumers. Here, the\neffectiveness of various punishment functions in an evolving consumer-resource\nsystem is evaluated within a framework of a parametrically heterogeneous system\nof ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Conditions leading to the\npossibility of sustainable coexistence with the common resource for a subset of\ncases are identified analytically using adaptive dynamics; the effects of\npunishment on heterogeneous populations with different initial composition are\nevaluated using the Reduction theorem for replicator equations. Obtained\nresults suggest that one cannot prevent the tragedy of the commons through\nrewarding of under-consumers alone - there must also be an implementation of\nsome degree of punishment that increases in a non-linear fashion with respect\nto over-consumption and which may vary depending on the initial distribution of\nclones in the population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Dec 2012 17:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

The long domain is needed in order to\naccommodate the multiple reconnections, which enhance vortex stretching rates\nand the generation of small-scale vortex structures within the vortex rings. In\naddition to making the initial vortices very long, new features introduced with\nthis initial condition are an initial profile less likely to shed vortex sheets\nand an improved method for mapping the direction of the vorticity onto the\nthree-dimensional mesh. To get to the turbulent state, the vortices progress\nthrough the following steps: First, until the first reconnection, the vortex\ndynamics is largely consistent with existing work on strong, possibly singular,\ngrowth of the vorticity in the Euler equations. Second, vortex reconnection at\nthe junction of the primary symmetry planes meet. About half of the circulation\nfrom each vortex reconnects into two \"bridges\", leaving behind two \"threads\",\nwith the bridges and threads arranged into 4 orthogonal pairs. In the third\nstep, stretching is induced by new anti-parallel attractions due to the\ntwisting that forms along the reconnected vortices. This extra stretching then\npulls on the threads as they wind around the bridges, resulting in spirals over\nthe entire vortices. In the fourth step, multiple vortex rings form through\nmultiple reconnections, with each ring consisting of spiral vortices. A\n$k^{-5/3}$ energy spectra begins to form after the first ring separates and\neventually covers one decade. It is argued that the spirals are the source of\nthe $k^{-5/3}$ spectra that develops.

Still, there are few tools that perform automated\nextraction of UCs for LTL. Existing tools compute a UC as an unsatisfiable\nsubset of the set of top-level conjuncts of an LTL formula. Using resolution\ngraphs to extract UCs is common in other domains such as SAT. In this article\nwe construct and optimize resolution graphs for temporal resolution as\nimplemented in the temporal resolution-based solver TRP++, and we use them to\nextract UCs for propositional LTL. The resulting UCs are more fine-grained than\nthe UCs obtained from existing tools because UC extraction also simplifies\ntop-level conjuncts instead of treating them as atomic entities. For example,\ngiven an unsatisfiable LTL formula of the form $\\phi \\equiv ({\\bf G} \\psi)\n\\wedge {\\bf F} \\psi'$ existing tools return $\\phi$ as a UC irrespective of the\ncomplexity of $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$, whereas the approach presented in this\narticle continues to remove parts not required for unsatisfiability inside\n$\\psi$ and $\\psi'$. Our approach also identifies groups of occurrences of a\nproposition that do not interact in a proof of unsatisfiability. We implement\nour approach in TRP++. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach (i) extracts UCs that are often significantly smaller than the input\nformula with an acceptable overhead and (ii) produces more fine-grained UCs\nthan competing tools while remaining at least competitive in terms of run time\nand memory usage.

The two principal improvements are (1)\ndeveloping a model for the density and velocity structure of a disk wind that\nfills the bipolar outflow cavities; and (2) solving for the radially varying\naccretion rate in the disk due to a supply of mass and angular momentum from\nthe infall envelope and their loss to the disk wind. One consequence of the\nlaunching of the disk wind is a reduction in the amount of accretion power that\nis radiated by the disk. For the transition from dusty to dust-free conditions\nwhere gas opacities dominate, we now implement a gradual change as a more\nrealistic approximation of dust destruction. We study how the above effects,\nespecially the outflow, influence the SEDs and the images of the protostar.\nDust in the outflow cavity significantly affects the SEDs at most viewing\nangles. It further attenuates the short-wavelength flux from the protostar,\ncontrolling how the accretion disk may be viewed, and contributes a significant\npart of the near- and mid-IR fluxes. These fluxes warm the disk, boosting the\nmid- and far-IR emission. We find that for near face-on views, the SED from the\nnear-IR to about 60 micron is very flat, which may be used to identify such\nsystems. We show that the near-facing outflow cavity and its walls are still\nthe most significant features in images up to 70 micron, dominating the mid-IR\nemission and determining its morphology. The thermal emission from the dusty\noutflow itself dominates the flux at ~20 micron. The detailed distribution of\nthe dust in the outflow affects the morphology, for example, even though the\noutflow cavity is wide, at 10 to 20 micron, the dust in the disk wind can make\nthe outflow appear narrower than in the near-IR bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 06:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 22:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The transmitter uses a set of N\nSpace-Time Block Codes (STBCs), one corresponding to each of the N possible\nfeedback values, to encode and transmit information. The feedback function used\nat the receiver and the N component STBCs used at the transmitter together\nconstitute a Finite Feedback Scheme (FFS). Although a number of FFSs are\navailable in the literature that provably achieve full-diversity, there is no\nknown universal criterion to determine whether a given arbitrary FFS achieves\nfull-diversity or not. Further, all known full-diversity FFSs for T<N_t where\nN_t is the number of transmit antennas, have rate at the most 1. In this paper\na universal necessary condition for any FFS to achieve full-diversity is given,\nusing which the notion of Feedback-Transmission duration optimal (FT-Optimal)\nFFSs - schemes that use minimum amount of feedback N given the transmission\nduration T, and minimum transmission duration given the amount of feedback to\nachieve full-diversity - is introduced. When there is no feedback (N=1) an\nFT-optimal scheme consists of a single STBC with T=N_t, and the universal\nnecessary condition reduces to the well known necessary and sufficient\ncondition for an STBC to achieve full-diversity: every non-zero codeword\ndifference matrix of the STBC must be of rank N_t. Also, a sufficient condition\nfor full-diversity is given for the FFSs in which the component STBC with the\nlargest minimum Euclidean distance is chosen. Using this sufficient condition\nfull-rate (rate N_t) full-diversity FT-Optimal schemes are constructed for all\n(N_t,T,N) with NT=N_t. These are the first full-rate full-diversity FFSs\nreported in the literature for T<N_t.

This paper focuses\non the low frequency shot noise which arises when the pulse excitations are\npartitioned by a single scatterer in the framework of the Photo Assisted Shot\nNoise (PASN) theory. As a unique tool to count the number of excitations\ncarried per pulse, shot noise reveals that pulses of arbitrary shape and\narbitrary charge show a marked minimum when the charge is integer. Shot noise\nspectroscopy is also considered to perform energy-domain characterization of\nthe charge pulses. In particular it reveals the striking asymmetrical spectrum\nof Lorentzian pulses. Finally, time-domain information is obtained from Hong Ou\nMandel like noise correlations when two trains of pulses generated on opposite\ncontacts collide on the scatterer. As a function of the time delay between\npulse trains, the noise is shown to measure the electron wavepacket\nautocorrelation function for integer Lorentzian thanks to electron\nantibunching.

A specifically tailored Uppsala model based on the MARCS\ncode and extending further in wavelength is used to gauge the emission\ncharacteristics of alpha Cen A in the FIR.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a temperature minimum\nhas been directly measured on a main-sequence star other than the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 10:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Additionally, in C-burning conditions a high 12C+12C rate\nmay lead to lower central C-burning temperatures and to 13C(alpha,n)16O\nemerging as a more dominant neutron source than 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg, increasing\nsignificantly the s-process production. This is due to the rapid decrease of\nthe 13N(gamma,p)12C with decreasing temperature, causing the 13C production via\n13N(beta+)13C. Presented here is the impact of the 12C+12C reaction\nuncertainties on the s-process and on explosive p-process nucleosynthesis in\nmassive stars, including also fast rotating massive stars at low metallicity.\nUsing various 12C+12C rates, in particular an upper and lower rate limit of ~\n50000 higher and ~ 20 lower than the standard rate at 5*10^8 K, five 25 Msun\nstellar models are calculated. The enhanced s-process signature due to\n13C(alpha,n)16O activation is considered, taking into account the impact of the\nuncertainty of all three C-burning reaction branches.

An answer is\nto enhance the information sharing between the stakeholders. This paper\nintroduces a framework that bridges the gap between air traffic management and\nair traffic control on the one hand, and bridges the gap between the ground,\nthe approach and the en-route centers on the other hand. An original system is\npresented, that has three essential components: the trajectory models, the\noptimization process, and the monitoring process. The uncertainty of the\ntrajectory is modeled with a Bayesian Network, where the nodes are associated\nto two types of random variables: the time of overflight on metering points of\nthe airspace, and the traveling time of the routes linking these points. The\nresulting Bayesian Network covers the complete airspace, and Monte- Carlo\nsimulations are done to estimate the probabilities of sector congestion and\ndelays. On top of this trajectory model, an optimization process minimizes\nthese probabilities by tuning the parameters of the Bayesian trajectory model\nrelated to overflight times on metering points. The last component is the\nmonitoring process, that continuously updates the situation of the airspace,\nmodifying the trajectories uncertainties according to actual positions of\naircraft. After each update, a new optimal set of overflight times is computed,\nand can be communicated to the controllers as clearances for the aircraft\npilots. The paper presents a formal specification of this global optimization\nproblem, whose underlying rationale was derived with the help of air traffic\ncontrollers at Thales Air Systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 14:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

More than 80 % of eruptions lead to a CME. This correlation\nhas been studied extensively during the past solar cycles and the last long\nsolar minimum. The statistics made on events occurring during the rising phase\nof the new solar cycle 24 is in agreement with this finding. Both filaments and\nCMEs have been related to twisted magnetic fields. Therefore, nearly all the\nMHD CME models include a twisted flux tube, called a flux rope. Either the flux\nrope is present long before the eruption, or it is built up by reconnection of\na sheared arcade from the beginning of the eruption. In order to initiate\neruptions, different mechanisms have been proposed: new emergence of flux,\nand/or dispersion of the external magnetic field, and/or reconnection of field\nlines below or above the flux rope. These mechanisms reduce the downward\nmagnetic tension and favor the rise of the flux rope. Another mechanism is the\nkink instability when the configuration is twisted too much. In this paper we\nopen a forum of discussions revisiting observational and theoretical papers to\nunderstand which mechanisms trigger the eruption. We conclude that all the\nabove quoted mechanisms could bring the flux rope to an unstable state.\nHowever, the most efficient mechanism for CMEs is the loss-of-equilibrium or\ntorus instability, when the flux rope has reached an unstable threshold\ndetermined by a decay index of the external magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 14:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We present a stand-alone software (named EXSdetect) for the detection\nof extended sources in X-ray images. Our goal is to provide a flexible tool\ncapable of detecting extended sources down to the lowest flux levels attainable\nwithin instrumental limitations, while maintaining robust photometry, high\ncompleteness, and low contamination, regardless of source morphology. EXSdetect\nwas developed mainly to exploit the ever-increasing wealth of archival X-ray\ndata, but is also ideally suited to explore the scientific capabilities of\nfuture X-ray facilities, with a strong focus on investigations of distant\ngroups and clusters of galaxies. Methods. EXSdetect combines a fast Voronoi\ntessellation code with a friends-of-friends algorithm and an automated\ndeblending procedure. The values of key parameters are matched to fundamental\ntelescope properties such as angular resolution and instrumental background. In\naddition, the software is designed to permit extensive tests of its performance\nvia simulations of a wide range of observational scenarios. Results. We applied\nEXSdetect to simulated data fields modeled to realistically represent the Swift\nX-ray Cluster Survey (SXCS), which is based on archival data obtained by the\nX-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite. We achieve more than 90%\ncompleteness for extended sources comprising at least 80 photons in the 0.5-2\nkeV band, a limit that corresponds to 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the deepest\nSXCS fields. This detection limit is comparable to the one attained by the most\nsensitive cluster surveys conducted with much larger X-ray telescopes. While\nevaluating the performance of EXSdetect, we also explored the impact of\nimproved angular resolution and discuss the ideal properties of the next\ngeneration of X-ray survey missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 15:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

To be submitted for publication","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.CR","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  When I was smaller, a five megabyte fixed disk cost $5,000, a 300 bps modem\ncost hundreds of dollars, and communication links were intercepted by attaching\ndevices to the target subscriber's local loop. From then to now there have been\nthree great implosions: the cost of storage, the cost of bandwidth, and the\ncost of surveillance. The wake of the first two implosions sheared away most\nobstacles to using one-time pads to encrypt data in flight, and the final\nimposition -- I mean implosion -- now makes consideration of one-time pads a\npractical necessity.\n  So far as assurance of confidentiality is concerned, today's block ciphers\nand public key cryptosystems flunk the exam. I don't know how to recover an AES\nkey or compute the discrete logarithm of an elliptic curve element, but there\nexists no proof that another cannot. Moreover, encrypted communications can be\nrecorded and stored for later attack by algorithms and devices yet to be\ndiscovered. Equally concerning is that when a significant \"break\" is discovered\nfor solving either puzzle, the safety of an entire planet's communication and\ndata dissolves like instant pudding.\n  The world is unready to ingest so much pudding. We need balance in our\ncryptographic diet, and we need that balance now. In this paper, I discredit\nmany myths concerning one-time pads, discuss practical steps to address\nperceived shortcomings, and shatter the notion that secure generation,\ndistribution, and use of mammoth cryptographic keys cannot be practiced in\nevery home, church, school, and business. I also discuss my own\nimplementations, their capabilities and track record, and where they should\nlead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 04:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}

Experimental readings were obtained using the\nbiodiesel prepared form the waste low quality cooking oil collected from the\ncanteen of Sri Sairam Engineering College, India.. This waste cooking oil was\ndue to the preparation of varieties of food (vegetables fried and non\nvegetarian). Over more than a week, trans esterification was done in chemical\nlab and the biodiesel was obtained. The biodiesel was mixed in proportions of\n10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% with remaining combinations of the diesel supplied by\nthe Indian government. Variable compression ratio (VCR) diesel engine with\nsingle cylinder, four stroke diesel type was used. The outputs of the engine as\npower, torque and specific fuel consumption were obtained from the\ncomputational facility attached to the engine. The data collected for different\ninput conditions of the engine was further used to train (PVBPA). The trained\nPVBPA network was further used to predict the power, torque and brake specific\nfuel consumption (SFC) for different speed, biodiesel and diesel combinations\nand full load condition. The estimation performance of the PVBPA network is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 02:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}
