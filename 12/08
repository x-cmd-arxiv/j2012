Our goal is to design practical scheduling\npolicies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput\nand delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$-complexity\nhybrid scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee both\nrate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic\nregime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting),\ntheir practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop\na simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a\n\\lower complexity $2n^2+2n$, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves\nthroughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay\nperformance. Specifically, we show that the rate-function attained by D-SSG for\nany delay-violation threshold $b$, is no smaller than the maximum achievable\nrate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold $b-1$. Thus, we are able\nto achieve a reduction in complexity (from $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$ of the hybrid\npolicies to $2n^2 + 2n$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More\nimportantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity\nthan the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in\nthe $O(\\cdot)$ notation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to validate\nour theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that\nD-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically is\nvirtually indistinguishable from delay-optimal policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 16:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Mar 2013 21:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 09:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 2014 17:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-25"}

Sudoku puzzles provide a very rare\nexample of a class of frustrated systems with a unique groundstate without\nsymmetry. Here, the puzzle is recast as thermodynamic system where the number\nof violated rules defines the energy. We use Monte Carlo simulation to show\nthat the \"Sudoku Hamiltonian\" exhibits two transitions as a function of\ntemperature, a paramagnetic and a glass transition. Of these, the intermediate\ncondensed phase is the only one which visits the ground state (i.e. it solves\nthe puzzle, though this is not the purpose of the study). Both transitions are\nassociated with an entropy change, paramagnetism measured from the dynamics of\nthe Monte Carlo run, showing a peak in specific heat, while the residual glass\nentropy is determined by finding multiple instances of the glass by repeated\nannealing. There are relatively few such simple models for frustrated or glassy\nsystems which exhibit both ordering and glass transitions, sudoku puzzles are\nunique for the ease with which they can be obtained with the proof of the\nexistence of a unique ground state via the satisfiability of all constraints.\nSimulations suggest that in the glass phase there is an increase in information\nentropy with lowering temperature.

The disturbance to the electronic structure is confined within a few\natomic layers of the interface. The interfacial bonding is mainly ionic, and\nsurprisingly there is more charge transfer from Ti to O in the interface than\nin the bulk. In consequence the Ti/TiO$_2$ interface has stronger binding than\nthe bulk of either material. This helps to explain why the oxide forms a\nstable, protective layer on Ti and Ti alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 17:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-10"}

The derivation and computation of the\nfree energy distance are also straightforward.

Here, using a\ncoarse-grained (CG) off-lattice model, we carry out a comparative analysis of\nthe thermodynamic aspects characterizing the folding transition with respect to\nthe propensity for aggregation of four different systems: two isoforms of the\namyloid $\\beta$-protein, the Src SH3 domain, and the human prion proteins\n(hPrP). Microcanonical analysis of the data obtained from replica exchange\nmethod (REM) is conducted to evaluate the free-energy barrier and latent heat\nin these models.

The CG simulation of\nthe hPrP heteropolymer yielded a continuous folding transition. The absence of\na free-energy barrier and latent heat favors the presence of partially unfolded\nconformations, and in this context, this thermodynamic aspect could explain the\nreason why the hPrP heteropolymer is more aggregation-prone than the other\nheteropolymers considered in this study.

[In Applied Stochastic Analysis\n(1991) 121-156 Gordon & Breach] diffusion (BKR diffusion), neither of which\nstarts at the origin, and whose natural filtrations agree. The paper commences\nby surveying probabilistic coupling, introducing the formal definition of an\nimmersed coupling (the natural filtration of each component is immersed in a\ncommon underlying filtration; such couplings have been described as co-adapted\nor Markovian in older terminologies) and of an equi-filtration coupling (the\nnatural filtration of each component is immersed in the filtration of the\nother; consequently the underlying filtration is simultaneously the natural\nfiltration for each of the two coupled processes). This survey is followed by a\ndetailed case-study of the simpler but potentially thematic problem of coupling\nBrownian motion together with its local time at $0$. This problem possesses its\nown intrinsic interest as well as being closely related to the BKR coupling\nconstruction. Attention focusses on a simple immersed (co-adapted) coupling,\nnamely the reflection/synchronized coupling. It is shown that this coupling is\noptimal amongst all immersed couplings of Brownian motion together with its\nlocal time at $0$, in the sense of maximizing the coupling probability at all\npossible times, at least when not started at pairs of initial points lying in a\ncertain singular set. However numerical evidence indicates that the coupling is\nnot a maximal coupling, and is a simple but non-trivial instance for which this\ndistinction occurs. It is shown how the reflection/synchronized coupling can be\nconverted into a successful equi-filtration coupling, by modifying the coupling\nusing a deterministic time-delay and then by concatenating an infinite sequence\nof such modified couplings. The construction of an explicit equi-filtration\ncoupling of two copies of the BKR diffusion follows by a direct generalization,\nalthough the proof of success for the BKR coupling requires somewhat more\nanalysis than in the local time case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 18:08:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Dec 2012 16:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 18:05:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 07:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We also investigate the effects of spot parameters and\ndifferential rotation on one's ability to correctly recover rotation periods\nand differential rotation in the Kepler lightcurves. We confirm that in the\nabsence of additional constraints on the stellar inclination, such as\nspectroscopic measurements of vsini or occultations of starspots by planetary\ntransits, the spot latitude and stellar inclination are difficult to determine\nuniquely from the photometry alone. We find that for models with no\ndifferential rotation, spots that appear on opposite hemispheres of the star\nmay cause one to interpret the rotation period to be half of the true period.\nWhen differential rotation is included, the changing longitude separation\nbetween spots breaks the symmetry of the hemispheres and the correct rotation\nperiod is more likely to be found. The dominant period found via periodogram\nanalysis is typically that of the largest spot. Even when multiple spots with\nperiods representative of the star's differential rotation exist, if one spot\ndominates the lightcurve the signal of differential rotation may not be\ndetectable from the periodogram alone. Starspot modeling is applicable to stars\nwith a wider range of rotation rates than other surface imaging techniques\n(such as Doppler imaging), allows subtle signatures of differential rotation to\nbe measured, and may provide valuable information on the distribution of\nstellar spots.

The\nsame system has a tendency to spontaneous formation of a succession of\nhierarchical levels with alternating chirality sign of de-novo formed\nstructures and with an increase of the structures' relative scale.\n  In the living systems the hierarchy principle of conjugated levels of\nmacromolecular structures, starting with the \"lower\" level of asymmetrical\ncarbon, serves as an anti-entropic factor and also as the structural basis of\nthe \"selected mechanical degrees of freedom\" in the molecular machines.\nObservations present evidence of regular alternations of the chirality sign\nD-L-D-L and L-D-L-D for DNA and protein structures, respectively, during the\ntransition of DNA and proteins to a higher level of structural and functional\norganization. Sign-alternating chiral hierarchies of DNA and proteins, in turn,\nform a complementary conjugated pair that is an achiral invariant, which closes\na molecular biological module of living systems.\n  The ability of a carbon atom to form chiral compounds is a significant factor\nthat defined carbon basis of living systems on Earth, and also their\ndevelopment via succession of chiral bifuractions. Restricted by the chirality\nsign, the hierarchy principle of macromolecular structures determined the\n\"modular\" character of biological evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 18:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-10"}

So-called global oscillation parameters\nare inferred to characterize the large sets of stars, to perform ensemble\nasteroseismology, and to derive scaling relations. The mean large separation is\nsuch a key parameter. It is therefore crucial to measure it with the highest\naccuracy. As the conditions of measurement of the large separation do not\ncoincide with its theoretical definition, we revisit the asymptotic expressions\nused for analysing the observed oscillation spectra. Then, we examine the\nconsequence of the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of the\nmean large separation. The analysis is focused on radial modes. We use series\nof radial-mode frequencies to compare the asymptotic and observational values\nof the large separation. We propose a simple formulation to correct the\nobserved value of the large separation and then derive its asymptotic\ncounterpart. We prove that, apart from glitches due to stellar structure\ndiscontinuities, the asymptotic expansion is valid from main-sequence stars to\nred giants. Our model shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as in\nthe theoretical development. High-quality solar-like oscillation spectra\nderived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better described\nwith the second-order asymptotic expansion. The second-order term is\nresponsible for the curvature observed in the \\'echelle diagrams used for\nanalysing the oscillation spectra and this curvature is responsible for the\ndifference between the observed and asymptotic values of the large separation.\nTaking it into account yields a revision of the scaling relations providing\nmore accurate asteroseismic estimates of the stellar mass and radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 19:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 14:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

We first seek to\nclarify the definition of the term RRAT, emphasising that \"the RRAT population\"\nencompasses several phenomenologies. A large subset of RRATs appear to\nrepresent the tail of an extended distribution of pulsar nulling fractions and\nactivity cycles; these objects present several key open questions remaining in\nthis field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The observed 3.6cm images uncover for the\nfirst time that the central powering source AFGL2591-VLA3 has a compact core\nplus collimated jet morphology, extending 4000AU eastward from the central\nsource with an opening angle of <10deg at this radius. However, at 7mm VLA3\ndoes not show a jet morphology, but instead compact (<500AU) emission, some of\nwhich (<0.57 mJy of 2.9mJy) is estimated to be from dust. We determine that the\nmomentum rate of the jet is not sufficient to ionize itself via only shocks,\nand thus a significant portion of the emission is instead likely created in a\nphotoionized wind. The C18O emission uncovers dense entrained material in the\noutflow(s) from the young stars in the region. The main features of the SED and\n2MASS images of AFGL2591-VLA3 are also reproduced by our model dust geometry of\na rotationally flattened envelope with and without a disk.

First the rate is directly proportional to the number\ndensity of a given population, greatly favoring low-mass populations relative\nto their contribution to the general microlensing rate, which further scales as\nsqrt{M} where M is the lens mass. Second, the rate rises sharply as one probes\nsmaller source stars, despite the fact that the probability of transit falls\ndirectly with source size. We propose modifications to current observing\nstrategies that could yield a factor 100 increase in sensitivity to these rare\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 22:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Predicting the properties of such\ncomplex, multicomponent systems with accuracy sufficient to guide and interpret\nexperiments requires realistic modeling of the interparticle interactions and\ncollective behavior of many-particle systems. While the fundamental\ninteractions may be simple, the sheer number of particles and the broad ranges\nof length and time scales confront the modeler with significant computational\nchallenges. A general strategy for mitigating such challenges is to \"coarse\ngrain\" or \"integrate out\" the degrees of freedom of some components, reducing\nthe original multicomponent model to a simpler model of fewer components. The\ntrade-off for so reducing complexity is that the simpler model is governed by\nmodified (effective) interparticle interactions.

The gravitational\npotential of a planet perturbs the disk and leads to characteristic structures,\ni.e. spiral waves and gaps, in the disk's density profile. We perform a\nlarge-scale parameter study of the observability of these planet-induced\nstructures in circumstellar disks with ALMA. On the basis of HD and MHD\nsimulations, we calculated the disk temperature structure and (sub)mm images of\nthese systems. These were used to derive simulated ALMA images. Because\nappropriate objects are frequent in Taurus, we focused on a distance of 140pc\nand a declination of 20{\\deg}. The explored range of star-disk-planet\nconfigurations consists of 6 HD simulations (including magnetic fields and\ndifferent planet masses), 9 disk sizes, 15 total disk masses, 6 different\ncentral stars, and two different grain size distributions. On almost all scales\nand in particular down to a scale of a few AU, ALMA is able to trace disk\nstructures induced by planet-disk interaction or by the influence of magnetic\nfields on the wavelength range between 0.4 and 2.0mm. In most cases, the\noptimum angular resolution is limited by the sensitivity. However, within the\nrange of typical masses of protoplanetary disks (0.1-0.001Msun) the disk mass\nhas a minor impact on the observability. It is possible to resolve disks down\nto 2.67e-6Msun and trace gaps induced by a planet with M_p/M_s = 0.001 in disks\nwith 2.67e-4Msun with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than three. The central\nstar has a major impact on the observability of gaps, as well as the considered\nmaximum grainsize of the dust in the disk. In general, it is more likely to\ntrace planet-induced gaps in our MHD models, because gaps are wider in the\npresence of magnetic fields.

It is found\nthat the results of the experiment can be explained within the framework of\nrelativity, without requiring any violation of the invariance principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 16:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 09:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

Based on this, it is\nshown that compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness on the fuzzy\nnumber space equipped with the level convergence topology. Diamond and Kloeden\ngave a characterization of compact sets in fuzzy number spaces equipped with\nthe supremum metric, Fang and Xue also gave a characterization of compact sets\nin one-dimensional fuzzy number spaces equipped with supremum metric. The\nlatter characterization is just the one-dimensional case of the former\ncharacterization. There exists conflict between the characterization given by\nus and the characterizations given by the above mentioned authors. We point out\nthe characterizations gave by them is incorrect by a counterexample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Dec 2012 10:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-12"}

To capture non-Poissonian features, in order to\nfix the inevitable inherent irregularity, researchers rescale the time axis\nwith tedious computational overhead instead of searching for another\ndistribution. Spikes or action potentials are precisely-timed changes in the\nionic transport through synapses adjusting the synaptic weight, successfully\nmodeled and developed as a memristor. Memristance value is multiples of initial\nresistance. This reminds us with the foundations of quantum mechanics. We try\nto quantize potential and resistance, as done with energy. After reviewing\nPlanck curve for blackbody radiation, we propose the quantization equations. We\nintroduce and prove a theorem that quantizes the resistance. Then we define the\ntyke showing its basic characteristics. Finally we give the basic\ntransformations to model spiking and link an energy quantum to a tyke.\nInvestigation shows how this perfectly models the neuron spiking, with over 97%\nmatch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 18:15:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2013 00:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-06"}

The resemblance between\nwireless sensor network and future internet network, especially in scale\nconsideration as density and network coverage, inspires us to adopt the models\nof the former to the later. Then we test this assumption to see that this\nprovides a concise working model. This paper collects some heuristics that we\ncall them SpiroPlanck and employs them to model the coverage of dense networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for the operation of FI testbeds\ncontaining a test scenario, new representation and visualization techniques,\nand possible performance measures.
