Most\nof the on-axis light must ideally be rejected outside the aperture to be\nblocked with a Lyot stop, while almost all off-axis light must go through it.\nThe unobstructed circular apertures of off-axis telescopes make this possible\nbut all major telescopes are however on-axis and the performance of these\ncoronagraphs is dramatically reduced by the central obstruction. Their\nperformance can be restored by using an additional optimally designed apodizer\nthat changes the amplitude in the first pupil plane so that the on-axis light\nis rejected outside the obstructed aperture of the telescope. The numerical\noptimization model is built by maximizing the apodizer's transmission while\nsetting constraints on the extremum values of the electric field that the Lyot\nstop does not block. The coronagraphic image is compared to what a non-apodized\nphase mask coronagraph provides and an analysis is made of the trade-offs that\nexist between the apodizer transmission and the Lyot stop properties. The\nexistence of a solution and the mask transmission depend on the aperture and\nthe Lyot stop geometries, and on the constraints that are set on the on-axis\nattenuation. The system throughput is a concave function of the Lyot stop\ntransmission.

This system has one of the longest orbital periods known (13.5yr) and\nwas initially classified as a zet_Aur-type variable.

There was a suspicion that this system could\nbe similar to eclipsing systems with extensive dusty disks like EECep and\neps_Aur. This and other, alternative hypotheses are considered.\n  The ASAS-3 VI light curves have been used to examine photometric changes.\nLow-(LRS) and high-res.(HRS) spectra have been used for spectral\nclassification, to analyse line profiles, as well as to determine the\nreddening, radial velocities (RVs) and distance. The SED was analysed. Using\noriginal numerical code, we performed a simplified model of the eclipse, taking\ninto account the pulsations of one of the components.\n  The LRS shows traces of molecular bands, characteristic of an M-type\nsupergiant. The presence of this star in the system is confirmed by SED, by a\nstrong dependence of the eclipse depth on the photometric bands, and by\npulsational changes. The presence of a low excitation nebula around the system\nhas been inferred from [OI] 6300A emission. Analysis of the RVs, reddening, and\nP-L relation for Mira-type stars imply a distance to the V383Sco of 8.4+-0.6\nkpc. The distance to the nearby V381Sco is 6.4+-0.8 kpc. The very different and\noppositely directed RVs of these systems (89.8 vs -178.8 km/s) seem to be in\nagreement with a bulge/bar kinematic model of the Galactic centre and\ninconsistent with purely circular motion.\n  We have found evidence for the presence of a pulsating M-type supergiant in\nthe V383Sco which periodically obscures the much more luminous F0I-type star,\ncausing the deep (possibly total) eclipses which vary in duration and shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 18:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

However, applications\nwith input-dependent noise (heteroscedastic residuals) frequently arise in\npractice, as do applications in which the residuals do not have a Gaussian\ndistribution. In this paper, we propose a GP Regression model with a latent\nvariable that serves as an additional unobserved covariate for the regression.\nThis model (which we call GPLC) allows for heteroscedasticity since it allows\nthe function to have a changing partial derivative with respect to this\nunobserved covariate. With a suitable covariance function, our GPLC model can\nhandle (a) Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance, or (b)\nnon-Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance, or (c) Gaussian residuals\nwith constant variance. We compare our model, using synthetic datasets, with a\nmodel proposed by Goldberg, Williams and Bishop (1998), which we refer to as\nGPLV, which only deals with case (a), as well as a standard GP model which can\nhandle only case (c). Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are developed for both\nmodelsl. Experiments show that when the data is heteroscedastic, both GPLC and\nGPLV give better results (smaller mean squared error and negative\nlog-probability density) than standard GP regression. In addition, when the\nresidual are Gaussian, our GPLC model is generally nearly as good as GPLV,\nwhile when the residuals are non-Gaussian, our GPLC model is better than GPLV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 20:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

The band structure of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene consists of\na monolayer-like and a bilayer-like pairs of bands. Here we study electronic\nproperties of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene biased by a perpendicular electric\nfield. We find that the combination of the bias and trigonal warping gives rise\nto a set of new Dirac points: in each valley, seven species of Dirac fermions\nwith small masses of order of a few meV emerge. The positions and masses of the\nemergent Dirac fermions are tunable by bias, and one group of Dirac fermions\nbecomes massless at a certain bias value. Therefore, in contrast to bilayer\ngraphene, the conductivity at the neutrality point is expected to show\nnon-monotonic behavior, becoming of the order of a few e^2/h when some Dirac\nmasses vanish. Further, we analyze the evolution of Landau level spectrum as a\nfunction of bias. Emergence of new Dirac points in the band structure\ntranslates into new three-fold-degenerate groups of Landau levels. This leads\nto an anomalous quantum Hall effect, in which some quantum Hall steps have a\nheight of 3e^2/h. At an intermediate bias, the degeneracies of all Landau\nlevels get lifted, and in this regime all quantum Hall plateaus are spaced by\ne^2/h. Finally, we show that the pattern of Landau level crossings is very\nsensitive to certain band structure parameters, and can therefore provide a\nuseful tool for determining their precise values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 20:50:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 12:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-08"}

By looking at\nmultiple data sets and model spectra, we conclude that the blue component of\nthe Ca H&K feature is caused by Si II 3858 for most SNe Ia. The strength of the\nSi II 3858 feature varies strongly with the light-curve shape of a SN. As a\nresult, the velocity measured from a single-Gaussian fit to the full line\nprofile correlates with light-curve shape. The velocity of the Ca H&K component\nof the profile does not correlate with light-curve shape, contrary to previous\nclaims. We detail the pitfalls of assuming that the blue component of the Ca\nH&K feature is caused by calcium, with implications for our understanding of SN\nIa progenitors, explosions, and cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 20:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The skew scattering and side-jump scattering terms\nin the SHE vanish, but we identify two additional terms in the SHE, due to\nr_so, which have not been considered in the literature so far. One term\nreflects the modification of the spin precession due to the action of the\nexternal electric field (the field drives the current in the quantum well),\nwhich produces, via r_so, an effective magnetic field perpendicular to the\nplane of the quantum well. The other term reflects a similar modification of\nthe spin precession due to the action of the electric field created by random\nimpurities, and appears in a careful formulation of the Born approximation. We\nrefer to these two effects collectively as anomalous spin precession and we\nnote that they contribute to the SHE to the first order in the SO coupling\nconstant even though they formally appear to be of second order. In electron\nsystems with weak momentum scattering, the contribution of the anomalous spin\nprecession due to the external electric field equals 1/2 the usual side-jump\nSHE, while the additional impurity-dependent contribution depends on the form\nof the band structure SO coupling. For band structure SO linear in wave vector\nthe two additional contributions cancel.

In accord with the RFOT, we find\nthat as the volume fraction of the colloidal particles \\f, the natural variable\nthat controls glass formation in colloidal systems, approaches \\f_A there is an\neffective ergodic to non-ergodic dynamical transition, which is signalled by a\ndramatic slowing down of diffusion. In addition, using the energy metric we\nshow that the system becomes non-ergodic as \\f_A is approached. The time t^*,\nat which the four-point dynamical susceptibility achieves a maximum, also\ndiverges near \\f_A. Remarkably, three independent measures(translational\ndiffusion coefficients, ergodic diffusion coefficients,as well t^*) all signal\nthat at \\f_A=0.1 ergodicity is effectively broken. The translation diffusion\nconstant, the ergodic diffusion constant, and (t^*)^-1 all vanish as\n(\\f_A-\\f)^g with both \\f_A and g being the roughly the same for all three\nquantities.

The superconducting gap in\nthe leads suppresses the hot electron outflow, allowing us to further study\nelectron thermalization by phonons at low temperatures ($T \\lesssim 1$K). The\nrelationship between the applied power and the electron temperature was found\nto be $P\\propto T^3$, which we argue is consistent with cooling due to\nelectron-phonon interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2012 04:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-09"}

In an approach\nbased on statistical physics one needs to know the interaction Hamiltonian. For\nnon-physical systems, based on qualitative arguments similar to those used in\nphysical chemistry, interaction strength gives useful clues about the\nmacroscopic properties of the system. Even though our ultimate objective is the\nunderstanding of social phenomena, we found that systems composed of insects\n(or other living organisms) are of great convenience for investigating group\neffects. In this paper we show how to design experiments that enable us to\nestimate the strength of interaction in groups of insects. By repeating the\nsame experiments with increasing numbers of insects, ranging from less than 10\nto several hundreds, one is able to explore key-properties of the interaction.\nThe data turn out to be consistent with a global correlation that is\nindependent of distance (at least within a range of a few centimetres).\nEstimates of this average cross-correlation will be given for ants, beetles and\nfruit flies. The experimental results clearly exclude an Ising-like\ninteraction, that is to say one that would be restricted to nearest neighbours.\nIn the case of fruit flies the average cross-correlation appears to be negative\nwhich means that instead of an inter-individual attraction there is a (weak)\nrepulsive effect. In our conclusion we insist on the fact that such\n\"physics-like experiments\" on insect populations provide a valuable alternative\nto computer simulations.

As an explicit approximation for the free-energy functional for\nhard sphere mixtures, the diagrammatic structure of Rosenfeld's fundamental\nmeasure density unctional is laid out. Recent extensions, based on the\nKierlik-Rosinberg scalar weight functions, to binary and ternary non-additive\nhard sphere mixtures are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2012 12:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

From a correlation analysis with the cloud\nmap data from the Earth Observing Satellite (EOS), we find that their variation\npattern is primarily due to the uneven cloud cover distribution. In order to\naccount for the observed variation quantitatively, we consider a simple opaque\ncloud model, which assumes that the clouds totally block the spectral influence\nof the atmosphere below the cloud layer, equivalent to assuming that the\nincident light is completely scattered at the cloud top level. The model is\nreasonably successful, and reproduces the EPOXI data from the pixel-level EOS\ncloud/water vapor data. A difference in the diurnal variability patterns of H2O\nand O2 bands is ascribed to the differing vertical and horizontal distribution\nof those molecular species in the atmosphere. On the Earth, the inhomogeneous\ndistribution of atmospheric water vapor is due to the existence of its exchange\nwith liquid and solid phases of H2O on the planet's surface on a timescale\nshort compared to atmospheric mixing times. If such differences in variability\npatterns were detected in spectra of Earth-analogs, it would provide the\ninformation on the inhomogeneous composition of their atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Dec 2012 14:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Since conventional process discovery algorithms have been defined\nfor batch processing, it is difficult to apply them in such evolving\nenvironments. Existing algorithms cannot cope with streaming event data and\ntend to generate unreliable and obsolete results.\n  In this paper, we discuss the peculiarities of dealing with streaming event\ndata in the context of process mining.
