For this purpose it\nis useful to consider analogues of tropical varieties in complex space. These\nanalogues are called exponential tropical varieties (ETV). We construct the\nring of ETV. Algebraic tropical varieties form the subring of the ring of ETV.\nIn this paper we connect ETV with the complex Monge-Ampere operator action on\nthe space of piecewise linear functions in complex vector space. We show that\nall ETV arise as results of such operator action. We give some applications of\nthis connection. One of the applications is a criterion for zero value of a\nmixed Monge-Ampere operator. This criterion is the modification of the\ncriterion for zero value of a mixed volume of convex bodies. The proof is the\nmodification of A. Khovanskii's unpublished proof of the corresponding theorem\non mixed volumes. In the part 1 we give the definition of ETV and detail\nstatements of theorems (without proofs).

However, in most instances the control\nlaw is obtained without any performance considerations and it has to be\ncalculated by solving a complex partial differential equation (PDE). In order\nto address these issues we introduce a reinforcement learning approach into the\nenergy-balancing passivity-based control (EB-PBC) method, which is a form of\nPBC in which the closed-loop energy is equal to the difference between the\nstored and supplied energies. We propose a technique to parameterize EB-PBC\nthat preserves the systems's PDE matching conditions, does not require the\nspecification of a global desired Hamiltonian, includes performance criteria,\nand is robust to extra non-linearities such as control input saturation. The\nparameters of the control law are found using actor-critic reinforcement\nlearning, enabling learning near-optimal control policies satisfying a desired\nclosed-loop energy landscape. The advantages are that near-optimal controllers\ncan be generated using standard energy shaping techniques and that the\nsolutions learned can be interpreted in terms of energy shaping and damping\ninjection, which makes it possible to numerically assess stability using\npassivity theory. From the reinforcement learning perspective, our proposal\nallows for the class of port-Hamiltonian systems to be incorporated in the\nactor-critic framework, speeding up the learning thanks to the resulting\nparameterization of the policy. The method has been successfully applied to the\npendulum swing-up problem in simulations and real-life experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 16:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 16:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

For the\nparticular case of legged locomotion, the movement of each leg is abstracted to\ntwo-state circuits: swing and stance (leg in flight and on the ground,\nrespectively). The generation of a gait (a manner of walking) for a multiple\nlegged robot is then achieved by synchronizing the multiple discrete-event\ncycles via the max-plus framework.

We study an event\nfrom 03-Nov-2010 (peaking at 12:20UT in GOES soft X-rays) of a coronal mass\nejection and occulted flare which demonstrates the morphology of a classic\nerupting flux rope. The high spatial, and time resolution, and six coronal\nchannels, of the SDO/AIA images allows the dynamics of the multi-thermal\nemission during the initial phases of eruption to be studied in detail. The\nDifferential Emission Measure (DEM) is calculated, using an optimised version\nof a regularized inversion method (Hannah & Kontar 2012), for each pixel across\nthe six channels at different times, resulting in emission measure maps and\nmovies in a variety of temperature ranges. We find that the core of the\nerupting plasmoid is hot (8-11, 11-14MK) with a similarly hot filamentary\n\"stem\" structure connecting it to the lower atmosphere, which could be\ninterpreted as the current sheet in the flux rope model, though is wider than\nthese models suggest.

This structure has been associated with\nthe two-ribbon flare, filament eruption, and coronal mass ejection originating\nin active region 10759 (NOAA number).

The chain of\nobservations from the photosphere to interplanetary space is in agreement with\nthis scenario.

In this perspective, we first present the background for and\npower of omni-tomography, then discuss its important applications in vulnerable\nplaque characterization and intratumor heterogeneity evaluation, review its\nenabling theory and technology, explain for the first time the feasibility of\nthe CT-MRI scanner as an example, and finally suggest exciting research\nopportunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 20:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-24"}

Many\nresearchers have studied these networks to provide design guidelines for more\nrobust power grids. Topological analysis is one of the components of system\nanalysis for its robustness. This paper presents a complex systems analysis of\npower grid networks. First, the cascading effect has been simulated on three\nwell known networks: the IEEE 300 bus test system, the IEEE 118 bus test\nsystem, and the WSCC 179 bus equivalent model. To extend the analysis to a\nlarger set of networks, we develop a network generator and generate multiple\ngraphs with characteristics similar to the IEEE test networks but with\ndifferent topologies. The generated graphs are then compared to the test\nnetworks to show the effect of topology in determining their robustness with\nrespect to cascading failures. The generated graphs turn out to be more robust\nthan the test graphs, showing the importance of topology in the robust design\nof power grids. The second part of this paper concerns the discussion of two\nnovel mitigation strategies for cascading failures: Targeted Load Reduction and\nIslanding using Distributed Sources. These new mitigation strategies are\ncompared with the Homogeneous Load Reduction strategy. Even though the\nHomogeneous Load Reduction is simpler to implement, the Targeted Load Reduction\nis much more effective. Additionally, an algorithm is presented for the\npartitioning of the network for islanding as an effort towards fault isolation\nto prevent cascading failures. The results for island formation are better if\nthe sources are well distributed, else the algorithm leads to the formation of\nsuperislands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 22:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

Here we study Knot 51, a representative, bright example, for which\nwe have available long slit optical and NIR spectra covering emission lines\nfrom ionized, neutral, and molecular gas, as well as HST visible and SOAR\nTelescope NIR narrow-band images. We present a series of CLOUDY simulations to\nprobe the excitation mechanisms, formation processes and dust content in\nenvironments that can produce the observed H2 emission. We do not try for an\nexact match between model and observations given Knot 51's ambiguous geometry.\nRather, we aim to explain how the bright H2 emission lines can be formed from\nwithin the volume of Knot 51 that also produces the observed optical emission\nfrom ionized and neutral gas. Our models that are powered only by the Crab's\nsynchrotron radiation are ruled out because they cannot reproduce the strong,\nthermal H2 emission. The simulations that come closest to fitting the\nobservations have the core of Knot 51 almost entirely atomic with the H2\nemission coming from just a trace molecular component, and in which there is\nextra heating. In this unusual environment, H2 forms primarily by associative\ndetachment rather than grain catalysis. In this picture, the 55 H2-emitting\ncores that we have previously catalogued in the Crab have a total mass of about\n0.1 M_sun, which is about 5% of the total mass of the system of filaments. We\nalso explore the effect of varying the dust abundance.

One\ncan ask whether this state has partial Bloch character \"k\" corresponding to a\nfiner scale of periodicity \"r\". Answering this is called \"unfolding.\" A theorem\nis proven that yields a mathematically clear prescription for unfolding, by\nexamining translational properties of the state, requiring no \"reference\nstates\" or basis functions with the finer periodicity (r,k). A question then\narises, how should one assign partial Bloch character to a state of a finite\nsystem? A slab, finite in one direction, is used as the example. Perpendicular\ncomponents k_z of the wavevector are not explicitly defined, but may be hidden\nin the state (and eigenvector |i>.) A prescription for extracting k_z is\noffered and tested. An idealized silicon (111) surface is used as the example.\nSlab-unfolding reveals surface-localized states and resonances which were not\nevident from dispersion curves alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Dec 2012 15:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-14"}

Electric load\nprofiles of tropical islands in developed countries are characterised by\nmorning, midday and evening peaks arising from all year round high power demand\nin the commercial and residential sectors, mostly due to air conditioning\nappliances and bad thermal conception of the building. In early 1995, a DSM\npilot initiative has been launched in the french islands of Guadeloupe and\nReunion through a partnership between the French Public Utility EDF,\ninstitutions involved in energy conservation, environment preservation (ADEME)\nand construction quality improvment, the University of Reunion Island and\nseveral other public and private partners (low cost housing institutions,\narchitects, energy consultant, etc...) to set up a standard in the thermal\nconception of buildings in tropical climates. This has led to definition of\noptimized bioclimatic urban planning and architectural design, the use of\npassive cooling architectural components, natural ventilation and energy\nefficient systems. The impact of each technical solution on the thermal comfort\nwithin the building was evaluated with an airflow and thermal building\nsimulation software (CODYRUN). These technical solutions have been edited in a\npedagogical reference document and have been implemented in 300 new pilot\ndwelling projects through the year 1996 in Reunion Island and in Guadeloupe\nisland. An experimental follow up is still in process in the first ECODOM\ndwellings for an experimental validation of the impact of the passive cooling\nsolutions on the comfort of the occupants and to modify them if necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 18:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

It devastated the forested area of\n2150 sq. km, flattening and scorching some 30 million trees. Before this, a\nluminous body flew overhead in the cloudless sky. The air waves from the\nexplosion were recorded as far as in London. The object that flew that morning\nover Siberia is usually designated the \"Tunguska meteorite\" or - more\ncautiously - the \"Tunguska space body\" (TSB). Certainly, this body was\ndangerous: the taiga was leveled over an area twice as large as New York City.\nThe whole number of Tunguska hypotheses reaches a hundred, or so. But few of\nthem have been built according to the standards of science and with due\nconsideration of empirical data. There is also a serious methodological problem\nthat is, as a rule, overlooked: the need to take into consideration all\nempirical data and to reconstruct the Tunguska event before building any models\nof it. Such a reconstruction is essential - since the consequences of this\nevent are many and varied. The main Tunguska traces may be grouped and listed\nas follows: (a) material traces; (b) instrumental traces; (c) informational\ntraces. To be sure that a proposed theory is correct, the scientist must check\nit against all the three types of Tunguska evidence.
