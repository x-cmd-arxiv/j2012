As a consequence, we obtain a single\nuniversal tile type of a single (constant-size) shape that serves as a\n\"universal tile machine\": the single universal tile type can simulate any\ndesired aTAM system when given a single seed assembly that encodes the desired\naTAM system.

Our most\nimportant result is the detection of an isotropic component of foreground\nradiation due to interstellar dust.\n  The dust in the inner solar system is known to have a fan-like distribution.\nIf this is assumed to extend to the orbit of Mars, we find that cometary,\nasteroidal and interstellar dust account for 70%, 22% and 7.5% of the dust in\nthe fan. We find a worse fit if the fan is assumed to extend to the orbit of\nJupiter. Our model is broadly consistent with the analysis by Divine (1993) of\ninterplanetary dust detected by Ulysses and other spacecraft. Our estimate of\nthe mass-density of interstellar dust in the inner solar system is consistent\nwith estimates from Ulysses at 1.5 au, but is an order of magnitude higher than\nUlysses estimates at r > 4 au. Only 1% of the zodiacal dust arriving at the\nearth would be interstellar, in our model.\n  Our models can be further tested by ground-based kinematical studies of the\nzodiacal cloud, which need to extend over a period of years to monitor solar\ncycle variations in interstellar dust, by dynamical simulations, and by in situ\nmeasurements from spacecraft.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 17:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-03"}

For the common case in which the\nforward operator is smoothing, then the inverse problem is ill-posed.\nWell-posedness is imposed via regularisation in the form of a prior, which is\noften Gaussian. Under quite general conditions, it can be shown that the\nposterior is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior and it may be\nwell-defined on function space in terms of its density with respect to the\nprior. In this case, by constructing a proposal for which the prior is\ninvariant, one can define Metropolis-Hastings schemes for MCMC which are\nwell-defined on function space, and hence do not degenerate as the dimension of\nthe underlying quantity of interest increases to infinity, e.g. under mesh\nrefinement when approximating PDE in finite dimensions. However, in practice,\ndespite the attractive theoretical properties of the currently available\nschemes, they may still suffer from long correlation times, particularly if the\ndata is very informative about some of the unknown parameters.

In two\ndimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized\nenergy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. In 1976\nDouglas Hofstadter theoretically considered the intersection of these two\nproblems and discovered that 2D electrons subjected to both a magnetic field\nand a periodic electrostatic potential exhibit a self-similar recursive energy\nspectrum. Known as Hofstadter's butterfly, this complex spectrum results from a\ndelicate interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two\nquantizing fields, and represents one of the first quantum fractals discovered\nin physics. In the decades since, experimental attempts to study this effect\nhave been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical\ncrystalline systems (<1 nm periodicity) require impossibly large magnetic\nfields to reach the commensurability condition, while in artificially\nengineered structures (>100 nm), the corresponding fields are too small to\ncompletely overcome disorder. Here we demonstrate that moire superlattices\narising in bilayer graphene coupled to hexagonal boron nitride provide a nearly\nideal-sized periodic modulation, enabling unprecedented experimental access to\nthe fractal spectrum. We confirm that quantum Hall effect features associated\nwith the fractal gaps are described by two integer topological quantum numbers,\nand report evidence of their recursive structure. Observation of Hofstadter's\nspectrum in graphene provides the further opportunity to investigate emergent\nbehaviour within a fractal energy landscape in a system with tunable internal\ndegrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 18:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-17"}

However, understanding the\nbiology of organismal phenotypes will involve understanding regulation in\nmultiple tissues, and ongoing studies are collecting eQTL data in dozens of\ncell types. Here we present a statistical framework for powerfully detecting\neQTLs in multiple tissues or cell types (or, more generally, multiple\nsubgroups). The framework explicitly models the potential for each eQTL to be\nactive in some tissues and inactive in others. By modeling the sharing of\nactive eQTLs among tissues this framework increases power to detect eQTLs that\nare present in more than one tissue compared with \"tissue-by-tissue\" analyses\nthat examine each tissue separately. Conversely, by modeling the inactivity of\neQTLs in some tissues, the framework allows the proportion of eQTLs shared\nacross different tissues to be formally estimated as parameters of a model,\naddressing the difficulties of accounting for incomplete power when comparing\noverlaps of eQTLs identified by tissue-by-tissue analyses. Applying our\nframework to re-analyze data from transformed B cells, T cells and fibroblasts\nwe find that it substantially increases power compared with tissue-by-tissue\nanalysis, identifying 63% more genes with eQTLs (at FDR=0.05). Further the\nresults suggest that, in contrast to previous analyses of the same data, the\nmajority of eQTLs detectable in these data are shared among all three tissues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 18:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-12"}

[PODC'03]. Equilibrium networks in these\nmodels have desirable properties like low social cost and small diameter, which\nmakes them attractive for the decentralized creation of overlay-networks.\nUnfortunately, due to the non-constructiveness of the Nash equilibrium, no\ndistributed algorithm for finding such networks is known. We treat these games\nas sequential-move games and analyze whether (uncoordinated) selfish play\neventually converges to an equilibrium state. Thus, we shed light on one of the\nmost natural algorithms for this problem: distributed local search, where in\neach step some agent performs a myopic selfish improving move.\n  We show that fast convergence is guaranteed for all versions of Swap Games,\nintroduced by Alon et al. [SPAA'10], if the initial network is a tree, and show\nthat this process can be sped up to an almost optimal number of moves. For\nnon-tree networks we show the surprising result that even one non-tree edge\nsuffices to destroy the convergence guarantee and no move policy can enforce\nconvergence. This answers an open problem from Ehsani et al. [SPAA'11] in the\nnegative. We extend our negative results to the well-studied original version\nand prove that there is no convergence guarantee -- even if all agents play\noptimally.

This scenario can be\ninvestigated through deep optical/infrared (IR) observations. We used J, H,\nK-band images, obtained as part of the UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared\nDeep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and available in the recent Data Release 9 Plus, to\nsearch for its undetected companion of the PSR J1811-1736 binary pulsar.

These are non-compactly-generated black holes in which a single\nconnected bulk horizon extends to meet the conformal boundary. Thus the induced\n(conformal) boundary metric has smooth horizons as well. In our examples, the\nboundary spacetime contains a pair of black holes connected through the bulk by\na tubular bulk horizon. Taking one boundary black hole to be hotter than the\nother ($\\Delta T \\neq 0$) prohibits equilibrium. The result is a so-called\nflowing funnel, a stationary bulk black hole with a non-Killing horizon that\nmay be said to transport heat toward the cooler boundary black hole. While\ngenerators of the bulk future horizon evolve toward zero expansion in the far\nfuture, they begin at finite affine parameter with infinite expansion on a\nsingular past horizon characterized by power-law divergences with universal\nexponents. We explore both the horizon generators and the boundary stress\ntensor in detail. While most of our results are numerical, a semi-analytic\nfluid/gravity description can be obtained by passing to a one-parameter\ngeneralization of the above boundary conditions.

We propose that the source is naturally\nexplained by another channel, a tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by an\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The tidal disruption is accompanied by a\ntidal pinching, which leads to the ignition of a WD and a supernova.

The accretion rate temporal dependence Mdot(t) in a tidal disruption\nprovides a good fit to soft X-ray lightcurve.

This material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range in\nparameters. However, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. In\norder to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literature\nsearch for papers reporting the parameters of the soft X-ray warm absorbers\n(WAs) in 35 type 1 Seyferts and compared their properties to those of the\nultra-fast outflows (UFOs) detected in the same sample. The fraction of sources\nwith WAs is >60%, consistent with previous studies. The fraction of sources\nwith UFOs is >34%, >67% of which also show WAs. The large dynamic range\nobtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the first\ntime, to investigate general relations among them. In particular, we find\nsignificant correlations indicating that the closer the absorber is to the\ncentral black hole, the higher the ionization, column, outflow velocity and\nconsequently the mechanical power. The absorbers continuously populate the\nwhole parameter space, with the WAs and the UFOs lying always at the two ends\nof the distribution. This strongly suggest that these absorbers, often\nconsidered of different types, could actually represent parts of a single\nlarge-scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the black\nhole. The observed parameters and correlations are consistent with both\nradiation pressure through Compton scattering and MHD processes contributing to\nthe outflow acceleration, the latter playing a major role.

This allows low energy flavor\nconstraints to be easily satisfied and leaves open the possibility of flavor\ngauge bosons accessible at the LHC. The usual MSSM RPV operators are all\nforbidden by the new gauge symmetry, but the model allows a purely \"exotic\"\noperator which violates both R-parity and baryon number. Since the exotic\nfields mix with MSSM-like right handed quarks, diagonalizing the full mass\nmatrix after flavor-breaking transforms this operator into the trilinear baryon\nnumber violating operator UDD with flavor coefficients all suppressed by three\npowers of Yukawa couplings.

Nevertheless there is a parameter region where the dPI occurs\ninside the FM phase, leading to their coexistence.

The main objectives of Part 1 are to\npostulate a new principle of representation invariance (PRI), and to refine the\nunified field model of four interactions, derived using the principle of\ninteraction dynamics (PID). Intuitively, PID takes the variation of the action\nfunctional under energy-momentum conservation constraint, and PRI requires that\nphysical laws be independent of representations of the gauge groups. One\nimportant outcome of this field model is a natural duality between the\ninteracting fields and the adjoint bosonic fields. This duality predicts two\nHiggs particles of similar mass with one due to weak interaction and the other\ndue to strong interaction. The field model can be naturally decoupled to study\nindividual interactions, leading to 1) modified Einstein equations, giving rise\nto a unified theory for dark matter and dark energy, 2) three levels of strong\ninteraction potentials for quark, nucleon/hadron, and atom respectively, and 3)\ntwo weak interaction potentials. These potential/force formulas offer a clear\nmechanism for both quark confinement and asymptotic freedom. The main\nobjectives of Part 2 are 1) to propose a sub-leptons and sub-quark model, which\nwe call weakton model, and 2) to derive a mechanism for all sub-atomic decays\nand bremsstrahlung. The weakton model postulates that all matter particles and\nmediators are made up of massless weaktons. The weakton model offers a perfect\nexplanation for all sub-atomic decays and all generation/annihilation precesses\nof matter-antimatter. In particular, the precise constituents of particles\ninvolved in all decays both before and after the reaction can now be precisely\nderived. In addition, the bremsstrahlung phenomena can be understood using the\nweakton model. Also, the weakton model offers an explanation to the baryon\nasymmetry problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 01:54:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2013 19:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2013 12:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-26"}

The added costs depend on several\nfactors including market design, performance of renewable generation\nforecasting and the specific dispatch procedure. Quantifying these costs has\nbeen limited to small sample Monte Carlo approaches applied specific dispatch\nalgorithms. The computational complexity and accuracy of these approaches has\nlimited the understanding of tradeoffs between different factors. {In this work\nwe consider a two-stage stochastic economic dispatch problem. Our goal is to\nprovide an analytical quantification and an intuitive understanding of the\neffects of uncertainties and network congestion on the dispatch procedure and\nthe optimal cost.} We first consider an uncongested network and calculate the\nrisk limiting dispatch. In addition, we derive the price of uncertainty, a\nnumber that characterizes the intrinsic impact of uncertainty on the\nintegration cost of renewables. Then we extend the results to a network where\none link can become congested. Under mild conditions, we calculate price of\nuncertainty even in this case. We show that risk limiting dispatch is given by\na set of deterministic equilibrium equations. The dispatch solution yields an\nimportant insight: congested links do not create isolated nodes, even in a\ntwo-node network. In fact, the network can support backflows in congested\nlinks, that are useful to reduce the uncertainty by averaging supply across the\nnetwork. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in standard IEEE\nbenchmark networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 01:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 17:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

This accelerating growth phenomenon can be\nwell described by a super-linear power law $X \\propto P^{\\gamma}$($\\gamma>1$).\nHowever, the explanation on this phenomenon is still lack. In this paper, we\npropose a modeling framework called growing random geometric models to explain\nthe super-linear relationship. A growing network is constructed on an abstract\ngeometric space. The new coming node can only survive if it just locates on an\nappropriate place in the space where other nodes exist, then new edges are\nconnected with the adjacent nodes whose number is determined by the density of\nexisting nodes. Thus the total number of edges can grow with the number of\nnodes in a faster speed exactly following the super-linear power law. The\nmodels cannot only reproduce a lot of observed phenomena in complex networks,\ne.g., scale-free degree distribution and asymptotically size-invariant\nclustering coefficient, but also resemble the known patterns of cities, such as\nfractal growing, area-population and diversity-population scaling relations,\netc. Strikingly, only one important parameter, the dimension of the geometric\nspace, can really influence the super-linear growth exponent $\\gamma$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 03:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}

In this paper, we\ndevelop a mathematical framework to analyze such economic issues. Inspired by\nthe idea from cooperative game theory, we propose a cooperative\nprofit-distribution model based on Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), in which\neyeball ISPs and Peer-assisted CPs (PCPs) form two coalitions respectively and\nthen compute a fair Pareto point to determine profit distribution. Moreover, we\ndesign a fair and feasible mechanism for profit distribution within each\ncoalition.

We analyse the\ndisc counterpart to type II spicules, RBEs, in three high quality datasets from\nCRISP at the SST. In a quiet Sun region at disc centre we find lower Doppler\nvelocities, 15-40km/s, and Doppler widths, 2-15km/s, of RBEs than in earlier\ncoronal hole studies, 30-50km/s and 7-23km/s, respectively. We examine the\nspatial dependence of Doppler velocities and widths along RBE axes and conclude\nthat there is no clear trend over the FOV or in individual RBEs in quiet Sun at\ndisc centre. These differences with previous coronal hole studies are\nattributed to the more varying magnetic field configuration in quiet Sun\nconditions. Using an extremely high cadence dataset allowed us to improve\ngreatly on the determination of lifetimes of RBEs, found to range from 5 to 60s\nwith an average of 30s, as well as the transverse motions in RBEs, with\ntransverse velocities up to 55km/s and averaging 12km/s. Furthermore, our\nmeasurements of the recurrence rates of RBEs provide important new constraints\non coronal heating by spicules. We also see many examples of a sinusoidal wave\npattern in the transverse motion with periods averaging 54s and amplitudes from\n21.5 to 129km, agreeing well with previous studies of wave motion in limb\nspicules. We interpret the appearance of RBEs over their full length within a\nfew seconds as the result of a combination of three kinds of motions as\nreported earlier for spicules. Finally, we look at the temporal connection\nbetween Ha and Ca 8542 RBEs and find Ca 8542 in addition to being located\ncloser to the footpoint also appear before the Ha RBE. This connection supports\nthe idea that heating occurs in spicules and contribute more weight to the\nprominence of spicules as a source for heating and mass loading of the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 11:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 10:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

As an alternative to the classical Turing bifurcation, it has been\nproposed that the cell polarity might onset by means of the well-known\nphenomenon of wave-pinning (Gamba et al, PNAS, 2005). A particularly simple and\nelegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and\ncoworkers (Biop. J., 2008). However, biomolecular networks do communicate with\nother networks as well as with the external world. As such, their dynamics has\nto be considered as perturbed by extrinsic noises. These noises may have both a\nspatial and a temporal correlation, but any case they must be bounded to\npreserve the biological meaningfulness of the perturbed parameters. Here we\nnumerically show that the inclusion of external spatio-temporal bounded\nperturbations may sometime destroy the polarized state. The polarization loss\ndepends on both the extent of temporal and spatial correlations, and on the\nkind of adopted noise. Namely, independently of the specific model of noise, an\nincrease of the spatial correlation induces an increase of the probability of\npolarization. However, if the noise is spatially homogeneous then the\npolarization is lost in the majority of cases. On the contrary, an increase of\nthe temporal autocorrelation of the noise induces an effect that depends on the\nnoise model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 11:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

As the dimension of the underlying vector space grows\nexponentially in the number of particles, one has to consider appropriate\nsubsets promising both convenient approximation properties and efficient\ncomputations. The variational ansatz for this numerical approach leads to the\nminimization of the Rayleigh quotient. The Alternating Least Squares technique\nis then applied to break down the eigenvector computation to problems of\nappropriate size, which can be solved by classical methods. Efficient\ncomputations require fast computation of the matrix-vector product and of the\ninner product of two decomposed vectors. To this end, both appropriate\nrepresentations of vectors and efficient contraction schemes are needed.\n  Here approaches from many-body quantum physics for one-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional systems (Matrix Product States and Projected Entangled Pair\nStates) are treated mathematically in terms of tensors. We give the definition\nof these concepts, bring some results concerning uniqueness and numerical\nstability and show how computations can be executed efficiently within these\nconcepts.

To adapt fast traffic\nand channel fluctuations and improve the spectrum efficiency, the system should\nhave the ability to dynamically allocate subcarriers and power resources to\nusers. Assuming perfect channel knowledge, two formulations for the joint\nsubcarrier and power allocation problem are considered in this paper: the first\nis to minimize the total transmission power subject to quality of service\nconstraints and the OFDMA constraint, and the second is to maximize some system\nutility function (including the sum-rate utility, the proportional fairness\nutility, the harmonic mean utility, and the min-rate utility) subject to the\ntotal transmission power constraint per user and the OFDMA constraint. In spite\nof the existence of various heuristics approaches, little is known about the\ncomputational complexity status of the above problem. This paper aims to fill\nthis theoretical gap, i.e., characterizing the complexity of the joint\nsubcarrier and power allocation problem for the multi-user OFDMA system. It is\nshown in this paper that both formulations of the joint subcarrier and power\nallocation problem are strongly NP-hard. The proof is based on a polynomial\ntime transformation from the so-called 3-dimensional matching problem. Several\nsubclasses of the problem which can be solved to global optimality or\n$\\epsilon$-global optimality in polynomial time are also identified. These\ncomplexity results suggest that there are not polynomial time algorithms which\nare able to solve the general joint subcarrier and power allocation problem to\nglobal optimality (unless P$=$NP), and determining an approximately optimal\nsubcarrier and power allocation strategy is more realistic in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 13:14:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2013 00:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2013 06:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-19"}

The total absorbed flux was in the range 2.2-2.6 x\n10^(-11) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1), corresponding to unabsorbed luminosity 7-8.5 x\n10^(36)x(d/12 kpc)^2 for N(H)=2-2.7x10^(21) cm^(-2). On day 18, 70% of the soft\nX-tray flux was in a continuum typical of a very hot white dwarf (WD)\natmosphere, which accounted for about 80% of the flux on days 23 and 35. In\naddition all spectra display very broad emission lines, due to higher\nionization stages at later times.\n  With Chandra we observed apparent P Cygni profiles. We find that these\npeculiar profiles are not due to blue shifted absorption and red shifted\nemission in photoionized ejecta, like the optical P Cyg of novae, but they are\nrather a superposition of WD atmospheric absorption features reflected by the\nalready discovered Thomson scattering corona, and emission lines due to\ncollisional ionization in condensations in the ejecta. On days 23 and 35 the\nabsorption components were no longer measurable, having lost the initial large\nblue shift that displaced them from the core of the broad emission lines.

We propose a novel distributed algorithm where network users determine\nthe coding operations and the packet rates to be requested from the parent\nnodes, such that the decoding delay is minimized for all the clients. A rate\nallocation problem is solved by every user, which seeks the rates that minimize\nthe average decoding delay for its children and for itself.

The SINFONI\nobservations were obtained in 2005 and 2011 and instead probe the [Si I]/[Fe\nII] emission from the inner regions.

The [Si I]/[Fe II] images\ndisplay a more uniform morphology, which may be due to a remaining significant\ncontribution from radioactivity in the inner ejecta and the higher abundance of\nthese elements in the core.

H-alpha, and H-beta\nboth have a centrally peaked component, extending to 4500 km/s and a very broad\ncomponent extending to 11,000 km/s, while the other lines have only the central\ncomponent. The low velocity component comes from unshocked ejecta, heated\nmainly by X-rays from the circumstellar ring collision, whereas the broad\ncomponent comes from faster ejecta passing through the reverse shock. The\nreverse shock flux in H-alpha has increased by a factor of 4-6 from 2000 to\n2007. After that there is a tendency of flattening of the light curve, similar\nto what may be seen in soft X-rays and in the optical lines from the shocked\nring. The core component seen in H-alpha, [Ca II] and Mg II has experienced a\nsimilar increase, consistent with that found from HST photometry. The ring-like\nmorphology of the ejecta is explained as a result of the X-ray illumination,\ndepositing energy outside of the core of the ejecta. The energy deposition in\nthe ejecta of the external X-rays illumination is calculated using explosion\nmodels for SN 1987A and we predict that the outer parts of the unshocked ejecta\nwill continue to brighten because of this.

We propose that\ngenerating functionals allow for a systematic construction of dynamical\nnetworks with well characterized dynamical behavior, such as regular or\nintermittent bursting latching dynamics.\n  Coupling local, slowly adapting variables to an attractor network allows to\ndestabilize all attractors, turning them into attractor ruins. The resulting\nattractor relict network may show ongoing autonomous latching dynamics. We\npropose to use two generating functionals for the construction of attractor\nrelict networks. The first functional is a simple Hopfield energy functional,\nknown to generate a neural attractor network. The second generating functional,\nwhich we denote polyhomeostatic optimization, is based on\ninformation-theoretical principles, encoding the information content of the\nneural firing statistics. Polyhomeostatic optimization destabilizes the\nattractors of the Hopfield network inducing latching dynamics.\n  We investigate the influence of stress, in terms of conflicting optimization\ntargets, on the resulting dynamics. Objective function stress is absent when\nthe target level for the mean of neural activities is identical for the two\ngenerating functionals and the resulting latching dynamics is then found to be\nregular.

The filler structure on large scales up to\nmicrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very\nsmall-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending\nfrom the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius \\approx 10 nm), to\nnanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral\ndimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the\nfraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between the branches of a\nlarge-scale filler network. This network is compatible with a fractal of\naverage dimension 2.4 as measured by scattering. On smaller length scales,\ninside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius\nhas been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for\nall silica fractions investigated here (\\phi_si = 8-21% vol.). A central piece\nof our analysis is the description of the interaggregate interaction by a\nsimulated structure factor for polydisperse spheres representing aggregates. A\npolydispersity of 30% in aggregate size is assumed, and interactions between\nthese aggregates are described with a hard core repulsive potential. The same\ndistribution in size is used to evaluate the polydisperse form factor.\nComparison with the experimental intensity leads to the determination of the\naverage aggregate compacity (assumed identical for all aggregates in the\ndistribution, between 31% and 38% depending on \\phi_si), and thus aggregation\nnumber (ca. 45, with a large spread). Because of the effect of aggregate\ncompacity and of pure polymer zones, the volume fraction of aggregates is\nhigher in the branches than \\phi_si. The repulsion between aggregates has a\nstrong effect on the apparent isothermal compressibility: it leads to a\ncharacteristic low-q depression, which cannot be interpreted as aggregate mass\ndecrease in our data.

The result of heap abstraction,\ntogether with some properties of data structures, can be used to enable program\noptimizations like static deallocation, pool allocation, region-based garbage\ncollection, and object co-location.\n  More precisely, this paper proposes algorithms for abstracting heap\ncomponents with the layout of a singly linked list, a binary tree, a cycle, and\na directed acyclic graph. The termination and correctness of these algorithms\nare studied in the paper. Towards presenting the algorithms the paper also\npresents concrete and abstract models for heap representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 15:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}
