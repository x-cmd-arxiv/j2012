We confirm and document the\n3 year magnetic activity cycle in epsilon Eri originally reported by Hatzes and\ncoworkers, and we examine the archival data from previous observations spanning\n45 years. The data show coexisting 3 year and 13 year periods leading into a\nbroad activity minimum that resembles a Maunder minimum-like state, followed by\nthe resurgence of a coherent 3 year cycle. The nearly continuous activity\nrecord suggests the simultaneous operation of two stellar dynamos with cycle\nperiods of 2.95+/-0.03 years and 12.7+/-0.3 years, which by analogy with the\nsolar case suggests a revised identification of the dynamo mechanisms that are\nresponsible for the so-called \"active\" and \"inactive\" sequences as proposed by\nBohm-Vitense. Finally, based on the observed properties of epsilon Eri we argue\nthat the rotational history of the Sun is what makes it an outlier in the\ncontext of magnetic cycles observed in other stars (as also suggested by its Li\ndepletion), and that a Jovian-mass companion cannot be the universal\nexplanation for the solar peculiarities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 16:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

We resolve this long-standing problem and find that\nHe in the GRB's host HII region is responsible for most of the absorption. We\nshow that the X-ray absorbing column density (N_Hx) is correlated with both the\nneutral gas column density and with the optical afterglow extinction (Av). This\ncorrelation explains the connection between dark bursts and bursts with high\nN_Hx values. From these correlations we exclude an origin of the X-ray\nabsorption which is not related to the host galaxy, i.e. the intergalactic\nmedium or intervening absorbers are not responsible. We find that the\ncorrelation with the dust column has a strong redshift evolution, whereas the\ncorrelation with the neutral gas does not. From this we conclude that the\ncolumn density of the X-ray absorption is correlated with the total gas column\ndensity in the host galaxy rather than the metal column density, in spite of\nthe fact that X-ray absorption is typically dominated by metals. The strong\nredshift evolution of N_Hx/Av is thus a reflection of the cosmic metallicity\nevolution of star-forming galaxies. We conclude that the absorption of X-rays\nin GRB afterglows is caused by He in the HII region hosting the GRB. While dust\nis destroyed and metals are stripped of all of their electrons by the GRB to\ngreat distances, the abundance of He saturates the He-ionising UV continuum\nmuch closer to the GRB, allowing it to remain in the neutral or singly-ionised\nstate.

However,\nlarge-scale systematics can also mimic this signature of non-Gaussianity. In\norder to assess the contribution of systematic effects, we cross-correlate\noverdensity maps of photometric quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) Data Release 6 (DR6) in different redshift ranges.

While at weak coupling V always reduces the spin fluctuations and hence\nd-wave pairing, at strong coupling, in the underdoped regime, the increase of\nJ=4t^2/(U-V) caused by V increases binding at low frequency while the\npair-breaking effect of V is pushed to high frequency. These two effects\ncompensate in the underdoped regime, in the presence of a pseudogap. While the\npseudogap competes with superconductivity, the proximity to the Mott transition\nthat leads to the pseudogap, and retardation effects, protect d-wave\nsuperconductivity from V.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 21:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-09"}

Heiderman infer a threshold by\ncombining low-mass star-forming regions, which show a steep increase in the\nstar formation rate per unit area Sigma_SFR with increasing Sigma, and massive\ncores forming luminous stars which show a linear relation. We argue that these\nobservations do not require a particular density threshold. The steep\ndependence of Sigma_SFR, approaching unity at protostellar core densities, is a\nnatural result of the increasing importance of self-gravity at high densities\nalong with the corresponding decrease in evolutionary timescales. The linear\nbehavior of Sigma_SFR vs. Sigma in massive cores is consistent with probing\ndense gas in gravitational collapse, forming stars at a characteristic\nfree-fall timescale given by the use of a particular molecular tracer. The\nlow-mass and high-mass regions show different correlations between gas surface\ndensity and the area A spanned at that density, with A=Sigma^{-3} for low-mass\nregions and A=Sigma^{-1} for the massive cores; this difference, along with the\nuse of differing techniques to measure gas surface density and star formation,\nsuggests that connecting the low-mass regions with massive cores is\nproblematic. We show that the approximately linear relationship between dense\ngas mass and stellar mass used by Lada similarly does not demand a particular\nthreshold for star formation, and requires continuing formation of dense gas.\nOur results are consistent with molecular clouds forming by galactic\nhydrodynamic flows with subsequent gravitational collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 00:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 17:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Greater accuracy\nwill require incorporation of prior structural information on data into\nlearning. We study methods to regularize feature vectors (unsupervised\nregularization methods), analogous to supervised regularization for estimating\nfunctions in ML. We study regularization (denoising) of ML feature vectors\nusing Tikhonov and other regularization methods for functions on ${\\bf R}^n$. A\nfeature vector ${\\bf x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\{x_q\\}_{q=1}^n$ is viewed as a\nfunction of its index $q$, and smoothed using prior information on its\nstructure.

How does chaos manifest itself in the quantum world? In this spirit,\nwe study the dynamical generation of entanglement as a signature of chaos in a\nsystem of periodically kicked coupled-tops, where chaos and entanglement arise\nfrom the same physical mechanism. The long-time entanglement as a function of\nthe position of an initially localized wave packet very closely correlates with\nthe classical phase space surface of section - it is nearly uniform in the\nchaotic sea, and reproduces the detailed structure of the regular islands. The\nuniform value in the chaotic sea is explained by the random state conjecture.\nAs classically chaotic dynamics take localized distributions in phase space to\nrandom distributions, quantized versions take localized coherent states to\npseudo-random states in Hilbert space. Such random states are highly entangled,\nwith an average value near that of the maximally entangled state. Continuing on\nour journey to find the footprints of chaos in the quantum world, we explore\nquantum signatures of classical chaos by studying the rate of information gain\nin quantum tomography. We find an increase in the rate of information gain and\nhence higher fidelities in the process when the Floquet maps employed increase\nin chaoticity. We make predictions for the information gain using random matrix\ntheory in the fully chaotic regime and show a remarkable agreement between the\ntwo.

It is shown with N-body simulations that during the secular evolution,\nsuch a bulge can gain significant angular momentum emitted by the bar through\nresonant and stochastic orbits.

For the initially rotating small\nclassical bulge, cylindrical rotation in the resulting composite boxy/peanut\nbulge extends to lower heights (Saha & Gerhard 2012).

One major research thrust within the N\\'eel Iram\nKids Array (NIKA) collaboration has been to investigate the suitability of\nthese detectors for deployment at the 30-meter IRAM telescope located on Pico\nVeleta in Spain. Compared to microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKID),\nusing quarter wavelength resonators, the resonant circuit of a LEKID consists\nof a discrete inductance and capacitance coupled to a feedline. A high and\nconstant current density distribution in the inductive part of these resonators\nmakes them very sensitive. Due to only one metal layer on a silicon substrate,\nthe fabrication is relatively easy. In order to optimize the LEKIDs for this\napplication, we have recently probed a wide variety of individual resonator and\narray parameters through simulation and physical testing. This included\ndetermining the optimal feed-line coupling, pixel geometry, resonator\ndistribution within an array (in order to minimize pixel cross-talk), and\nresonator frequency spacing. Based on these results, a 144-pixel Aluminum array\nwas fabricated and tested in a dilution fridge with optical access, yielding an\naverage optical NEP of ~2E-16 W/Hz^1/2 (best pixels showed NEP = 6E-17 W/Hz^1/2\nunder 4-8 pW loading per pixel).

S. Macaulay developped specific techniques for dealing\nwith \" unmixed polynomial ideals \" by introducing what he called \" inverse\nsystems \". The purpose of this paper is to extend such a point of view to\ndifferential modules defined by linear multidimensional systems, that is by\nlinear systems of ordinary differential (OD) or partial differential (PD)\nequations of any order, with any number of independent variables, any number of\nunknowns and even with variable coefficients in a differential field. The first\nand main idea is to replace unmixed polynomial ideals by \" pure differential\nmodules \". The second idea is to notice that a module is 0-pure if and only if\nit is torsion-free and thus if and only if it admits an \" absolute\nparametrization \" by means of arbitrary potential like functions, or,\nequivalently, if it can be embedded into a free module by means of an \"\nabsolute localization \". The third idea is to refer to a difficult theorem of\nalgebraic analysis saying that an r-pure module can be embedded into a module\nof projective dimension equal to r, that is a module admitting a projective\nresolution with exactly r operators. The fourth and final idea is to establish\na link between the use of extension modules for such a purpose and specific\nformal properties of the underlying multidimensional system through the use of\ninvolution and a \"relative localization \" leading to a \"relative\nparametrization \", that is to the use of potential-like functions satisfying a\nkind of \"minimum differential constraint \" limiting, in some sense, the number\nof independent variables appearing in these functions, in a way similar to the\nsituation met in the Cartan-K\\\"ahler theorem of analysis.

However, identifying them\nis difficult, since radio observations commonly have resolutions of between 1\narcsec and 10 arcsec, which is equally sensitive to radio emission from\nstar-forming activity and from AGN. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)\nobservations allow one to filter out all but the most compact non-thermal\nemission from radio survey data. The observational and computational demands to\ndo this in large surveys have been, until recently, too high to make such\nundertakings feasible. Only the recent advent of wide-field observing\ntechniques have facilitated such observations, and we here present the results\nfrom a survey of 217 radio sources in the Lockman Hole/XMM field. We describe\nin detail some new aspects of the calibration, including primary beam\ncorrection, multi-source self-calibration, and mosaicing. As a result, we\ndetected 65 out of the 217 radio sources and were able to construct, for the\nfirst time, the source counts of VLBI-detected AGN. They indicate that at least\n15%-25% of the sub-mJy radio sources are AGN-driven, consistent with recent\nfindings using other AGN selection techniques. We have used ancillary data to\ninvestigate the AGN hosts. We find that among the sources nearby enough to be\nresolved in the optical images, 88% (23/26) could be classified as early-type\nor bulge-dominated galaxies. While 50% of these sources are correctly\nrepresented by the SED of an early-type galaxy, for the rest the best fit was\nobtained with a heavily extinct starburst template, an effect we ascribe to a\ndegeneracy in the fit. Overall, the typical hosts of VLBI-detected sources are\nin good agreement with being early-type or bulge-dominated galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 09:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The\nstar has an ionised wind and using the Br gamma hydrogen recombination emission\nwe assess the mass-loss on spatial scales of order 1 au. We present new VLT\nInterferometer AMBER data which are combined with all other AMBER data in the\nliterature. The final dataset covers a position angle range of 180 degrees and\nbaselines up to 110 meters. The spectrally dispersed visibilities, differential\nphases and line flux are conjointly analyzed and modelled. We also present\nAMBER/FINITO observations which cover a larger wavelength range and allow us to\nobserve the Na I doublet at 2.2 micron. The data are complemented by X-Shooter\ndata, which provide a higher spectral resolution view. The Brackett gamma line\nand the Na I doublet are both spatially resolved. After correcting the AMBER\ndata for the fact that the lines are not spectrally resolved, we find that Br\ngamma traces a ring with a diameter of 4.18 milli-arcseconds. We consider a\ngeometric model in which the Br gamma emission emerges from the top and bottom\nrings of an hour-glass shaped structure, viewed almost pole-on. It provides\nsatisfactory fits to most visibilities and differential phases. The fact that\nwe detect line emission from a neutral metal like Na I within the ionized\nregion, a very unusual occurrence, suggests the presence of a dense\npseudo-photosphere. The ionized wind can be reproduced with a polar wind, which\ncould well have the shape of an hour-glass. The resolved Na I emission is found\nto occur on scales barely larger than the continuum. This fact and that many\nYellow Hypergiants exhibit this comparatively rare emission hints at the\npresence of a \"Yellow\" or even \"White Wall\" in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram,\npreventing them from visibly evolving to the blue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 10:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Therefore, we extend the study of action-dependent channels, which\nuntil now focused on point-to-point models, to multiple-access channels (MAC).\nIn this paper, we consider a two-user, state-dependent MAC, in which one of the\nencoders, called the informed encoder, is allowed to take an action that\naffects the formation of the channel states. Two independent messages are to be\nsent through the channel: a common message known to both encoders and a private\nmessage known only to the informed encoder. In addition, the informed encoder\nhas access to the sequence of channel states in a non-causal manner. Our\nframework generalizes previously evaluated settings of state dependent\npoint-to-point channels with actions and MACs with common messages. We derive a\nsingle letter characterization of the capacity region for this setting. Using\nthis general result, we obtain and compute the capacity region for the Gaussian\naction-dependent MAC. The unique methods used in solving the Gaussian case are\nthen applied to obtain the capacity of the Gaussian action-dependent\npoint-to-point channel; a problem was left open until this work. Finally, we\nestablish some dualities between action-dependent channel coding and source\ncoding problems. Specifically, we obtain a duality between the considered MAC\nsetting and the rate distortion model known as \"Successive Refinement with\nActions\". This is done by developing a set of simple duality principles that\nenable us to successfully evaluate the outcome of one problem given the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 11:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The transmission probability of an h-BN\nbarrier exhibits two unusual behaviors: it is very low also in a classically\nallowed energy region, due to a crystal momentum mismatch between states in\ngraphite and in the dielectric layer, and it is only weakly dependent on energy\nin the h-BN gap, because the imaginary part of the crystal momentum of h-BN is\nalmost independent of energy. The double barrier structures consist of h-BN\nfilms separated by up to three graphene layers. We show that already five\nlayers of h-BN strongly suppress the transmission between graphite leads, and\nthat resonant tunneling cannot be observed because the energy dispersion\nrelation cannot be decoupled in a vertical and a transversal component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 11:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-20"}

I show here that the distribution of the\ndissipated power within a spherically stratified body is a linear combination\nof three angular functions. These angular functions depend only on the tidal\npotential whereas the radial weights are specified by the internal structure of\nthe body. The 3D problem of predicting spatial patterns of dissipation at all\nradii is thus reduced to the 1D problem of computing weight functions. I\ncompute spatial patterns in various toy models without assuming a specific\nrheology: a viscoelastic thin shell stratified in conductive and convective\nlayers, an incompressible homogeneous body and a two-layer model of uniform\ndensity with a liquid or rigid core. For a body in synchronous rotation\nundergoing eccentricity tides, dissipation in a mantle surrounding a liquid\ncore is highest at the poles. Within a softer layer (asthenosphere or icy\nlayer), the same tides generate maximum heating in the equatorial region with a\nsignificant degree-four structure if the layer is thin. Tidal heating patterns\nare thus of three main types: mantle dissipation (including the case of a\nfloating icy crust), dissipation in a thin soft layer and dissipation in a\nthick soft layer. I illustrate the method with applications to Europa, Titan\nand Io. The formalism described in this paper applies to dissipation within\nsolid layers of planets and satellites for which internal spherical symmetry\nand viscoelastic linear rheology are good approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 11:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}

Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and WENO schemes\nallow efficient high-order accuracy while maintaining conservation. Positivity\nlimiters developed by Zhang and Shu ensure a minimum time step for which\npositivity of cell average quantities is maintained without sacrificing\nconservation or formal accuracy; this is achieved by linearly damping the\ndeviation from the cell average just enough to enforce a cell positivity\ncondition that requires positivity at boundary nodes and strategically chosen\ninterior points.\n  We assume that the set of positive states is convex; it follows that\npositivity is equivalent to scalar positivity of a collection of affine\nfunctionals. Based on this observation, we generalize the method of Zhang and\nShu to a framework that we call outflow positivity limiting: First, enforce\npositivity at boundary nodes. If wave speed desingularization is needed, cap\nwave speeds at physically justified maxima by using remapped states to\ncalculate fluxes. Second, apply linear damping again to cap the boundary\naverage of all positivity functionals at the maximum possible (relative to the\ncell average) for a scalar-valued representation positive in each mesh cell.\nThis be done by enforcing positivity of the retentional, an affine combination\nof the cell average and the boundary average, in the same way that Zhang and\nShu would enforce positivity at a single point (and with similar computational\nexpense). Third, limit the time step so that cell outflow is less than the\ninitial cell content. This framework guarantees essentially the same\npositivity-preserving time step as is guaranteed if positivity is enforced at\nevery point in the mesh cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 15:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-20"}

This is done using a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, in the\npresence of long-range Coulomb interactions. For a given electron-electron\ninteraction g and doping level n, we determine whether the total energy is\nminimized for a paramagnetic or ferromagnetic configuration of our variational\nparameters. The g versus n phase diagram is first calculated for the unscreened\ncase. We then include the effects of screening using a simplified expression\nfor the fermion bubble diagram. We show that ferromagnetism in ABC-trilayer\ngraphene is more robust than in monolayer, in bilayer, and in ABA-trilayer\ngraphene. Although the screening reduces the ferromagnetic regime in\nABC-trilayer graphene, the critical doping level remains one order of magnitude\nlarger than in unscreened bilayer graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 15:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

Several\nexperimental sequences were conducted to determine the thermal resistance of\nthe roof according to several parameters and following a specific method. The\nmean method, well known in international standards (ISO 9869 - 1994) for the\ndetermination of the thermal resistance using dynamic data, was used.

The\noriginal setup considers two participating players in a one-shot game competing\nfor a given prize by waiting. This model has later been extended to several\ndifferent models allowing more than two players. One of the first of these\nN-player generalizations was due to J. Haigh and C. Cannings (Acta Appl.\nMath.14) where two possible models are mainly discussed; one in which the game\nstarts afresh with new strategies each time a player leaves the game, and one\nwhere the players have to stick with the strategy they chose initially. The\nfirst case is well understood whereas, for the second case, much is still left\nopen. In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of these two models as the\nnumber of players tend to infinity and prove that their time evolution coincide\nin the limit. We also prove new results concerning the second model in the\nN-player setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 08:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-24"}

The reason for this is\nthe lack of a suitable definition for the term \"information\". In my attempt to\namend this bizarre situation, I have realized that, following the insights of\nKolmogorov's Complexity theory, information can be defined as a description of\nstructures observable in a given data set. Two types of structures could be\neasily distinguished in every data set - in this regard, two types of\ninformation (information descriptions) should be designated: physical\ninformation and semantic information. Kolmogorov's theory also posits that the\ninformation descriptions should be provided as a linguistic text structure.\nThis inevitably leads us to an assertion that information processing has to be\nseen as a kind of text processing. The idea is not new - inspired by the\nobservation that human information processing is deeply rooted in natural\nlanguage handling customs, Lotfi Zadeh and his followers have introduced the\nso-called \"Computing With Words\" paradigm. Despite of promotional efforts, the\nidea is not taking off yet. The reason - a lack of a coherent understanding of\nwhat should be called \"information\", and, as a result, misleading research\nroadmaps and objectives. I hope my humble attempt to clarify these issues would\nbe helpful in avoiding common traps and pitfalls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 05:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-12"}
