However, 4G variations (BSM4) are possible if the new\nparticle is not the SM Higgs boson and/or if other new quanta modify its\nproduction and decay rates. Since LHC searches have pushed 4G quarks to high\nmass and strong coupling where perturbation theory eventually fails, we examine\nthe leading nondecoupling EW (electroweak) corrections at two loop order to\nestimate the domain of validity for perturbation theory. We find that the two\nloop hypercharge correction, which has not been included in previous EW fits of\n4G models, makes the largest quark sector contribution to the rho parameter,\nmuch larger even than the nominally leading one loop term. Because it is large\nand negative, it has a big effect on the EW fits. It does not invalidate\nperturbation theory since it only first appears at two loop order and is large\nbecause it does not vanish for equal quark doublet masses, unlike the one loop\nterm.

We introduce\nan automata model for them which we call ordered-data tree automata (ODTA),\nprovide its logical characterisation, and prove that its non-emptiness problem\nis decidable in 3-NEXPTIME. We also show that the two-variable logic on\nunranked trees, studied by Bojanczyk, Muscholl, Schwentick and Segoufin in\n2009, corresponds precisely to a special subclass of this automata model.\n  Then we define a slightly weaker version of ODTA, which we call weak ODTA,\nand provide its logical characterisation. The complexity of the non-emptiness\nproblem drops to NP. However, a number of existing formalisms and models\nstudied in the literature can be captured already by weak ODTA. We also show\nthat the definition of ODTA can be easily modified, to the case where the data\nvalues come from a tree-like partially ordered domain, such as strings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 18:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2013 15:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-07"}

When the\nU-duality group satisfies certain algebraic conditions, as is the case for a\nbroad class of supergravities, the extremal black holes enjoy a further\nsymmetry known as Freudenthal duality (F-duality), which although distinct from\nU-duality preserves the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Here it is shown that, by\nadopting the doubled Lagrangian formalism, F-duality, defined on the doubled\nfield strengths, is not only a symmetry of the black hole solutions, but also\nof the equations of motion themselves. A further role for F-duality is\nintroduced in the context of world-sheet actions. The Nambu-Goto world-sheet\naction in any (t, s) signature spacetime can be written in terms of the F-dual.\nThe corresponding field equations and Bianchi identities are then related by\nF-duality allowing for an F-dual formulation of Gaillard-Zumino duality on the\nworld-sheet. An equivalent polynomial \"Polyakov- type\" action is introduced\nusing the so-called black hole potential.

This powerful result in turn infers that, while the BCS and the\nfrequentist confidence set for the partially identified parameter are\nasymptotically different, our constructed BCS for the identified set has an\nasymptotically correct frequentist coverage probability. Importantly, we\nillustrate that the constructed BCS for the identified set does not require a\nprior on the structural parameter. It can be computed efficiently for subset\ninference, especially when the target of interest is a sub-vector of the\npartially identified parameter, where projecting to a low-dimensional subset is\noften required. Hence, the proposed methods are useful in many applications.\n  The Bayesian partial identification literature has been assuming a known\nparametric likelihood function. However, econometric models usually only\nidentify a set of moment inequalities, and therefore using an incorrect\nlikelihood function may result in misleading inferences. In contrast, with a\nnonparametric prior on the unknown likelihood function, our proposed Bayesian\nprocedure only requires a set of moment conditions, and can efficiently make\ninference about both the partially identified parameter and its identified set.\nThis makes it widely applicable in general moment inequality models. Finally,\nthe proposed method is illustrated in a financial asset pricing problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 18:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 16:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}

The background image is common to all observed images but undergoes\ngeometric transformations, as the scene is observed from different viewpoints.\nIn this paper, we assume that these geometric transformations are represented\nby a few parameters, e.g., translations, rotations, affine transformations,\netc.. The foreground images differ from one observed image to another, and are\nused to model possible occlusions of the scene. The proposed reconstruction\nalgorithm estimates jointly the images and the transformation parameters from\nthe available multi-view measurements. The ideal solution of this multi-view\nimaging problem minimizes a non-convex functional, and the reconstruction\ntechnique is an alternating descent method built to minimize this functional.\nThe convergence of the proposed algorithm is studied, and conditions under\nwhich the sequence of estimated images and parameters converges to a critical\npoint of the non-convex functional are provided.

The aim of this study is to put observational\nconstraints on the presence of more complex organic and sulfur-bearing\nmolecules predicted to be abundant in chemical models of disks and to simulate\nhigh resolution spectra in view of future missions. High S/N Spitzer spectra at\n10-30 micron of the near edge-on disks IRS46 and GVTau are used to search for\nmid-infrared absorption bands of various molecules. These disks are good\nlaboratories because absorption studies do not suffer from low line/continuum\nratios that plague emission data. Simple LTE slab models are used to infer\ncolumn densities (or upper limits) and excitation temperatures. Bands of HCN,\nC2H2 and CO2 are clearly detected toward both sources. The HCN and C2H2\nabsorption arises in warm gas with Tex of 400-700 K, whereas the CO2 absorption\noriginates in cooler gas of app. 250 K (as in Lahuis 2006). No other absorption\nfeatures are detected. Limits of those molecules are determined and compared\nwith disk models. The inferred ratios wrt.

This interaction relies on strong coupling\nbetween the qubits' transition dipole moments and the vacuum fluctuations of\nthe resonator in the same manner as cavity QED, and has consequently come to be\ncalled \"circuit QED\" (cQED). Great strides in the control of quantum\ninformation have already been made experimentally using this idea. However, the\ncentral role played by photon exchange induced by quantum fluctuations in cQED\ndoes result in some characteristic limitations. In this paper, we discuss an\nalternative method for coupling qubits electromagnetically via a resonator, in\nwhich no photons are exchanged, and where the resonator need not have strong\nquantum fluctuations. Instead, the interaction can be viewed in terms of\nclassical, effective \"forces\" exerted by the qubits on the resonator, and the\nresulting resonator dynamics used to produce qubit entanglement are purely\nclassical in nature. We show how this type of interaction is similar to that\nencountered in the manipulation of atomic ion qubits, and we exploit this\nanalogy to construct two-qubit entangling operations that are largely\ninsensitive to thermal or other noise in the resonator, and to its quality\nfactor. These operations are also extensible to larger numbers of qubits,\nallowing interactions to be selectively generated among any desired subset of\nthose coupled to a single resonator.

We investigate the stable stellar orbits in galactic disks, using the\nnew perturbed potential. The influence of the bulge mass on the stellar orbits\nin the inner regions of a disk is also investigated. The new description offers\nthe advantage of easy control of the parameters of the Gaussian profile of its\npotential. We find a range of values for the perturbation amplitude from 400 to\n800 km^2 s^{-2} kpc^{-1} which implies a maximum ratio of the tangential force\nto the axisymmetric force between 3% and 6%, approximately. Good\nself-consistency of arm shapes is obtained between the Inner Lindblad resonance\n(ILR) and the 4:1 resonance. Near the 4:1 resonance the response density starts\nto deviate from the imposed logarithmic spiral form. This creates bifurcations\nthat appear as short arms. Therefore the deviation from a perfect logarithmic\nspiral in galaxies can be understood as a natural effect of the 4:1 resonance.\nBeyond the 4:1 resonance we find closed orbits which have similarities with the\narms observed in our Galaxy. In regions near the center, in the presence of a\nmassive bulge, elongated stellar orbits appear naturally, without imposing any\nbar-shaped potential, but only extending the spiral perturbation a little\ninward of the ILR. This suggests that a bar is formed with a half-size around 3\nkpc by a mechanism similar to that of the spiral arms. The potential energy\nperturbation that we adopted represents an important step in the direction of\nself-consistency, compared to previous sine function descriptions of the\npotential.

As the approximate error decreases, the computational\ncomplexity grows rapidly, and moreover, the approximate error always exits\nunless the computational region is the full space.

With a suggested spin period of only 67s, it has one of the fastest\nspinning white dwarfs known. To study the spectral variability on the spin\nperiod of the white dwarf, we observed V455 And with 2s integration times,\nwhich is significantly shorter than the spin rate of the white dwarf. To\nachieve this cadence, we used the blue arm of the ISIS spectrograph at the\n4.2-m William Herschel Telescope, equipped with an electron multiplying CCD\n(EMCCD). Strong coherent signals were detected in our time series, which lead\nto a robust determination of the spin period of the white dwarf (Pspin=67.619\n+/- 0.002 s). Folding the spectra on the white dwarf spin period uncovered very\ncomplex emission line variations in Hgamma, He I 4472 and He II 4686. We\nattribute the observed spin phase dependence of the emission line shape to the\npresence of magnetically controlled accretion onto the white dwarf via\naccretion curtains, consistent with an intermediate polar type system. We are,\nhowever, not aware of any specific model that can quantitatively explain the\ncomplex velocity variations we detect in our observations. The orbital\nvariations in the spectral lines indicate that the accretion disc of V455 And\nis rather structureless, contrary to the disc of the prototype of the\nintermediate polars, DQ Her. This work demonstrates the potential of electron\nmultiplying CCDs to observe faint targets at high cadence, as readout noise\nwould make such a study impossible with conventional CCDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass\nof 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens\nresembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent\nwith optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk\ngeometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older\nUpper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin\nlower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk\nluminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting\nand non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar\ndistributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter\ntail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in\nfractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and\nflat disks present wider, overlapping distributions.

Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk\nsurface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics\nor mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation\nfor the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within\ndisks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to\ndistinguish long lasting evolutionary effects.

However, since we are looking at the Galactic center\nthrough the Galactic disk, knowledge of extinction is crucial when studying\nthis region. The Arches cluster is a young, massive starburst cluster near the\nGalactic center. We observed the Arches cluster out to its tidal radius using\nKs-band imaging obtained with NAOS/CONICA at the VLT combined with Subaro/Cisco\nJ-band data to gain a full understanding of the cluster mass distribution. We\nshow that the determination of the mass of the most massive star in the Arches\ncluster, which had been used in previous studies to establish an upper mass\nlimit for the star formation process in the Milky Way, strongly depends on the\nassumed slope of the extinction law. Assuming the two regimes of widely used\ninfrared extinction laws, we show that the difference can reach up to 30% for\nindividually derived stellar masses and Delta AKs ~ 1 magnitude in acquired\nKs-band extinction, while the present-day mass function slope changes by ~ 0.17\ndex.

For this purpose, we use three\ndifferent morphologies for the satellites: pure disc, pure bulge and a mixture\nbulge+disc. Two morphologies are used for the host galaxies: bulge+disc and\npure bulge. We find that while the spheroidal stellar component experiences a\nconstant power-law like mass removal, the disc is exposed to an exponential\nmass loss when the tidal radius of the satellite is of the same order of the\ndisc scale length. This dramatic mass loss is able to completely remove the\nstellar component on time scale of 100 Myears. As a consequence two satellites\nwith the same stellar and dark matter masses, on the same orbit could either\nretain considerable fraction of their stellar mass after 10 Gyrs or being\ncompletely destroyed, depending on their initial stellar morphology. We find\nthat there are two characteristic time scales describing the beginning and the\nend of the disc removal, whose values are related to the size of the disc. This\nresult can be easily incorporated in semi-analytical models. We also find that\nthe host morphology and the orbital parameters also have an effect on the\ndetermining the mass removal, but they are of secondary importance with respect\nto satellite morphology. We conclude that satellite morphology has a very\nstrong effect on the efficiency of stellar stripping and should be taken into\naccount in modeling galaxy formation and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 08:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2013 15:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-01"}

In astrophysical environments,\nsuch turbulence often occurs at high Mach numbers, implying steep slopes in the\nturbulent spectra. It is thus a central question whether the small-scale dynamo\ncan amplify magnetic fields in the interstellar or intergalactic media, where\nsuch Mach numbers occur. To address this long-standing issue, we employ the\nKazantsev model for turbulent magnetic field amplification, systematically\nexploring the effect of different turbulent slopes, as expected for Kolmogorov,\nBurgers, the Larson laws and results derived from numerical simulations. With\nthe framework employed here, we give the first solution encompassing the\ncomplete range of magnetic Prandtl numbers, including Pm << 1, Pm ~ 1 and Pm >>\n1. We derive scaling laws of the growth rate as a function of hydrodynamic and\nmagnetic Reynolds number for Pm << 1 and Pm >> 1 for all types of turbulence. A\ncentral result concerns the regime of Pm ~ 1, where the magnetic field\namplification rate increases rapidly as a function of Pm. This phenomenon\noccurs for all types of turbulence we explored. We further find that the dynamo\ngrowth rate can be decreased by a few orders of magnitude for turbulence\nspectra steeper than Kolmogorov. We calculate the critical magnetic Reynolds\nnumber Rm_c for magnetic field amplification, which is highest for the Burgers\ncase. As expected, our calculation shows a linear behaviour of the\namplification rate close to the threshold proportional to Rm-Rm_c. Based on the\nKazantsev model, we therefore expect the existence of the small-scale dynamo\nfor any given value of Pm, as long as the magnetic Reynolds number is above the\ncritical threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 09:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Using the oPBE-vdW\nfunctional which includes van der Waals forces on an ab initio level, it is\nshown that the molecule has two binding sites, a carboxyl and the hydroxyl\noxygen atoms. Since real chiral surfaces are (i) known to undergo thermal\nroughening that alters the distribution of kinks and step edges but not the\noverall chirality and (ii) kink sites and edge sites are usually the\nenergetically most favored adsorption sites, we focus on two surfaces that\nallow qualitative sampling of the most probable adsorption sites.

The binding energy of the\nmolecule on the chiral surfaces is much higher than on the Pt(111) surface.

Molecular and genomic techniques have revolutionized our knowledge of\nthe molecular ingredients behind this transition but not yet provided a clear\npicture of the morphological and tissue changes involved. Here we focus on a\nbehavioural perspective that centres on movement by muscle contraction.\nBuilding on the finding that molecules for chemical neural signalling predate\nmulticellular animals, we investigate a gradual evolutionary scenario for\nnervous systems that consists of two stages: A) Chemically transmission of\nelectrical activity between adjacent cells provided a primitive form of muscle\ncoordination in a contractile epithelial tissue. B) This primitive form of\ncoordination was subsequently improved upon by evolving the axodendritic\nprocesses of modern neurons. We use computer simulations to investigate the\nfirst stage.

In this paper we\ninitiate the systematic study of quite general powercounting under the\nassumption that color-kinematic duality exists. The main technical tool is a\nreformulation of the duality in terms of linear maps, modulo subtleties at loop\nlevel mostly inherent to the duality. This tool may have wider applications in\nboth gauge and gravity theories, up to resolution of the subtleties. Here it is\nfirst applied to the large Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) shift behavior of\ngravity integrands constructed through the duality. Assuming color-kinematic\nduality and reasonable technical requirements hold these shifts are shown to be\nindependent of loop order, which would imply massive cancellations with respect\nto the Feynman graph expression. More speculatively, the same approach is then\napplied to provide estimates of the overall degree of UV divergence in quite\ngeneral gravity theories, assuming the duality exists. The cancellations\nobtained in these estimates depends on the exact implementation of the duality\nat loop level, especially on graph topology. Finally, some evidence for the\nduality to all loop orders is provided from an analysis of BCFW shifts of gauge\ntheory integrands through Feynman graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 13:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 09:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Their growth becomes reasonable only when starting from\na massive seed black hole with mass of the order of 10^2 - 10^5 M_SUN.\nIntermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are therefore an important field of\nresearch. Especially the possibility of finding them in the centers of globular\nclusters has recently drawn attention. The search for IMBHs in the centers of\nglobular clusters could therefore shed light on the process of black-hole\nformation and cluster evolution. We are investigating six galactic globular\nclusters for the presence of an IMBH at their centers. Based on their kinematic\nand photometric properties, we selected the globular clusters NGC 1851, NGC\n1904 (M79), NGC 5694, NGC 5824, NGC 6093 (M80) and NGC 6266 (M62). We use\nintegral field spectroscopy in order to obtain the central velocity-dispersion\nprofile of each cluster. We compute the cluster photometric center and the\nsurface brightness profile using HST data. After combining these datasets we\ncompare them to analytic Jeans models. We use varying M/L_V profiles for\nclusters with enough data points in order to reproduce their kinematic profiles\nin an optimal way. Finally, we vary the mass of the central black hole and test\nwhether the cluster is better fitted with or without an IMBH. We present the\nstatistical significance, including upper limits, of the black-hole mass for\neach cluster. NGC 1904 and NGC 6266 provide the highest significance for a\nblack hole. Jeans models in combination with a M/L_V profile obtained from\nN-body simulations (in the case of NGC 6266) predict a central black hole of\nM_BH = (3 +- 1) x 10^3 M_SUN for NGC 1904 and M_BH = (2 +- 1) x 10^3 M_SUN for\nNGC 6266. Furthermore, we discuss the possible influence of dark remnants and\nmass segregation at the center of the cluster on the detection of an IMBH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 14:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

These works have allowed users to significantly speed up selective\nMapReduce jobs by orders of magnitude. However, all these proposals require\nusers to create indexes upfront, which might be a difficult task in certain\napplications (such as in scientific and social applications) where workloads\nare evolving or hard to predict. To overcome this problem, we propose LIAH\n(Lazy Indexing and Adaptivity in Hadoop), a parallel, adaptive approach for\nindexing at minimal costs for MapReduce systems. The main idea of LIAH is to\nautomatically and incrementally adapt to users' workloads by creating clustered\nindexes on HDFS data blocks as a byproduct of executing MapReduce jobs. Besides\ndistributing indexing efforts over multiple computing nodes, LIAH also\nparallelises indexing with both map tasks computation and disk I/O. All this\nwithout any additional data copy in main memory and with minimal\nsynchronisation. The beauty of LIAH is that it piggybacks index creation on map\ntasks, which read relevant data from disk to main memory anyways. Hence, LIAH\ndoes not introduce any additional read I/O-costs and exploit free CPU cycles.\nAs a result and in contrast to existing adaptive indexing works, LIAH has a\nvery low (or invisible) indexing overhead, usually for the very first job.\nStill, LIAH can quickly converge to a complete index, i.e. all HDFS data blocks\nare indexed. Especially, LIAH can trade early job runtime improvements with\nfast complete index convergence. We compare LIAH with HAIL, a state-of-the-art\nindexing technique, as well as with standard Hadoop with respect to indexing\noverhead and workload performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 14:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-17"}

The constraint of\ndiffeomorphism invariance is strong enough to uniquely determine the structure\nof the vacuum wave functional in the limit of infinitely fine triangulations of\nthe three-sphere. In the large fluctuation regime the nature of the wave\nfunction solution is such that a physically acceptable ground state emerges,\nwith a finite non-perturbative correlation length naturally cutting off any\ninfrared divergences. The location of the critical point in Newton's constant\n$G_c$, separating the weak from the strong coupling phase, is obtained, and it\nis inferred from the structure of the wave functional that fluctuations in the\ncurvatures become unbounded at this point. Investigations of the vacuum wave\nfunctional further suggest that for weak enough coupling, $G<G_c$, a\npathological ground state with no continuum limit appears, where configurations\nwith small curvature have vanishingly small probability. One is then lead to\nthe conclusion that the weak coupling, perturbative ground state of quantum\ngravity is non-perturbatively unstable, and that gravitational screening cannot\nbe physically realized in the lattice theory.

When the system is a solution of a single species of\nparticles, the lack of at least one mirror plane of symmetry leads to the\nfamiliar requirement of chirality of the individual particle. With respect to\nhelicity preservation, according to the analytical and numerical evidence\npresented in this paper, the solution preserves helicity if and only if the\nindividual particle itself preserves helicity. However, only in the particular\ncase of forward scattering the helicity preservation condition on the particle\nis relaxed: We show that the random orientation of the molecules endows the\nsolution with an effective rotational symmetry; at its turn, this leads to\nhelicity preservation in the forward scattering direction independently of any\nproperty of the particle. This is not the case for a general scattering\ndirection. These results advance the current understanding of the phenomena of\nmolecular optical activity and provide insight for the design of polarisation\ncontrol devices at the nanoscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2012 23:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 May 2013 00:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-12"}

Euler numbers $E_{p-3}$ first appeared in H. S.\nVandiver's work (1940) in connection with the first case of Fermat Last\nTheorem. Vandiver proved that $x^p+y^p=z^p$ has no solution for integers\n$x,y,z$ with $\\gcd(xyz,p)=1$ if $E_{p-3}\\equiv 0 (\\bmod p)$. Numerous\ncombinatorial congruences recently obtained by Z.-W. Sun and by Z.-H. Sun\ninvolve the Euler numbers $E_{p-3}$. This gives a new significance to the\nprimes $p$ for which $E_{p-3}\\equiv 0 (\\bmod p)$.\n  For the computation of residues of Euler numbers $E_{p-3}$ modulo a prime\n$p$, we use the congruence which runs significantly faster than other known\ncongruences involving $E_{p-3}$. Applying this congruence, a computation via\n{\\tt Mathematica 8} shows that only three primes less than $10^7$ satisfy the\ncondition $E_{p-3}\\equiv 0 (\\bmod p)$ (such primes are 149, 241 and 2946901,\nand they are given as a Sloane's sequence A198245). By using related\ncomputational results and statistical considerations similar to those on search\nfor Wieferich and Fibonacci-Wieferich and Wolstenholme primes, we conjecture\nthat there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $E_{p-3}\\equiv 0 (\\bmod\np)$. Moreover, we propose a conjecture on the asymptotic estimate of number of\nprimes $p$ in an interval $[x,y]$ such that $E_{p-3}\\equiv A (\\bmod p)$ for\nsome integer $A$ with $|A|\\in [K,L]$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Dec 2012 00:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-10"}

In the ISR, there is no need either for the\nchange of the Lorentz force, but as a 4D GQ, or for the introduction of some\n\"hidden\" 3D quantities. Furthermore, in the ISR, contrary to all previous\napproaches, an electrically neutral current-loop in its rest frame possesses\nnot only a MDM m, but also an electric dipole moment (EDM) p and a stationary\npermanent magnet possesses not only an intrinsic magnetization M but also an\nintrinsic electric polarization P. Hence, in a static electric field, both, a\ncurrent-loop and a permanent magnet experience the Lorentz force K_{L} and the\ntorque N in all relatively moving inertial frames.
