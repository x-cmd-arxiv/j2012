The resulting systems of finite-difference\nequations are solved by different preconditioned Krylov subspace-based methods.\nIn the majority of test problems, the preconditioned Generalized Minimal\nResidual (GMRES) method is the superior choice, but in the case of sufficiently\nfine grids a simple stationary two-level algorithm proposed in this paper in\ncombination with a lower order approximation preconditioner presents an\nefficient alternative to the GMRES method.

This model is expected to\nprovide a good description of a mass-imbalanced cold fermionic mixture in a 3D\noptical lattice. We use the dynamical mean field theory to study various\nphysical properties of this system. In particular, we show how\norbital-selective physics, observed in multi-orbital strongly correlated\nelectron systems, can be realized in such a simple model. We find that the\ndensity distribution is a good probe of this orbital selective crossover from a\nFermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid state.\n  Below an ordering temperature $T_o$, which is a function of both the\ninteraction and hopping asymmetry, the system exhibits staggered long range\norbital order. Apart from the special case of the symmetric limit, i.e.,\nHubbard model, where there is no hopping asymmetry, this orbital order is\naccompanied by a true charge density wave order for all values of the hopping\nasymmetry. We calculate the order parameters and various physical quantities\nincluding the thermodynamics in both the ordered and disordered phases. We find\nthat the formation of the charge density wave is signaled by an abrupt increase\nin the sublattice double occupancies. Finally, we propose a new method,\nentropic chromatography, for cooling fermionic atoms in optical lattices, by\nexploiting the properties of the AHM. To establish this cooling strategy on a\nfirmer basis, we also discuss the variations in temperature induced by the\nadiabatic tuning of interactions and hopping parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 18:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Yet, magnetic fields have typically\nbeen neglected in studies of the formation of galaxies, leaving their global\ninfluence on galaxy formation largely unclear. We extend our MHD implementation\nin the moving-mesh code Arepo to cosmological problems which include radiative\ncooling and the formation of stars. In particular, we replace our previously\nemployed divergence cleaning approach with a Powell 8-wave scheme, which turns\nout to be significantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. We\nverify the improved accuracy through simulations of the MRI in accretion disks,\nthat reproduce its correct linear growth rate. Using this new MHD code, we\nsimulate the formation of isolated disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way using\nidealized initial conditions with and without magnetic fields. We find that the\nmagnetic field is quickly amplified in the initial starburst and the\ndifferential rotation of the forming disk until it eventually saturates when it\nbecomes comparable to the thermal pressure. The additional pressure component\nleads to a lower star formation rate at late times compared to simulations\nwithout magnetic fields, and induces changes in the spiral arm structures of\nthe gas disk. In addition, we observe highly magnetized fountain-like outflows\nfrom the disk. These results are robust with numerical resolution and are\nlargely independent of the initial magnetic seed field assumed in the initial\nconditions, as the amplification process is rapid and self-regulated. Our\nfindings suggest an important influence of magnetic fields on galaxy formation\nand evolution, cautioning against their neglect in theoretical models of\nstructure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

We report on Swift and XMM-Newton\nobservations of the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1709-267,\nwhich were made in 2012 September-October when it transitioned to quiescence\nafter a ~10-week long accretion outburst.

A new fast method, called MAMPOSSt, which performs a maximum\nlikelihood fit of the distribution of observed tracers in projected phase\nspace, is developed and thoroughly tested. MAMPOSSt assumes a shape for the\ngravitational potential, but instead of postulating a shape for the\ndistribution function in terms of energy and angular momentum, or supposing\nGaussian line-of-sight velocity distributions, MAMPOSSt assumes a VA profile\nand a shape for the 3D velocity distribution, here Gaussian. MAMPOSSt requires\nno binning, differentiation, nor extrapolation of the observables. Tests on\ncluster-mass haloes from LambdaCDM cosmological simulations show that, with 500\ntracers, MAMPOSSt is able to jointly recover the virial radius, tracer scale\nradius, dark matter scale radius and outer or constant VA with small bias (<10%\non scale radii and <2% on the two other quantities) and inefficiencies of 10%,\n27%, 48% and 20%, respectively. MAMPOSSt does not perform better when some\nparameters are frozen, and even worse when the virial radius is set to its true\nvalue, which appears to be the consequence of halo triaxiality.

For a galaxy\nwith a flat rotation curve and an ISM disk having a constant Toomre stability\nparameter, Q, the ISM surface mass density Sigma_g as well as Sigma_M both fall\noff as 1/R. We use published data on a sample of 20 well studied galaxies to\nshow that ISM disks do maintain a constant Q over radii usually encompassing\nmore than 50% of the HI mass. The power law slope in Sigma_g covers a range of\nexponents and is well correlated with the slope in the epicyclic frequency.\nThis implies that the ISM disk is responding to the potential, and hence that\nsecular evolution is important for setting the structure of ISM disks. We show\nthat the gas to total mass ratio should be anti-correlated with the maximum\nrotational velocity, and that the sample falls on the expected relationship.

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun. In such clusters, supernovae\nand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal\nof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex\nchemical enrichment history.\n  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto\nstellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington\napproximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our\nresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing\non the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio. In particular, we show\nthat an increase of the upper mass cut-off with decreasing metallicity could\ncontribute to the observed anti-correlation between the mass-to-light ratio and\nthe metallicity of GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measured the integrated gas\nmass-loss rate across asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants\n(RSGs) in the SMC, and obtained a rate of 1.4x10^-3 Msun yr-1. This is much\nsmaller than the estimated gas ejection rate from type II supernovae (SNe)\n(2-4x10^-2 Msun yr-1). The SMC underwent a an increase in starformation rate in\nthe last 12 Myrs, and consequently the galaxy has a relatively high SN rate at\npresent. Thus, SNe are more important gas sources than AGB stars in the SMC.\nThe total gas input from stellar sources into the ISM is 2-4x10^-2 Msun yr-1.\nThis is slightly smaller than the ISM gas consumed by starformation (~8x10^-2\nMsun yr-1). Starformation in the SMC relies on a gas reservoir in the ISM, but\neventually the starformation rate will decline in this galaxy, unless gas\ninfalls into the ISM from an external source. The dust injection rate from AGB\nand RSG candidates is 1x10^-5 Msun yr-1. Dust injection from SNe is in the\nrange of 0.2--11x10^-4 Msun yr-1, although the SN contribution is rather\nuncertain.

Most current ABC algorithms directly approximate the\nposterior distribution, but an alternative, less common strategy is to\napproximate the likelihood function. This has several advantages. First, in\nsome problems, it is easier to approximate the likelihood than to approximate\nthe posterior. Second, an approximation to the likelihood allows reference\nanalyses to be constructed based solely on the likelihood. Third, it is\nstraightforward to perform sensitivity analyses for several different choices\nof prior once an approximation to the likelihood is constructed, which needs to\nbe done only once. The contribution of the present paper is to consider\nregression density estimation techniques to approximate the likelihood in the\nABC setting. Our likelihood approximations build on recently developed marginal\nadaptation density estimators by extending them for conditional density\nestimation. Our approach facilitates reference Bayesian inference, as well as\nfrequentist inference.

More\nspecifically, we address systems where the Gaussian approximation fails, i.e.\nthe sole knowledge of the spectrum is not enough to determine the dynamics of\nquantum correlations. We thus investigate the dynamics for two different\nconfigurations of the environment: in the first case the noise spectrum is due\nto the interaction of each qubit with a single bistable fluctuator with an\nundetermined switching rate, whereas in the second case we consider a\ncollection of classical fluctuators with fixed switching rates.

The environmental noise is introduced by means of\nstochastic time-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian and this allows us to\ndescribe the effects of both separate and common environments.

In particular,\ndepending on the characteristics of the environmental noise considered, both\nentanglement and discord display either a monotonic decay or the phenomena of\nsudden death and revivals.

Energy injection into the relativistic blast-wave\nenergizing the burst ambient medium has been proposed most often to be the\nreason for the X-ray afterglow complexity. We examine 117 light-curve breaks of\n98 Swift X-ray afterglows, selected for their high-quality monitoring and\nwell-constrained flux decay rates. Thirty percent of afterglows have a break\nthat can be an adiabatic jet-break, in the sense that there is one variant of\nthe forward-shock emission from a collimated outflow model that can account for\nboth the pre- and post-break flux power-law decay indices, given the measured\nX-ray spectral slope. If allowance is made for a steady energy injection into\nthe forward-shock, then another 56 percent of X-ray afterglows have a\nlight-curve break that can be explained with a jet-break. The remaining 12\npercent that are not jet-breaks, as well as the existence of two breaks in 19\nafterglows (out of which only one can be a jet-break), suggest that some X-ray\nbreaks arise from a sudden change in the rate at which energy is added to the\nblast-wave, and it may well be that a larger fraction of X-ray light-curve\nbreaks are generated by that mechanism. To test the above two mechanisms for\nafterglow light-curve breaks, we derive comprehensive analytical results for\nthe dynamics of outflows undergoing energy injection and for their\nlight-curves, including closure relations for inverse-Compton afterglows and\nfor the emission from spreading jets interacting with an wind-like ambient\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 22:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

When the mass is located\nin the range of $\\sim$1.7 - 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$, the mixing caused by rotationally\ninduced instabilities is not efficient; the hydrostatic effects dominate the\neffect on the evolution of these stars. For the models with masses between\nabout 1.6 and 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$, rotating models always exhibit lower effective\ntemperatures than non-rotating ones at the same age during the MS stage. For a\ngiven age, the lower the mass, the smaller the change in the effective\ntemperature. Thus rotations could lead to a color spread near the MS turnoff in\nthe color-magnitude diagram for the intermediate-age star clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 00:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Hydrogen evolution\nreaction (HER) can be easily achieved from water if a voltage above the\nthermodynamic potential of the HER is applied. Large overpotentials are\nenergetically inefficient but can be lowered with expensive platinum based\ncatalysts. Replacement of Pt with inexpensive, earth abundant electrocatalysts\nwould be significantly beneficial for clean and efficient hydrogen evolution.\nTowards this end, promising HER characteristics have been reported using 2H\n(trigonal prismatic) XS2 (where X = Mo or W) nanoparticles with a high\nconcentration of metallic edges as electrocatalysts. The key challenges for HER\nwith XS2 are increasing the number and catalytic activity of active sites. Here\nwe report atomically thin nanosheets of chemically exfoliated WS2 as efficient\ncatalysts for hydrogen evolution with very low overpotentials.\nAtomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy analyses\nindicate that enhanced electrocatalytic activity of WS2 is associated with high\nconcentration of strained metallic 1T (octahedral) phase in the as-exfoliated\nnanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of\nstrain in the 1T phase leads to an enhancement of the density of states at the\nFermi level and increases the catalytic activity of the WS2 nanosheet.

All superoutbursts in\nV1504 Cyg have turned out to be of the precursor-main type and the superhump\nfirst appears near the maximum of the precursor. The superhumps grow smoothly\nfrom the precursor to the main superoutburst showing that the superoutburst is\ninitiated by the tidal instability (as evidenced by growing superhump) as\nenvisioned in the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model proposed by Osaki\n(1989). We have performed power spectral analysis of the light curve of V1504\nCyg. One of outstanding features is an appearance of a negative superhump\nextending for around 300 d, well over a supercycle. We have found that an\nappearance of the negative superhump tends to reduce the frequency of\noccurrence of normal outbursts. Two types of supercycles are recognized in\nV1504 Cyg, which are similar to those of the Type L and S supercycles in the\nlight curve of VW Hyi, a prototype SU UMa star, introduced by Smak (1985). It\nis found that the Type L supercycle is the one accompanied with the negative\nsuperhump and the Type S is that without the negative superhump. If we adopt a\ntilted disk as an origin of the negative superhump, two types of the\nsupercycles are understood to be due to a difference in outburst intervals,\nwhich is in turn caused by a difference in mass supply from the secondary to\ndifferent parts of the disk. The frequency of the negative superhump varies\nsystematically during a supercycle in V1504 Cyg. This variation can be used as\nan indicator of the disk radius variation and we have found that observed disk\nradius variation in V1504 Cyg fits very well with a prediction of the TTI\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 01:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 02:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 May 2013 08:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The surface density\ndistribution of all the 2MASS sources with certain detection toward IC 1396\nindicates the existence of a compact cluster spatially consistent with the\nposition of the exciting source of the H II region, HD 206267. The spatial\ndistribution of the infrared excessive emission sources selected based on\narchived 2MASS data reveals the existence of four sub-clusters in this region.\nOne is in association with the open cluster Trumpler 37. The other three are\nfound to be spatially coincident with the bright rims of the H II region. All\nthe excessive emission sources in the near infrared are cross-identified with\nthe AKARI IRC data, an analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of\nthe resultant sample leads to the identification of 8 CLASS I, 15 CLASS II and\n15 CLASS III sources in IC 1396. Optical identification of the sample sources\nwith R magnitudes brighter than 17 mag corroborates the results from the SED\nanalysis. Based on the spatial distribution of the infrared young stellar\nobjects at different evolutionary stages, the surrounding sub-clusters located\nin the bright rims are believed to be younger than the central one. This is\nconsistent with a scenario of sequential star formation in this region. Imaging\ndata of a dark patch in IC 1396 by Herschel SPIRE, on the other hand, indicate\nthe presence of two far-infrared cores in LDN 1111, which are likely new\ngeneration protostellar objects in formation. So we infer that the star\nformation process in this H II region was not continuous but episodic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 05:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Degeneracies in physical and biological systems\ncan be lifted by external perturbations thus allowing degenerate systems to\nexhibit a wide range of behaviors. Here we show that the degeneracy of the\ngenetic code is lifted by environmental perturbations to regulate protein\nlevels in living cells. By measuring protein synthesis rates from a synthetic\nreporter library in Escherichia coli, we find that environmental perturbations,\nsuch as reduction of cognate amino acid supply, lift the degeneracy of the\ngenetic code by splitting codon families into a hierarchy of robust and\nsensitive synonymous codons. Rates of protein synthesis associated with robust\ncodons are up to hundred-fold higher than those associated with sensitive\ncodons under these conditions. We find that the observed hierarchy between\nsynonymous codons is not determined by usual rules associated with tRNA\nabundance and codon usage. Rather, competition among tRNA isoacceptors for\naminoacylation underlies the robustness of protein synthesis. Remarkably, the\nhierarchy established using the synthetic library also explains the measured\nrobustness of synthesis for endogenous proteins in E. coli. We further found\nthat the same hierarchy is reflected in the fitness cost of synonymous\nmutations in amino acid biosynthesis genes and in the transcriptional control\nof sigma factor genes. Our study reveals that the degeneracy of the genetic\ncode can be lifted by environmental perturbations, and it suggests that\norganisms can exploit degeneracy lifting as a general strategy to adapt protein\nsynthesis to their environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 06:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

Stellar flybys may affect the orbital\narchitecture of the systems by exciting the eccentricity and causing dynamical\ninstability. Since, incidentally, the timescale over which a cluster loses its\ngaseous component and begins to disperse is comparable to the circumstellar\ndisk lifetime, we expect that closer, and more perturbing, stellar flybys occur\nwhen the planets are still embedded in their birth disk. We investigate the\neffects of the disk on the dynamics of planets after the stellar encounter to\ntest whether it can damp the eccentricity and return the planetary system to a\nnon-excited state. We use the hydrodynamical code FARGO to study the\ndisk+planet(s) system during and after the stellar encounter in the context of\nevolved disk models whose superficial density is 10 times lower than that of\nthe Minimum Mass Solar Nebula. The numerical simulations show that the planet\neccentricity, excited during a close stellar flyby, is damped on a short\ntimescale (~ 10 Kyr) in spite of the disk low initial density and subsequent\ntidal truncation. This damping is effective also for a system of 3 giant\nplanets and the effects of the dynamical instability induced by the passing\nstar are quickly absorbed. If the circumstellar disk is still present around\nthe star during a stellar flyby, a planet (or a planetary system) is returned\nto a non-excited state on a short timescale. This does not mean that stellar\nencounters do not affect the evolution of planets, but they do it in a subtle\nway with a short period of agitated dynamical evolution.

This\nformulation is in parallel with the standard time-independent\nRayleigh-Schr{\\\"o}dinger perturbation theory. The efficiency of the method is\ntested by comparing the perturbative values against the numerically calculated\neigenvalues for spheroidal, superegg and superquadric shaped boundaries. It is\nshown that this perturbation works quite well even for wide departure from\nspherical shape and for higher excited states too. We believe this formulation\nwould find applications in the field of quantum dots and acoustical cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 09:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-10"}

Using the 1-0 S(1)/2-1 S(1) line ratio as well as\nseveral other H_2 line ratios and the morphological comparison between H_2 and\nBr\\gamma and [FeII], we find that excitation from UV photons is the dominant\nexcitation mechanisms throughout NGC 253.

When suitably positioned,\nthough, these traps can, surprisingly, render the search process much more\nefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 13:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-10"}

Today, this is particularly important in view of the\n\"liberalization\" brought in by the Linux OS which offers several variants of\nTCP congestion control. In particular, we consider four TCP variants: 1) TCP\nNewReno, which is the only congestion control standardized by the IETF; 2) TCP\nBIC, that was, and 3) TCP Cubic that is the default algorithm in the Linux OS;\n4) Westwood+ TCP that has been shown to be particularly effective over wireless\nlinks. Main results are that all the TCP variants provide comparable goodputs\nbut with significant larger round trip times and number of retransmissions and\ntimeouts in the case of TCP BIC/Cubic, which is a consequence of their more\naggressive probing phases. On the other hand, TCP Westwood+ provides the\nshortest round trip delays, which is an effect of its unique way of setting\ncontrol windows after congestion episode based on bandwidth measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 14:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-10"}

The\nentropy of the system must obey the lowest bound. If the bounds are\nproportional, the result is the proportionality between the mass M of the\nsystem and its effective size $R$. When the constant of proportionality is\n$2G/c^2$ the system in question is a BH, and the two bounds are identical. We\nanalyze the case for a universe. Then the universe is a BH in the sense that\nits mass $M$ and its Hubble size $R \\approx ct$, t the age of the universe,\nfollow the Schwarzschild relation $2GM/c^2 = R$. Finally, for a BH, the Hawking\nand Unruh temperatures are the same. Applying this to a universe they define\nthe quantum of mass $\\sim 10^{-66} g$ for our universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Dec 2012 22:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}
