Two of these---the multidimensional special\nrelativistic case, and a conformally flat formulation of the spherically\nsymmetric general relativistic case---are given in appendices for the sake of\ncomparison with extant literature.

In the first project, we present a\nsoftware that analyses RNA secondary structures and compares them. The goal of\nthis software is to find the differences between two secondary structures\n(experimental or predicted) in order to improve or compare algorithms for\npredicting secondary structures. Then, a comparison between secondary\nstructures predicted by the Vienna package to those found experimentally is\npresented and cases in which there exists a difference between the prediction\nand the experimental structure are identified. As the differences originate\nmainly from faces and hydrogen bonds that are not allowed by the Vienna\npackage, it is suggested that prediction may be improved by integrating them\ninto the software. In the second project we calculate the free energy of an\ninterior loop using Monte-Carlo simulation. We first present a semi-coarse\ngrained model for interior loops of RNA, and the energy model for the different\ninteractions. We then introduce the Monte-Carlo simulations and the method of\nParallel Tempering which enables good sampling of configuration space by\nsimulating a system simultaneously at several temperatures. Next we present\nThermodynamic Integration, which is a method for calculating free energy\ndifferences. Then, We introduce a method that calculates the free energy\nsignificantly faster since we need to use only one parameter, $T$. To implement\nthis method, we had to reach a regime in which the partition functions of the\ntwo systems are equal, which isn't satisfied for systems that have different\nentropies in the high temperature limit, so a solution to this problem had to\nbe found. Free energy values calculated for various interior loops are shown,\nand may, if verified or with a more realistic modelling, be integrated into the\nVienna package and supply an alternative to the experiments done.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 17:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

In contrast to CSW, we explicitly include the normalization of\nprobabilities, which gives us a much finer control over the various sets of\nprobabilistic models like classical, quantum and generalized probabilistic. In\nparticular, our framework specializes to (quantum) nonlocality in the case of\nBell scenarios, which arise very naturally from a certain product of\ncontextuality scenarios due to Foulis and Randall.

Consequently, the glow discharge, the\ntarget poisoning, and hence the morphology, crystal structure and stoichiometry\nof the prepared thin films are influenced. Therefore, these effects were\ninvestigated by varying the cathode current Im between 0.50 and 1.00 A, the\nmagnetic field strength B between 45 and 90 mT, and the O2/(Ar+O2) flow rate\nratio between 0 and 100%.

These two transition zones (from Ta to TaOx and from\nTaOx to Ta2O5) shift to higher oxygen flow rates for increasing target\ncurrents. Contrary, increasing the magnetic field strength (e.g., due to\nsputter erosion) mainly shifts the TaOx to Ta2O5 transition to lower oxygen\nflow rates while marginally influencing the Ta to TaOx transition. To allow for\na stable DC glow discharge (and to suppress the formation of non-conductive\nTa2O5 at the target) even at a flow rate ratio of 100% either a high target\ncurrent (Im >= 1 A) or a low magnetic field strength (B <= 60 mT) is necessary.\nThese conditions are required to prepare stoichiometric and fully crystalline\nTa2O5 films.

Such epistatic interactions among loci are now\nrecognized as fundamental to shaping the process of adaptation in evolving\npopulations. Although little is known about the structure of epistasis in most\norganisms, recent experiments with bacterial populations have concluded that\nantagonistic interactions abound and tend to de-accelerate the pace of\nadaptation over time. Here, we use a broad class of mathematical fitness\nlandscapes to examine how natural selection biases the mutations that\nsubstitute during evolution based on their epistatic interactions. We find\nthat, even when beneficial mutations are rare, these biases are strong and\nchange substantially throughout the course of adaptation. In particular,\nepistasis is less prevalent than the neutral expectation early in adaptation\nand much more prevalent later, with a concomitant shift from predominantly\nantagonistic interactions early in adaptation to synergistic and sign epistasis\nlater in adaptation. We observe the same patterns when re-analyzing data from a\nrecent microbial evolution experiment. Since these biases depend on the\npopulation size and other parameters, they must be quantified before we can\nhope to use experimental data to infer an organism's underlying fitness\nlandscape or to understand the role of epistasis in shaping its adaptation. In\nparticular, we show that when the order of substitutions is not known to an\nexperimentalist, then standard methods of analysis may suggest that epistasis\nretards adaptation when in fact it accelerates it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 19:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-18"}

One key observational\nresult of the last years is that massive galaxies increased their size by a\nfactor of a few at fixed stellar mass from $z\\sim2$. Hierarchical models favor\nminor mergers as a plausible driver of this size growth. Some of these models,\npredict a significant environmental dependence in the sense that galaxies\nresiding in more massive halos tend to be larger than galaxies in lower mass\nhalos, at fixed stellar mass and redshift. At present, observational results of\nthis environmental dependence have been contradictory. In this paper we revisit\nthis issue in the local Universe, by investigating how the sizes of massive\nETGs depend on large-scale environment using an updated and accurate sample of\nETGs in different environments - field, group, clusters - from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey DR7. Our analysis does not show any significant\nenvironmental dependence of the sizes of central and satellites ETGs at fixed\nstellar mass at $z\\sim0$. The size-mass relation of early-type galaxies at\n$z\\sim0$ seems to be universal, i.e., independent of the mass of the host halo\nand of the position of the galaxy in that halo (central or satellite). The\nresult is robust to different galaxy selections based on star formation,\nmorphology or central density. In fact, considering our observational errors\nand the size of the sample, any size ratio larger than $30-40%$ between massive\ngalaxies ($log(M_*/M_\\odot)>11$) living in clusters and in the field can be\nruled out at $3\\sigma$ level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 12:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Thanks to the strong absorption\nlines of Sr, they can be detected even in the most metal-poor stars and also in\nlow-resolution spectra. However, we still cannot explain the large star-to-star\nabundance scatter we derive for metal-poor stars. Here we contrast Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) with improved abundances for SrI+II including updated\natomic data, to evaluate possible explanations for the large star-to-star\nscatter at low metallicities. We derive abundances under both local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE (NLTE) for stars spanning a large\ninterval of stellar parameters.

SrII is a good tracer under both LTE and NLTE (down to [Fe/H]\\sim\n-3), and LTE is a safe assumption for this majority species.

Interior to 3.5 kpc, the effects of\nthe Galactic bulge cannot be neglected and the in-plane tidal components are as\nimportant as the vertical ones.

An X-ray observation was carried out with the\nXMM-Newton satellite to constrain the properties of the pulsar and its nebula.\nThe absorption column density derived in X-rays from the pulsar and from\ndifferent regions of the rim of the SNR was compared with the absorption\nderived from the atomic (HI) and molecular (12CO) gas distribution along the\ncorresponding lines of sight to estimate the distance of the pulsar and of the\nSNR.\n  The observation has revealed the X-ray counterpart of the pulsar together\nwith surrounding extended emission thus confirming the existence of a PWN. The\ncomparison of column densities provided an upper limit to the distance of the\npulsar PSR J0855-4644 and the SNR RX J0852.0-4622 (d<900 pc). Although both\nobjects are at compatible distances, we rule out that the pulsar and the SNR\nare associated. With this revised distance, PSR J0855-4644 is the second most\nenergetic pulsar, after the Vela pulsar, within a radius of 1 kpc and could\ntherefore contribute to the local cosmic-ray e-/e+ spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It is put to an important experimental test by\nmaking a high precision measurement of the proposed molecule's binding energy.\nUsing 818 pb-1 of e+e- annihilation data taken with the CLEO-c detector at\npsi(3770), the decays D0 -> KS K+ K- and D^0(Dbar0) -> K+- pi-+ pi+ pi- have\nbeen studied to make the highest precision measurement of D0 mass,\nM(D0)=1864.851+-0.020+-0.019+-0.054 MeV/c^2, where the first error is\nstatistical, the second error is systematic, and the third error is due to\nuncertainty in kaon masses, or 1864.851+-0.061 MeV/c^2 with all errors added in\nquadrature. This leads to M(D0 + D*0)=3871.822+-0.140 MeV/c^2, and the binding\nenergy BE(X(3872)) = M(D0+D*0)-M(X(3872)) = +142+-220 keV. At the 90%\nconfidence level this leads to the conclusion that X(3872) is either unbound by\nas much as 140 keV, or it is bound by less than 420 keV. If bound, X(3872) has\na very large radius; the central value of binding energy corresponds to a\nradius of 12 fm, and the lower limit to 7 fm, both being uncomfortably large\nfor a molecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Dec 2012 23:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-19"}

If the infection strength is higher than a\ncertain threshold -- which we define as the epidemic threshold - then the\nepidemic spreads through the population and persists in the long run. For a\nsingle generic graph representing the contact network of the population under\nconsideration, the epidemic threshold turns out to be equal to the inverse of\nthe spectral radius of the contact graph. However, in a real world scenario it\nis not possible to isolate a population completely: there is always some\ninterconnection with another network, which partially overlaps with the contact\nnetwork. Results for epidemic threshold in interconnected networks are limited\nto homogeneous mixing populations and degree distribution arguments. In this\npaper, we adopt a spectral approach. We show how the epidemic threshold in a\ngiven network changes as a result of being coupled with another network with\nfixed infection strength. In our model, the contact network and the\ninterconnections are generic. Using bifurcation theory and algebraic graph\ntheory, we rigorously derive the epidemic threshold in interconnected networks.\nThese results have implications for the broad field of epidemic modeling and\ncontrol.

But straightforward forms of the most favored model, in which\nX-rays arise from instability-generated shocks embedded in the stellar wind,\npredict a steeper scaling, either with mass loss rate Lx ~ Mdot ~ Lbol^{1.7} if\nthe shocks are radiative, or with Lx ~ Mdot^{2} ~ Lbol^{3.4} if they are\nadiabatic. This paper presents a generalized formalism that bridges these\nradiative vs. adiabatic limits in terms of the ratio of the shock cooling\nlength to the local radius. Noting that the thin-shell instability of radiative\nshocks should lead to extensive mixing of hot and cool material, we propose\nthat the associated softening and weakening of the X-ray emission can be\nparametrized as scaling with the cooling length ratio raised to a power m$, the\n\"mixing exponent\". For physically reasonable values m ~= 0.4, this leads to an\nX-ray luminosity Lx ~ Mdot^{0.6} ~ Lbol that matches the empirical scaling. To\nfit observed X-ray line profiles, we find such radiative-shock-mixing models\nrequire the number of shocks to drop sharply above the initial shock onset\nradius. This in turn implies that the X-ray luminosity should saturate and even\ndecrease for optically thick winds with very high mass-loss rates. In the\nopposite limit of adiabatic shocks in low-density winds (e.g., from B-stars),\nthe X-ray luminosity should drop steeply with Mdot^2. Future numerical\nsimulation studies will be needed to test the general thin-shell mixing ansatz\nfor X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 06:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The subsequent formulation of appropriate\nboundary conditions leads to a set of admissible values for $\\Lambda$,\nconsidered as eigenvalues of the corresponding linear operator. Simplest\nboundary conditions are assumed, namely that the eigenfunctions belong to $L^2$\nspace, with the result that, when all energy conditions are satisfied, they\nyield a discrete spectrum for $\\Lambda>0$ and a continuous one for $\\Lambda<0$.\nA very interesting situation is seen to occur when the discrete spectrum\ncontains only one point: then, there is the possibility to obtain appropriate\ncosmological conditions without invoking the anthropic principle.

We show that the prediction can be quite accurate, matching the\nactual speedups very well up to 100 parallel cores and then with a deviation of\nabout 20% up to 256 cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 10:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Direct measurement of\nthree-dimensional velocities, based on accurate proper motions and\nline-of-sight velocities, has revealed that the majority of halo stars in the\ninner-halo region move on eccentric orbits. However, our understanding of the\nmotions of distant, in-situ halo-star samples is still limited, due to the lack\nof accurate proper motions for these stars. Here we explore a model-independent\nanalysis of the line-of-sight velocities and spatial distribution of a recent\nsample of 1865 carefully selected halo blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars\nwithin 30 kpc of the Galactic center. We find that the mean rotational velocity\nof the very metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2.0) BHB stars significantly lags behind that\nof the relatively more metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -2.0) BHB stars. We also find that\nthe relatively more metal-rich BHB stars are dominated by stars with eccentric\norbits, as previously observed for other stellar samples in the inner-halo\nregion. By contrast, the very metal-poor BHB stars are dominated by stars on\nrounder, lower-eccentricity orbits. Our results indicate that the motion of the\nprogenitor systems of the Milky Way that contributed to the stellar populations\nfound within 30 kpc correlates directly with their metal abundance, which may\nbe related to their physical properties such as gas fractions. These results\nare consistent with the existence of an inner/outer halo structure for the halo\nsystem, as advocated by Carollo et al. (2010).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 10:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Firstly, we present the notion\nof balance in terms which are logically consistent, but also consistent with\nthe way sociologists use the term. The main message is that the notion can only\nbe meaningfully applied to undirected graphs. Secondly, we correct the analysis\nof triads in the karate club graph. This results in the interesting observation\nthat the graph is, in a precise sense, quite \"unbalanced\".

A symmetric Landau potential of\nsixth-order is employed. Dislocation field and elasticity modify the\nsecond-order and fourth-order coefficients of the Landau polynomial,\nrespectively, where the former makes the coefficient singular at the origin.\nThe TDGL equation is solved numerically using a finite volume method, where a\nwide range of parameter sets is explored. Computations are made for\ntemperatures both above and below the transition temperature of a defect-free\ncrystal Tc0. In both cases, the effects of the elastic properties of the solid\nand the strength of interaction between the order parameter and the elastic\ndisplacement field are examined. If the system is quenched below Tc0, steady\nstate is first reached on the compressive side of the dislocation. On the\ntensile side, the growth is held back. The effect of thermal noise term in the\nTDGL equation is studied. We find that if the dislocation is introduced above\nTc0, thermal noise supports the nucleation of the second phase, and steady\nstate will be attained earlier than if the thermal noise were absent. For a\ndislocation-free solid, we have compared our numerical computations for a\nmean-field (spatially averaged) order parameter versus time with the late time\ngrowth of the ensemble-averaged order parameter, calculated analytically, and\nfind that both results follow late time logistic curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 11:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-19"}

Then we make predictions that when N_f is within the\nconformal window, the propagator of a meson G(t) behaves at large t, as G(t) =\nc exp(-m_H t)/t^alpha, that is, a modified Yukawa-type decay form, instead of\nthe usual exponential decay form in the small quark mass region.

If the data covariance and precision\nmatrices are estimated by sampling independent realisations of the data, their\nstatistical properties are described by the Wishart and Inverse-Wishart\ndistributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show\nthat the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a Figure-of-Merit, is\nequal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the\nonly unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional\naccuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the\nnumber of independent realisations and the number of data points, and so can\neasily diverge.

This effect can occur in Kerr-type systems driven by a laser due to\nstrong nonlinear photon-photon interactions. We predict the occurrence of\nhigher-order photon blockades where the transmission of more than two photons\nis effectively blocked by single- and two-photon states. This photon blockade\ncan be achieved by tuning the frequency of the laser driving field to be equal\nto the sum of the Kerr nonlinearity and the cavity resonance frequency. We\nrefer to this phenomenon as two-photon blockade or two-photon state truncation\nvia nonlinear scissors, and can also be interpreted as photon-induced\ntunneling. We also show that, for a driving-field frequency fulfilling another\nresonance condition and for higher strengths of the driving field, even a\nthree-photon blockade can occur but less clearly than in the case of single-\nand two-photon blockades. We demonstrate how various photon blockades can be\nidentified by analyzing photon-number correlations, coherence and entropic\nproperties, Wigner functions, and spectra of squeezing. We show that two- and\nthree-photon blockades can, in principle, be observed in various cavity and\ncircuit quantum electrodynamical systems for which the standard single-photon\nblockade was observed without the need of using higher-order driving\ninteractions or Kerr media exhibiting higher-order nonlinear susceptibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Dec 2012 14:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 21:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-28"}

They are classified in three categories: numerical,\nsimplified and empirical models. Nevertheless, each of these categories of\nmodels are not convenient for every application. Indeed, the numerical model\nrequires high calculation time; conditions of use of the simplified models are\nlimited, and experimental models need not only important financial resources\nbut also a perfect control of experimental devices (e.g. scale model), as well\nas climatic characteristics of the location (e.g. in situ experiment).

The\noriginality of our paper relies on the coupling of several simplified models of\nindoor daylighting calculations.
