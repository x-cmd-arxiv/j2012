Both dissipative tunneling\ntransitions, with momentum transfer due to disorder scattering, and\nnon-dissipative regime of tunneling, which appears due to intersection of\nelectron and hole branches of energy spectrum, are described. Dependencies of\ntunneling current on concentrations in top and bottom graphene layers, which\nare governed by the voltages applied through independent contacts and gates,\nare considered for the back- and double-gated structures. The current-voltage\ncharacteristics of the back-gated structure are in agreement with the recent\nexperiment [Science 335, 947 (2012)]. For the double-gated structures, the\nresonant dissipative tunneling causes a ten times enhancement of response which\nis important for transistor applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2012 01:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 23:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The AWebHUT uses four web usability levels such as N: Neutral, V:\nViolate, R: Respect, and E: Error to evaluate web usability. The main objective\nof the study is to produce data which is used to answer research questions, (1)\nAre there any categories of web sites which have usability problems? Which\nones? and (2) Are there any categories in which the usability is typically\nhigher? Why? The findings were indicated that all Asia categories have\nusability problems. Furthermore, there are four web sites which have highest\nweb usability problem with violation percentage 71. One step further, the Asia\ncategory: Weather has highest usability problems with 42.2819 as the average of\nthe violation percentage. The category Weather uses tables and images,\nconsiderable amount of those were not satisfying web usability guidelines which\nrelates to tables and images. One step further, the Asia wants to get the same\nlevel of usability as North America, Europe, and Australia therefore it is\nessential to have an automated web usability evaluation in Asia web sites to\nidentify web usability problems which are important for improving Asia web\nsites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2012 02:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}

Here it is\nshown that the property of closure of coset groups can be used to generate the\nbasis and general multiplication rules for extensions of real numbers in a\nsystematic way. The coset approach has the advantage that multiplication rules\nfollow directly from group closure instead of being postulated. In this\napproach, constraints on multiplication parameters can be formulated in ways\nthat capture the symmetry features of the coset group. A complete\nclassification of numbers systems is therefore obtained based on possible group\nstructures of a given order. General matrix representations are also obtained\nthrough the coset procedure and by construction, the form of these matrices is\ninvariant under matrix addition and multiplication. Since group symmetries are\ncaptured naturally into each number system, the coset group approach can add\ninsight into the utility of multidimensional number systems in describing\nsymmetries in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2012 02:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

It also gives an\naffirmative answer to a conjecture of Furstenberg, showing that the projections\nof the \"1-dimensional Sierpinski gasket\" in irrational directions are all of\ndimension 1.\n  As another consequence, if a family of self-similar sets or measures is\nparametrized in a real-analytic manner, then, under an extremely mild\nnon-degeneracy condition, the set of \"exceptional\" parameters has Hausdorff\ndimension 0.

Instead, for games with dominant\nstrategies, the mixing time cannot grow arbitrarily with the inverse of the\nnoise.\n  Finally, we refine our analysis for a subclass of potential games called\ngraphical coordination games, a class of games that have been previously\nstudied in Physics and, more recently, in Computer Science in the context of\ndiffusion of new technologies.
