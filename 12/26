In sharp contrast to the\ncorresponding frequentist literature, very little is known about the properties\nof such priors. Focusing on a broad class of shrinkage priors, we provide\nprecise results on prior and posterior concentration.

There is a hashing scheme that maps feature vectors\nto bit arrays depending on the signs of the inner products between feature\nvectors and the normal vectors of hyperplanes placed in the feature space. This\nhashing can be seen as a discretization of the feature space by hyperplanes. If\nlabels for data are given, one can determine the hyperplanes by using learning\nalgorithms. However, many proposed learning methods do not consider the\nhyperplanes' offsets. Not doing so decreases the number of partitioned regions,\nand the correlation between Hamming distances and Euclidean distances becomes\nsmall. In this paper, we propose a lift map that converts learning algorithms\nwithout the offsets to the ones that take into account the offsets. With this\nmethod, the learning methods without the offsets give the discretizations of\nspaces as if it takes into account the offsets. For the proposed method, we\ninput several high-dimensional feature data sets and studied the relationship\nbetween the statistical characteristics of data, the number of hyperplanes, and\nthe effect of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 02:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-27"}

No external\nimmobilization protocol, neither chemical nor mechanical, was needed. For the\nfirst time, the native gliding movements of Gram-negative Nostoc cyanobacteria\nupon the surface, at speeds up to 900microns/h, were studied by AFM. This was\npossible thanks to an improved combination of a gentle sample preparation\nprocess and an AFM procedure based on fast and complete force-distance curves\nmade at every pixel, drastically reducing lateral forces. No limitation in\nspatial resolution or imaging rate was detected. Gram-positive and non-motile\nRhodococcus wratislaviensis bacteria were studied as well. From the approach\ncurves, Young modulus and turgor pressure were measured for both strains at\ndifferent gliding speeds and are ranging from 20 to 105MPa and 40 to 310kPa\ndepending on the bacterium and the gliding speed. For Nostoc, spatially limited\nzones with higher values of stiffness were observed. The related spatial period\nis much higher than the mean length of Nostoc nodules. This was explained by an\ninhomogeneous mechanical activation of nodules in the Nostoc. We also observed\nthe presence of a soft extra cellular matrix (ECM) around the Nostoc bacterium.\nBoth strains left a track of polymeric slime with variable thicknesses. For\nRhodococcus, it is equal to few hundreds of nm, likely to promote its adhesion\nto the sample. While gliding, the Nostoc secretes a slime layer the thickness\nof which is in the nanometer range and increases with the gliding speed.

In contrast to the predictions of accretion models that\nfeature protoplanetary disk planetesimals evolving on dynamically cold orbits\n(with both very small eccentricities, e, and inclinations, i), in reality TNOs\nexhibit surprisingly wide ranges of orbital eccentricities and inclinations.\nSeveral theoretical models have addressed the origin and orbital evolution of\nthe main dynamical classes of TNOs, but none have successfully reproduced them\nall. In addition, none have explained several objects on peculiar orbits, or\nprovided insightful predictions, without which a model cannot be tested\nproperly against observations. Based on extensive simulations of planetesimal\ndisks with the presence of the four giant planets and huge numbers of modeled\nplanetesimals, I explore in detail the dynamics of the TNOs, in particular\ntheir (un)stable regions over timescales comparable to the age of the solar\nsystem, and the role of resonances across the entire trans-Neptunian region. I\nalso propose that, along with the orbital history of the giant planets, the\norbital evolution of primordial embryos (massive planetesimals comparable to\nMars-Earth masses) can explain the fine orbital structure of the\ntrans-Neptunian belt, the orbits of Jovian and Neptunian Trojans, and possibly\nthe current orbits of the giant planets. Those primordial embryos were\nultimately scattered by the giant planets, a process that stirred both the\norbits of the giant planets and the primordial planetesimal disk to the levels\nobserved at 40-50 AU. In particular, the main constraints provided by the\ntrans-Neptunian belt are optimally satisfied if at least one such primordial\nembryo (planetoid) survived in the outskirts of the solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 06:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-17"}

This simplified swimming\nmodel allows one to represent different types of propulsion (pullers and\npushers) and is thus ideal to study the hydrodynamic interactions among\nswimmers. We use the SPM to study the diffusive behavior which arises due to\nthe swimming motion of the particles, and show that there are two basic\nmechanisms responsible for this phenomena: the hydrodynamic interactions caused\nby the squirming motion of the particles, and the particle-particle collisions.\nThis dual nature gives rise to two distinct time- and length- scales, and thus\nto two diffusion coefficients, which we obtain by a suitable analysis of the\nswimming motion. We show that the collisions between swimmers can be\ninterpreted in terms of binary collisions, in which the effective collision\nradius is reduced due to the collision dynamics of swimming particles in\nviscous fluids. At short time-scales, the dynamics of the swimmer is analogous\nto that of an inert tracer particle in a swimming suspension, in which the\ndiffusive motion is caused by fluid-particle collisions.

The question is now to know if cluster properties can evolve more\nsignificantly at redshifts notably higher than 1. We propose here to see how\nthe properties of the intracluster light (ICL) evolve with redshift by\ndetecting and analysing the ICL in the X-ray cluster CL J1449+0856 at z=2.07\n(discovered by Gobat et al. 2011), based on deep HST NICMOS H band exposures.We\nused the same wavelet-based method as that applied to 10 clusters between z=0.4\nand 0.8 by Guennou et al. (2012). We detect three diffuse light sources with\nrespective total magnitudes of H=24.8, 25.5, and 25.9, plus a more compact\nobject with a magnitude H=25.3. We discuss the significance of our detections\nand show that they are robust. The three sources of diffuse light indicate an\nelongation along a north-east south-west axis, similar to that of the\ndistribution of the central galaxies and to the X-ray elongation. This strongly\nsuggests a history of merging events along this direction. While Guennou et al.\n(2012) found a roughly constant amount of diffuse light for clusters between\nz~0 and 0.8, we put in evidence at least a 1.5 magnitude increase between z~0.8\nand 2. If we assume that the amount of diffuse light is directly linked to the\ninfall activity on the cluster, this implies that CL J1449+0856 is still\nundergoing strong merging events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 10:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

No clear signatures of radio-lobe interaction with\nthe diffuse hot gas is evident in this case.

The\nexposure of a path $P$ can be measured as the number of nodes adjacent to it,\ndenoted by $N[P]$. A path is said to be secluded if its exposure is small. A\nsimilar measure can be applied to other connected subgraphs, such as Steiner\ntrees connecting a given set of terminals. Such subgraphs may be relevant due\nto considerations of privacy, security or revenue maximization. This paper\nconsiders problems related to minimum exposure connectivity structures such as\npaths and Steiner trees. It is shown that on unweighted undirected $n$-node\ngraphs, the problem of finding the minimum exposure path connecting a given\npair of vertices is strongly inapproximable, i.e., hard to approximate within a\nfactor of $O(2^{\\log^{1-\\epsilon}n})$ for any $\\epsilon>0$ (under an\nappropriate complexity assumption), but is approximable with ratio\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta}+3$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree in the graph.

The results from our sample sets indicate\nthat range from 35%-90% of the Web has at least one archived copy, 17%-49% has\nbetween 2-5 copies, 1%-8% has 6-10 copies, and 8%-63% has more than 10 copies\nin public web archives. The number of URI copies varies as a function of time,\nbut no more than 31.3% of URIs are archived more than once per month.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 13:36:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2013 04:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-08"}

The main problem is the\ncalibration and correction of the Direction Dependent Effects (DDE) that can\naffect the electro-magnetic field (antenna beams, ionosphere, Faraday rotation,\netc.). As shown earlier the A-Projection is a fast and accurate algorithm that\ncan potentially correct for any given DDE in the imaging step. With its very\nwide field of view, low operating frequency ($\\sim30-250$ MHz), long baselines,\nand complex station-dependent beam patterns, the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is\ncertainly the most complex SKA precursor. In this paper we present a few\nimplementations of A-Projection applied to LOFAR that can deal with non-unitary\nstation beams and non-diagonal Mueller matrices. The algorithm is designed to\ncorrect for all the DDE, including individual antenna, projection of the\ndipoles on the sky, beam forming and ionospheric effects. We describe a few\nimportant algorithmic optimizations related to LOFAR's architecture allowing us\nto build a fast imager. Based on simulated datasets we show that A-Projection\ncan give dramatic dynamic range improvement for both phased array beams and\nionospheric effects. We will use this algorithm for the construction of the\ndeepest extragalactic surveys, comprising hundreds of days of integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 13:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

UCAC4 is an\nupdated version of UCAC3 with about the same number of stars also covering\nall-sky. Bugs were fixed, Schmidt plate survey data were avoided, and precise\n5-band photometry were added. Astrograph observations have been supplemented\nfor bright stars by FK6, Hipparcos and Tycho-2 data to compile a UCAC4 star\ncatalog complete to about magnitude R = 16. Epoch 1998 to 2004 positions are\nobtained from observations with the 20 cm aperture USNO Astrograph's red lens,\nequipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Mean positions and proper motions are derived by\ncombining these observations with over 140 ground- and space-based catalogs,\nincluding Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as unpublished measures of\nover 5000 plates from other astrographs. For most of the faint stars the first\nepoch plates from the Southern Proper Motion (SPM) and the Northern Proper\nMotion (NPM) programs form the basis for proper motions.

In the case of massless bare fermion, masses of both\nparticles are generated leading thereby to parity breaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2012 15:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2013 21:25:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 18:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-22"}

It is shown that when collision frequency of plasma\nparticles tends to zero (plasma passes to collisionless one), the deduced\nformula for dielectric function passes to the known Lindhard' formula for\ncollisionless plasmas. It is shown that the deduced formula for dielectric\npermeability coincides with known Mermin's formula. Graphic research of the\nreal and imaginary parts of dielectric function is made. Graphic comparison of\nthe real and imaginary parts of dielectric function for quantum and classical\nplasma also is made.
