Clustering protocols\nneed to elect optimal number of clusters in hierarchically structured wireless\nsensor networks. Any clustering scheme that elects clusters uniformly\n(irrespective of the distance from Base Station) incurs excessive energy usage\non clusters proximal and distant to Base Station.

As a\nresult, when designing a resource allocation scheme, be it a medium access\nscheduler or a flow rate controller, one needs to consider the interdependence\namong nodes within interference range of each other. Specifically, control\nplane information needs to reach nearby nodes which often lie outside the\ncommuni- cation range, but within the interference range of a node of interest.\nBut how can one communicate control plane information well beyond the existing\ncommunication range? To address this fundamental need we introduce tag\nspotting. Tag spotting refers to a communication system which allows re- liable\ncontrol data transmission at SNR values as low as 0 dB. It does this by\nemploying a number of signal encoding techniques including adding redundancy to\nmultitone modulation, shaping the spectrum to reduce inter-carrier interfer-\nence, and the use of algebraic coding. Making use of a detection theory-based\nmodel we analyze the performance achievable by our modulation as well as the\ntrade-off between the rate of the information transmitted and the likelihood of\nerror. Using real-world experiments on an OFDM system built with software\nradios, we show that we can transmit data at the target SNR value of 0 dB with\na 6% overhead; that is, 6% of our packet is used for our low-SNR decodable tags\n(which carry up to a couple of bytes of data in our testbed), while the remain-\ning 94% is used for traditional header and payload data. We also demonstrate\nvia simulations how tag spotting can be used in implementing fair and efficient\nrate control and scheduling schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 18:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-10"}

Low-rank\napproximations of the kernel matrix are often considered as they allow the\nreduction of running time complexities to O(p^2 n), where p is the rank of the\napproximation. The practicality of such methods thus depends on the required\nrank p.

When\nprepared in a superposition of two states and allowed to evolve freely, the\nstate of the system precesses with a frequency proportional to the splitting\nbetween the states. In QIS,this precession forms the basis for universal\ncontrol of the qubit,and in metrology the frequency of the precession provides\na sensitive measurement of the splitting. However, on a timescale of the\ncoherence time, $T_2$, the qubit loses its quantum information due to\ninteractions with its noisy environment, causing qubit oscillations to decay\nand setting a limit on the fidelity of quantum control and the precision of\nqubit-based measurements. Understanding how the qubit couples to its\nenvironment and the dynamics of the noise in the environment are therefore key\nto effective QIS experiments and metrology. Here we show measurements of the\nlevel splitting and dephasing due to voltage noise of a GaAs singlet-triplet\nqubit during exchange oscillations. Using free evolution and Hahn echo\nexperiments we probe the low frequency and high frequency environmental\nfluctuations, respectively.

Our analysis confirms that the average number of\nsatellites around bright primaries, when expressed in terms of\nsatellite-to-primary stellar mass ratio (m_*^sat/M_*^pri), is a strong function\nof M_*^pri.

A family of one-dimensional interval exchange\ntransformations is constructed as a model system in which to study these types\nof mixing processes. Illustrative examples of the mixing behaviors, including\npathological cases that violate the assumptions of the known governing theorems\nand lead to poor mixing, are shown. Since the mathematical theory applies as\nthe number of iterations of the map goes to infinity, we introduce practical\nmeasures of mixing (the percent unmixed and the number of intermaterial\ninterfaces) that can be computed over given (finite) numbers of iterations. We\nfind that good mixing can be achieved after a finite number of iterations of a\none-dimensional cutting and shuffling map, even though such a map cannot be\nconsidered chaotic in the usual sense and/or it may not fulfill the conditions\nof the ergodic theorems for interval exchange transformations. Specifically,\ngood shuffling can occur with only six or seven intervals of roughly the same\nlength, as long as the rearrangement order is an irreducible permutation.

For five\nevents under consideration, the CME initiation is marked by filament\n(prominence) eruption or by a loop-like structure having another nature.\nSubsequently, several loop-like structures having higher brightness and\nfollowing each other at different velocities appear in the region of the CME\ninitiation. The CME frontal structure is formed by these loop-like structures.\nThe time-dependent velocities and acceleration of the ejection front have been\nobtained for all CMEs under consideration. We have drawn a conclusion about the\npossible existence of two CME types dependent on the time profile of their\nvelocity. The first CME type comprises the ejections whose velocity decreases\nabruptly by more than 100 km/s after having reached the maximum; it thereupon\npasses to slow deceleration/variation. The second CME type is formed by the\nejections whose velocity varies insignificantly after reaching the maximum. The\nCME angular size is shown to increase up to threefold at the initial stage of\npropagation; it increases twofold 3.5-11 minutes after the first measurement of\nthis parameter. When considering 3 CMEs, we see that their broadening exceeds\ntheir extension in the longitudinal direction during a certain period of time\nat the initial propagation stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 01:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-13"}

In designing structures and optimizing\ndevice performances, it is crucial that the Mg content of the alloy be\ncontrollable and precisely determined. In this study, we have established\nlaboratory-based methods to determine the Mg content of MgxZn1-xO thin films\ngrown on ZnO substrates, ranging from the solubility limit of x ~ 0.4 to the\ndilute limit of x < 0.01. For the absolute determination of Mg content,\nRutherford backscattering spectroscopy is used for the high Mg region above x =\n0.14, while secondary ion mass spectroscopy is employed to quantify low Mg\ncontent. As a lab-based method to determine the Mg content, c-axis length is\nmeasured by X-ray diffraction and is well associated with Mg content. The\ninterpolation enables the determination of Mg content to x = 0.023, where the\npeak from the ZnO substrate overlaps the MgxZn1-xO peak in standard laboratory\nequipment, and thus quantitative determination. At dilute Mg contents below x =\n0.023, the localized exciton peak energy of the MgxZn1-xO films as measured by\nphotoluminescence is found to show a linear Mg content dependence, which is\nwell resolved from the free exciton peak of ZnO substrate down to x = 0.0043.\nOur results demonstrate that X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence in\ncombination are appropriate methods to determine Mg content in a wide Mg range\nfrom x = 0.004 to 0.40 in a laboratory environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 01:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-14"}

This is the reason for the composition claim. However, the\nquantity of the trace distance (or variational distance) is not the probability\nfor such an event. If $d $ is not small enough, always the generated key\nsequence is not uniform. Now one needs the reconstruction of the evaluation of\nthe trace distance if one wants to use it. One should first go back to the\nindistinguishability theory in the computational complexity based, and to\nclarify the meaning of the value of the variational distance. In addition, the\nsame analysis for the information theoretic case is necessary. The recent\nserial papers by H.P.Yuen have given the answer on such questions. In this\npaper, we show more concise description of Yuen's theory, and clarify that the\nrecent upper bound theories for the trace distance by Tomamichel et al and\nHayashi et al are constructed based on the reasoning of Renner and it is\nunsuitable as the analysis for information theoretic security. Finally, we\nintroduce a macroscopic quantum communication with different principle to\nreplace Q-bit QKD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 07:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 23:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

They often exhibit a\nhuge number of different behaviors, as soon as the active entities (peers,\nagents, processes, etc) behave in an asynchronous manner. Already the\nmodelization of such systems is a non-trivial task, let alone their formal\nverification.\n  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problem of distributed monitoring\non a simple model of finite-state distributed automata based on shared actions,\ncalled asynchronous automata. Monitoring is a question related to runtime\nverification: assume that we have to check a property $L$ against an unknown or\nvery complex system $A$, so that classical static analysis is not possible.\nTherefore instead of model-checking a monitor is used, that checks the property\non the underlying system at runtime.\n  We are interested here in monitoring distributed systems modeled as\nasynchronous automata. It is natural to require that monitors should be of the\nsame kind as the underlying system, so we consider here distributed monitoring.\nA distributed monitor does not have a global view of the system, therefore we\npropose the notion of locally monitorable trace language. Our main result shows\nthat if the distributed alphabet of actions is connected and if $L$ is a set of\ninfinite traces such that both $L$ and its complement $L^c$ are countable\nunions of locally safety languages, then $L$ is locally monitorable. We also\nshow that over infinite traces, recognizable countable unions of locally safety\nlanguages are precisely the complements of deterministic languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 09:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-13"}

For thermal excitations, however, the\nlatter is of great interest, because it forms the \"activated complex\" that\nmediates the collapse of the condensate. For a certain value of the s-wave\nscatting length our investigations reveal a bifurcation in the transition\nstate, leading to the emergence of two additional and symmetry-breaking excited\nstates. Because these are of lower energy than their symmetric counterpart, we\npredict the occurrence of a symmetry-breaking thermally induced collapse of\ndipolar condensates. We show that its occurrence crucially depends on the trap\ngeometry and calculate the thermal decay rates of the system within leading\norder transition state theory with the help of a uniform rate formula near the\nrank-2 saddle which allows to smoothly pass the bifurcation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 11:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}

For sufficiently\nmany fundamental flavors, chiral symmetry is restored via a bulk, first-order\ntransition. This chirally symmetric phase appears to be analytically connected\nwith the expected conformal window of many-flavor continuum QCD. We perform\nsimulations in the chirally symmetric phase at zero quark mass for various\nsystem sizes L, and measure the torelon mass, the Dirac spectrum and the hadron\nspectrum. All masses go to zero with 1/L. L is hence the only infrared length\nscale. Thus, the strong-coupling chirally restored phase appears as a\nconvenient laboratory to study IR-conformality.

We first prove that these representations are\nintegrable as well, with respect to a wide variety of weights, thus allowing to\nconsistently quantify coefficient decay via coorbit space norms. We then show\nthat these spaces always admit an atomic decomposition in terms of bandlimited\nSchwartz wavelets.

Unfortunately, that kind of data is very hard to obtain. One of the\nfew exceptions is the \"Romantic network\" which is a complete structure of a\nreal sexual network of a high school. In terms of topology, unlike other sexual\nnetworks classified as scale-free network. Regarding the temporal structure,\nseveral studies indicate that relationship timing can have effects on diffusion\nthrough networks, as relationship order determines transmission routes.With the\naim to check if the particular structure, static and dynamic, of the Romantic\nnetwork is determinant for the propagation of an STI in it, we perform\nsimulations in two scenarios: the static network where all contacts are\navailable and the dynamic case where contacts evolve in time. In the static\ncase, we compare the epidemic results in the Romantic network with some\nparadigmatic topologies. We further study the behavior of the epidemic on the\nRomantic network in response to the effect of any individual, belonging to the\nnetwork, having a contact with an external infected subject, the influence of\nthe degree of the initial infected, and the effect of the variability of\ncontacts per unit time. We also consider the dynamics of formation of pairs in\nand we study the propagation of the diseases in this dynamic scenario. Our\nresults suggest that while the Romantic network can not be labeled as a\nWatts-Strogatz network, it is, regarding the propagation of an STI, very close\nto one with high disorder. Our simulations confirm that relationship timing\naffects, but strongly lowering, the final outbreak size. Besides, shows a clear\ncorrelation between the average degree and the outbreak size over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 16:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
