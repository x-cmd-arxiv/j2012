One of the most commonly used models is represented\nby the bidomain equations, the derivation of which relies on a homogenisation\ntechnique to construct a suitable approximation to the discrete model. This\nderivation does not explicitly account for the presence of gap junctions\nconnecting one cell to another. It has been seen experimentally [Rohr,\nCardiovasc. Res. 2004] that these gap junctions have a marked effect on the\npropagation of the action potential, specifically as the upstroke of the wave\npasses through the gap junction.\n  In this paper we explicitly include gap junctions in a both a 2D discrete\nmodel of cardiac electrophysiology, and the corresponding continuum model, on a\nsimplified cell geometry. Using these models we compare the results of\nsimulations using both continuum and discrete systems. We see that the form of\nthe action potential as it passes through gap junctions cannot be replicated\nusing a continuum model, and that the underlying propagation speed of the\naction potential ceases to match up between models when gap junctions are\nintroduced. In addition, the results of the discrete simulations match the\ncharacteristics of those shown in Rohr 2004. From this, we suggest that a\nhybrid model -- a discrete system following the upstroke of the action\npotential, and a continuum system elsewhere -- may give a more accurate\ndescription of cardiac electrophysiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2012 16:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-22"}

So, tumor cells ecologically\ninterplay with other kind of cells, e.g. endothelial cells or immune system\neffectors, producing and exchanging various chemical signals. As such, tumor\ngrowth is an ideal object of hybrid modeling where discrete stochastic\nprocesses model agents at low concentrations, and mean-field equations model\nchemical signals. In previous works we proposed a hybrid version of the\nwell-known Panetta-Kirschner mean-field model of tumor cells, effector cells\nand Interleukin-2. Our hybrid model suggested -at variance of the inferences\nfrom its original formulation- that immune surveillance, i.e. tumor elimination\nby the immune system, may occur through a sort of side-effect of large\nstochastic oscillations. However, that model did not account that, due to both\nchemical transportation and cellular differentiation/division, the\ntumor-induced recruitment of immune effectors is not instantaneous but,\ninstead, it exhibits a lag period. To capture this, we here integrate a\nmean-field equation for Interleukins-2 with a bi-dimensional delayed stochastic\nprocess describing such delayed interplay. An algorithm to realize trajectories\nof the underlying stochastic process is obtained by coupling the Piecewise\nDeterministic Markov process (for the hybrid part) with a Generalized\nSemi-Markovian clock structure (to account for delays). We (i) relate tumor\nmass growth with delays via simulations and via parametric sensitivity analysis\ntechniques, (ii) we quantitatively determine probabilistic eradication times,\nand (iii) we prove, in the oscillatory regime, the existence of a heuristic\nstochastic bifurcation resulting in delay-induced tumor eradication, which is\nneither predicted by the mean-field nor by the hybrid non-delayed models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2012 16:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

The classification of\ncancer progression using discrete states like stages and hallmarks has become\ncommon in the biology literature, but primarily as an organizing principle, and\nnot as an executable formalism. The precise computational model developed here\naims to exploit this untapped potential, namely, through automatic verification\nof progression models (e.g., consistency, causal connections, etc.),\nclassification of unreachable or unstable states and computer-generated\n(individualized or universal) therapy plans. The paper builds on a\nphenomenological approach, and as such does not need to assume a model for the\nbiochemistry of the underlying natural progression. Rather, it abstractly\nmodels transition timings between states as well as the effects of drugs and\nclinical tests, and thus allows formalization of temporal statements about the\nprogression as well as notions of timed therapies. The model proposed here is\nultimately based on hybrid automata, and we show how existing controller\nsynthesis algorithms can be generalized to CHA models, so that therapies can be\ngenerated automatically. Throughout this paper we use cancer hallmarks to\nrepresent the discrete states through which cancer progresses, but other\nnotions of discretely or continuously varying state formalisms could also be\nused to derive similar therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2012 16:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but\ngravitationally active part of the universe. Its nature is unknown but the\nconfirmation of a scalar Higgs is giving a boost to scalar-field-theories. So\nfar gravity experiments and observations performed at different distances find\nno deviation from Newton's gravity law. Therefore dark energy must possess a\nscreening mechanism which suppresses the scalar-mediated fifth force. Our line\nof attack is a novel gravity experiment with neutrons based on a quantum\ninterference technique. The spectroscopic measurement of quantum states on\nresonances with an external coupling makes this a powerful search for dark\nmatter and dark energy contributions in the universe. Quantum states in the\ngravity potential are intimately related to other scalar field or spin-0-bosons\nif they exist. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interact with a\nneutron, this results in a measurable energy shift of quantum states in the\ngravity potential, because for neutrons the screening effect is absent. We use\nGravity Resonance Spectroscopy to measure the energy splitting at the highest\nlevel of precision, providing a constraint on any possible new interaction.

While portions of the maize and mexicana genomes were\nparticularly resistant to introgression (notably near known\ncross-incompatibility and domestication loci), we detected widespread evidence\nfor introgression in both directions of gene flow.

In the context of ordered qubit registers this scheme\nfinds a natural translation in terms of global operations, and single particle\nmeasurements on the edge of the array. Two applications of this scheme are\npresented. First, through appropriate Wick rotations, those amplitudes can be\nanalytically continued to yield estimates for partition functions of Ising\nmodels. Bounds on the estimation error, valid with high confidence, are\nprovided through a central-limit theorem, which validity extends beyond the\npresent context. It holds for example for estimations of the Jones polynomial.\nInterestingly, the kind of state preparations and measurements involved in this\napplication can in principle be made \"instantaneous\", i.e. independent of the\nsystem size or the parameters being simulated. Second, the scheme allows to\naccurately estimate some non-trivial invariants of links. A third result\nconcerns the computational power of estimations of partition functions for real\ntemperature classical ferromagnetic Ising models on a square lattice. We\nprovide conditions under which estimating such partition functions allows one\nto reconstruct scattering amplitudes of quantum circuits making the problem\nBQP-hard.

Thus the supersymmetry of\na given background can be stated in terms of gauge invariant and well defined\nphysical observables of the Chern-Simons theory. We then show that for N\\geq 4,\nthe sl(N|N-1) theory admits smooth supersymmetric conical defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 06:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 05:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 09:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Previous analysis of the\nADMM typically assumes that the objective function is the sum of only two\nconvex functions defined on two separable blocks of variables even though the\nalgorithm works well in numerical experiments for three or more blocks.\nMoreover, there has been no rate of convergence analysis for the ADMM without\nstrong convexity in the objective function. In this paper we establish the\nglobal linear convergence of the ADMM for minimizing the sum of any number of\nconvex separable functions. This result settles a key question regarding the\nconvergence of the ADMM when the number of blocks is more than two or if the\nstrong convexity is absent. It also implies the linear convergence of the ADMM\nfor several contemporary applications including LASSO, Group LASSO and Sparse\nGroup LASSO without any strong convexity assumption. Our proof is based on\nestimating the distance from a dual feasible solution to the optimal dual\nsolution set by the norm of a certain proximal residual, and by requiring the\ndual stepsize to be sufficiently small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 06:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Oct 2012 01:45:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 01:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

Forthcoming satellite and sub-orbital experiments\nprobing polarization in the CMB are expected to measure the B-mode power in CMB\npolarization, coming from PGWs on the degree scale, as well as gravitational\nlensing on arcmin scales; the latter is the main competitor for the measurement\nof PGWs, and is directly affected by the underlying expansion history,\ndetermined by the presence of a DE component. In particular, we consider early\nDE possible scenarios, in which the expansion history is substantially modified\nat the epoch in which the CMB lensing is most relevant. We show that the\nintroduction of a parametrized DE may induce a variation as large as 30% in the\nratio of the power of lensing and PGWs on the degree scale. We find that\nadopting the nominal specifications of upcoming satellite measurements the\nconstraining power on PGWs is weakened by the inclusion of the extra degrees of\nfreedom, resulting in a reduction of about 10% of the upper limits on r in\nfiducial models with no GWs, as well as a comparable increase in the error bars\nin models with non-zero r.

Thermal inertia\ngoverns the Yarkovsky effect, a non-gravitational force which significantly\nalters the orbits of asteroids up to \\sim 20 km in diameter. Yet, very little\nhas previously been known about the thermal inertia of small asteroids\nincluding NEAs. Observational and theoretical work is reported. The thermal\nemission of asteroids has been observed in the mid-infrared (5-35 {\\mu}m)\nwavelength range using the Spitzer Space Telescope and the 3.0m IRTF. A\ndetailed thermophysical model (TPM) has been developed and extensively tested;\nthis is the first detailed TPM shown to be applicable to NEA data. Our main\nresult is the determination of the thermal inertia of 5 NEAs, increasing the\ntotal number of NEAs with measured thermal inertia to 6. For two of our\ntargets, previously available estimates are refined. Our results allow the\nfirst determination of the typical thermal inertia of NEAs, which is around 300\nJ s^{-1/2} K^{-1} m^{-2}, larger than the typical thermal inertia of large\nmain-belt asteroids (MBAs) by more than an order of magnitude. In particular,\nthermal inertia appears to increase with decreasing asteroid diameter. Our\nresults have been used by colleagues to estimate the size dependence of the\nYarkovsky effect, thus explaining the apparent difference in the size-frequency\ndistribution of NEAs and similarly sized MBAs. Thermal inertia is a very\nsensitive indicator for the presence or absence of particulate material on the\nsurface.

Getting agents in the\nInternet, and in networks in general, to invest in and deploy security features\nand protocols is a challenge, in particular because of economic reasons arising\nfrom the presence of network externalities.\n  In this paper, we focus on the question of incentive alignment for agents of\na large network towards a better security. We start with an economic model for\na single agent, that determines the optimal amount to invest in protection. The\nmodel takes into account the vulnerability of the agent to a security breach\nand the potential loss if a security breach occurs. We derive conditions on the\nquality of the protection to ensure that the optimal amount spent on security\nis an increasing function of the agent's vulnerability and potential loss. We\nalso show that for a large class of risks, only a small fraction of the\nexpected loss should be invested.\n  Building on these results, we study a network of interconnected agents\nsubject to epidemic risks. We derive conditions to ensure that the incentives\nof all agents are aligned towards a better security. When agents are strategic,\nwe show that security investments are always socially inefficient due to the\nnetwork externalities. Moreover alignment of incentives typically implies a\ncoordination problem, leading to an equilibrium with a very high price of\nanarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 12:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We have studied positive streamer discharges in a 16 cm\npoint-plane gap in high-purity nitrogen 6.0, created by 25 kV pulses with a\nduration of 130 ns. The voltage rise varies by a rise rate from 1.9 kV/ns to\n2.7 kV/ns and by the first peak voltage of 22 to 28 kV. A structural link is\nfound between smaller discharges with a larger inception cloud caused by a\nfaster rising voltage. This relation is explained by the greater stability of\nthe inception cloud due to a faster voltage rise, causing a delay in the\ndestabilisation. Time-resolved measurements show that the inception cloud\npropagates slower than an earlier destabilised, more filamentary discharge.\nThis explains that the discharge with a faster rising voltage pulse ends up to\nbe shorter.

We carried out a radial-velocity survey to search for planets around\nmetal-poor stars. In this paper we report the discovery of two planets around\nHIP 11952, a metal-poor star with [Fe/H]= -1.9 that belongs to our target\nsample. Methods. Radial velocity variations of HIP 11952 were monitored\nsystematically with FEROS at the 2.2 m telescope located at the ESO La Silla\nobservatory from August 2009 until January 2011. We used a cross-correlation\ntechnique to measure the stellar radial velocities (RV). Results. We detected a\nlong-period RV variation of 290 d and a short-period one of 6.95 d. The\nspectroscopic analysis of the stellar activity reveals a stellar rotation\nperiod of 4.8 d. The Hipparcos photometry data shows intra-day variabilities,\nwhich give evidence for stellar pulsations. Based on our analysis, the observed\nRV variations are most likely caused by the presence of unseen planetary\ncompanions. Assuming a primary mass of 0.83 M\\odot, we computed minimum\nplanetary masses of 0.78 MJup for the inner and 2.93 MJup for the outer planet.\nThe semi-major axes are a1 = 0.07 AU and a2 = 0.81 AU, respectively.\nConclusions. HIP 11952 is one of very few stars with [Fe/H]< -1.0 which have\nplanetary companions. This discovery is important to understand planet\nformation around metal-poor stars\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 13:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

Waves are excited inside the flux\ntube and propagate along the field lines, and jacket modes are generated in the\nsurroundings of the flux tube, carrying 40% as much energy as the tube modes.\nThe resulting scattered wave is mainly an f-mode composed of a mixture of m=0\nand m=+/-1 modes.

While\nexistence of such functions implies termination, these problems are not\nequivalent to termination. When the variables range over the rationals (or\nreals), it is known that both problems are PTIME decidable. However, when they\nrange over the integers, whether for single-path or multipath loops, the\ncomplexity has not yet been determined. We show that both problems are\ncoNP-complete. However, we point out some special cases of importance of PTIME\ncomplexity. We also present complete algorithms for synthesizing linear and\nlexicographical-linear ranking functions, both for the general case and the\nspecial PTIME cases. Moreover, in the rational setting, our algorithm for\nsynthesizing lexicographical-linear ranking functions extends existing ones,\nbecause our class of ranking functions is more general, yet it has polynomial\ntime complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 15:25:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2013 11:51:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2013 09:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-10"}

As a means of maintaining seamless end-user\nexperience in dynamic environments, as well as for ensuring network security,\nthis paper deals with a crucial network monitoring task termed dynamic\nanomalography. Given link traffic measurements (noisy superpositions of\nunobserved OD flows) periodically acquired by backbone routers, the goal is to\nconstruct an estimated map of anomalies in real time, and thus summarize the\nnetwork `health state' along both the flow and time dimensions. Leveraging the\nlow intrinsic-dimensionality of OD flows and the sparse nature of anomalies, a\nnovel online estimator is proposed based on an exponentially-weighted\nleast-squares criterion regularized with the sparsity-promoting $\\ell_1$-norm\nof the anomalies, and the nuclear norm of the nominal traffic matrix. After\nrecasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to online\noptimization, a real-time algorithm for dynamic anomalography is developed and\nits convergence established under simplifying technical assumptions. For\noperational conditions where computational complexity reductions are at a\npremium, a lightweight stochastic gradient algorithm based on Nesterov's\nacceleration technique is developed as well. Comprehensive numerical tests with\nboth synthetic and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of the\nproposed online algorithms and their tracking capabilities, and demonstrate\nthat they outperform state-of-the-art approaches developed to diagnose traffic\nanomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 15:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-10-01"}
