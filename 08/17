Muon\nenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.\nBecause high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in\ndE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in\nlog10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube\ndetector. In this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncated\nmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. The muon track is\ndivided into separate segments with individual dE/dx values. The elimination of\nsegments with the highest dE/dx results in an overall dE/dx that is more\nclosely correlated to the muon energy. This method results in an energy\nresolution of 0.22 in log10(E_mu), which gives a 26% improvement.

However, little is known regarding the details\nof this process, its time scale, and whether molecules with and without thiol\nhydrogen atoms can coexist in molecular junctions. Here we explore\ntheoretically how inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) can shed light on\nthese issues. We present calculations of the geometries, low bias conductances\nand IETS of propanedithiol and propanedithiolate molecular junctions with gold\nelectrodes. We show that IETS can distinguish between junctions with molecules\nhaving no, one or two thiol hydrogen atoms.

We\npredict the frequency of a vibrational mode of the thiol H atom to increase by\na factor \\sim 2 as the gap between the tip and molecule narrows.

We\ninterpret this as the progenitor of SN 2007bg having at least two distinct\nmass-loss episodes (i.e., phases 1 and 3) during its final stages of evolution,\nyielding a highly-stratified circumstellar medium. Modelling the phase 1 light\ncurve as a freely-expanding, synchrotron-emitting shell, self-absorbed by its\nown radiating electrons, requires a progenitor mass-loss rate of\n\\dot{M}~1.9x10^{-6}(v_{w}/1000 km s^{-1}) Solar masses per year for the last\nt~20(v_{w}/1000 km s^{-1}) yr before explosion, and a total energy of the radio\nemitting ejecta of E\\sim1x10^{48} erg after 10 days from explosion. This places\nSN 2007bg among the most energetic Type Ib/c events. We interpret the second\nphase as a sparser \"gap\" region between the two winds stages. Phase 3 shows a\nsecond absorption turn-on before rising to a peak luminosity 2.6 times higher\nthan in phase 1. Assuming this luminosity jump is due to a circumstellar medium\ndensity enhancement from a faster previous mass-loss episode, we estimate that\nthe phase 3 mass-loss rate could be as high as \\dot{M}<~4.3x10^{-4}(v_{w}/1000\nkm s^{-1}) Solar masses per year. The phase 3 wind would have transitioned\ndirectly into the phase 1 wind for a wind speed difference of ~2. In summary,\nthe radio light curve provides robust evidence for dramatic global changes in\nat least some Ic-BL progenitors just prior (~10-1000 yr) to explosion.

Another possibility of their origin is\nthat they stem from disrupted satellite galaxies, but in this case, these gas\nclouds move unaccompanied by a bound DM structure. Since HVCs are observed with\nlong gas tails and with irregular substructures, numerical models are performed\naiming at exploring their structure and compare them with observations. If HVCs\nare engulfed by DM subhalos, their gas must leave the DM gravitational\npotential and reflect this in their dynamics. On the other hand, the evolution\nand survival of pure gas models must be tested to distinguish between\nDM-dominated and DM-free clouds and to allow conclusions on their origin. The\nmodels demonstrate that purely baryonic HVCs with low masses are disrupted by\nram-pressure stripping and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, while more massive\nones survive, losing their initially spherical shape and develop significant\nsubstructures including cometary elongations in the column density distribution\n(\"head-tail structure\").

We find that the efficiency of defect\ncharge screening is strongly dependent on the concentration and location of\ndefects within the DLG. In particular, only a moderate suppression of\nelectron-hole puddles around the Dirac point induced by the high concentration\nof remote impurities in the silicon oxide substrate could be achieved.

We derive analytical results for Eulerian turbulence modeled by\nGaussian random fields for the case with zero mean velocity. Our starting point\nis an exact integrodifferential equation for the particle pair separation\ndistribution. When memory times of particle locations are short, a Markovian\napproximation leads to a Richardson-type diffusion model. We obtain a\ndiffusivity tensor of the form $K_{ij}(r,t)=S_{ij}(r)\\tau(r,t)$ where\n$S_{ij}(r)$ is the structure-function tensor and $\\tau(r,t)$ is an effective\ncorrelation time of velocity increments. This is found to be the minimum value\nof three times: the intrinsic turnover time $\\tau_{eddy}(r)$ at separation $r$,\nthe overall evolution time $t,$ and the sweeping time $r/v_0$ with $v_0$ the\nrms velocity. We study the diffusion model numerically by a Monte Carlo method.\nWith moderate inertial-ranges like those achieved in current KS, our model is\nfound to reproduce the $t^{9/2}$ power-law for pair dispersion predicted by TD\nand observed in the KS. However, for much longer ranges, our model exhibits\nthree distinct pair-dispersion laws in the inertial-range: a Batchelor\n$t^2$-regime, followed by a $t^1$ diffusive regime, and then a $t^6$ regime.\nFinally, outside the inertial-range, there is another $t^1$ regime with\nparticles undergoing independent Taylor diffusion. These scalings are exactly\nthe same as those predicted by TD for KS with large mean velocities, which we\nargue hold also for KS with zero mean velocity. Our results support the basic\nconclusion that sweeping effects make Lagrangian properties of KS fundamentally\ndifferent from hydrodynamic turbulence for very extended inertial-ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 21:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-20"}

For these purposes we derive a realistic low-energy model, using results\nof first-principles calculations and experimental parameters of the crystal\nstructure. Then, we solve this model in the Hartree-Fock approximation. We\nargue that the multiferroic state in YMnO3 has a magnetic origin, and the\ncentrosymmetric Pbnm structure is formally sufficient for explaining details of\nthe noncentrosymmetric magnetic ground state. The relativistic spin-orbit\ninteraction lifts the degeneracy, caused by the frustration of isotropic\ninteractions, and stabilizes a twofold periodic magnetic state, which is\nsimilar to the E-state apart from the spin canting. The noncentrosymmetric\natomic displacements in the P2_1nm phase reduce the spin canting, but do not\nchange the symmetry of the magnetic state. The effect of the P2_1nm distortion\non the FE polarization P_a is twofold: (i) it gives rise to ionic\ncontributions, associated with the Y and O sites; (ii) it affects the\nelectronic polarization, through the change of the spin canting. The relatively\nsmall value of P_a, observed in the experiment, is caused by a partial\ncancelation of the electronic and ionic contributions in the experimental\nP2_1nm structure. Finally, we theoretically optimize the crystal structure, by\nusing the LSDA+U approach and assuming the collinear E-type alignment. We have\nfound that the agreement with the experimental data in this case is less\nsatisfactory and P_a is largely overestimated. Although the magnetic structure\ncan be formally tuned by varying the Coulomb repulsion U as a parameter,\napparently LSDA+U fails to reproduce some fine details of the experimental\nstructure, and the cancelation of different contributions in P_a does not\noccur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 02:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-12"}

Of particular importance is the\nstellar mass density at early times which represents the integral of earlier\nstar formation. An important puzzle arising from the measurements so far\nreported is that the specific star formation rates (sSFR) evolve far less\nrapidly than expected in most theoretical models. Yet the observations\nunderpinning these results remain very uncertain, owing in part to the possible\ncontamination of rest-optical broadband light from strong nebular emission\nlines. To quantify the contribution of nebular emission to broad-band fluxes,\nwe investigate the SEDs of 92 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the\nredshift range 3.8<z<5.0 chosen because the H-alpha line lies within the\nSpitzer/IRAC 3.6 um filter. We demonstrate that the 3.6 um flux is\nsystematically in excess of that expected from stellar continuum, which we\nderive by fitting the SED with population synthesis models. No such excess is\nseen in a control sample at 3.1<z<3.6 in which there is no nebular\ncontamination in the IRAC filters. From the distribution of our 3.6 um flux\nexcesses, we derive an H-alpha equivalent width (EW) distribution. The mean\nrest-frame H-alpha EW we infer at 3.8<z<5.0 (270 A) indicates that nebular\nemission contributes at least 30% of the 3.6 um flux. Via our\nempirically-derived EW distribution we correct the available stellar mass\ndensities and show that the sSFR evolves more rapidly at z>4 than previously\nthought, supporting up to a 5x increase between z~2 and 7. Such a trend is much\ncloser to theoretical expectations. Given our findings, we discuss the\nprospects for verifying quantitatively the nebular emission line strengths\nprior to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 03:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Recently, a strong\ncorrelation was found between the strength of the bar and the presence of\nchaotic motion in this system, as models with relatively strong bars were shown\nto exhibit stronger chaotic behavior compared to those having a weaker bar\ncomponent. Here, we attempt to further explore this connection by studying the\ninterplay between chaotic and regular behavior of star orbits when the\nparameters of the model evolve in time. This happens for example when one\nintroduces linear time dependence in the mass parameters of the model to mimic,\nin some general sense, the effect of self-consistent interactions of the actual\nN-body problem. We thus observe, in this simple time-dependent model also, that\nthe increase of the bar's mass leads to an increase of the system's chaoticity.\nWe propose a new way of using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method as\na reliable criterion to estimate the relative fraction of chaotic vs. regular\norbits in such time-dependent potentials, which proves to be much more\nefficient than the computation of Lyapunov exponents. In particular, GALI is\nable to capture subtle changes in the nature of an orbit (or ensemble of\norbits) even for relatively small time intervals, which makes it ideal for\ndetecting dynamical transitions in time-dependent systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 07:55:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2012 11:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2012 13:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

There is an inherent need to secure the wireless data\ncommunication to ensure the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non\nrepudiation of the data being exchanged.

Planck is able, for the first time, to detect\nSZ emission up to r ~ 3 X R_500. We test previously proposed models for the\npressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. We\nfind that the Arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit Coma, and\nthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the data\nonly at r<R_500: by r=2XR_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by a\nfactor of ~2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either i) the\ncluster SZ emission is contaminated by unresolved SZ sources along the line of\nsight or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at r>R_500 than the mean\npressure profile predicted by the simulations. The Planck image shows\nsignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half a\ndegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features\nare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the\nwestern feature was previously noticed in the ROSAT PSPC mosaic as well as in\nthe radio. Using Planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find\npressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,\nrespectively. Assuming Rankine-Hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deduce\nthat the shock waves should propagate with Mach number M_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 and\nM_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the West and Southeast, respectively. Finally, we find\nthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on Mpc\nscales with small intrinsic scatter. This implies either that the energy\ndensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,\nor that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius than\npreviously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 15:03:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 20:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 12:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

While initial efforts using\nmathematical or statistical modeling of read counts or per-base exonic signal\nhave been successful, they may suffer from model overfitting since not all the\nreference transcripts in a database are expressed under a specific biological\ncondition. Standard shrinkage approaches, such as Lasso, shrink all the\ntranscript abundances to zero in a non-discriminative manner. Thus it does not\nnecessarily yield the set of condition-specific transcripts.

Typical models consist of partial\ndifferential equations that exhibit certain general properties, e.g.,\nhyperbolicity.

Furthermore, linear\nhyperbolic equations with higher-order derivatives provide the mathematical\nunderpinning of the phenomenon of dispersion, i.e., the dependence of a wave's\nphase speed on its wavenumber. For systems of nonlinear first-order hyperbolic\nequations, there also exists a general theory for finding wave solutions. In\naddition, nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations are sometimes said\nto posses wave solutions, though they lack hyperbolicity, because it may be\npossible to find solutions that translate in space with time. Unfortunately, an\nall-encompassing methodology for solution of partial differential equations\nwith any possible combination of nonlinearities does not exist.

A value of\nzero means that the documents are completely dissimilar whereas a value of one\nindicates that the documents are practically identical. Traditionally,\nvector-based models have been used for computing the document similarity. The\nvector-based models represent several features present in documents.

The core device is a small\nrotating blade that imposes cycles of increasing and decreasing forcings to a\ngranular gas, shaken independently. The velocity of this blade is measured,\nsubject to the transitions imposed by the periodic torque variation. The\nHatano-Sasa equality, that generalises the second principle of thermodynamics\nto NESS, is verified with a high accuracy (a few $10^{-3}$), at different\nvariation rates. Besides, it is observed that the fluctuating velocity at fixed\nforcing follows a generalised Gumbel distribution.

A deep understanding of predatory chat\nconversations on the Internet has implications in designing effective solutions\nto automatically identify malicious conversations from regular conversations.\nWe believe that a deeper understanding of the pedophile conversation can result\nin more sophisticated and robust surveillance systems than majority of the\ncurrent systems relying only on shallow processing such as simple word-counting\nor key-word spotting.\n  In this paper, we study pedophile conversations from the perspective of\nonline grooming theory and perform a series of linguistic-based empirical\nanalysis on several pedophile chat conversations to gain useful insights and\npatterns. We manually annotated 75 pedophile chat conversations with six stages\nof online grooming and test several hypothesis on it. The results of our\nexperiments reveal that relationship forming is the most dominant online\ngrooming stage in contrast to the sexual stage. We use a widely used\nword-counting program (LIWC) to create psycho-linguistic profiles for each of\nthe six online grooming stages to discover interesting textual patterns useful\nto improve our understanding of the online pedophile phenomenon. Furthermore,\nwe present empirical results that throw light on various aspects of a pedophile\nconversation such as probability of state transitions from one stage to\nanother, distribution of a pedophile chat conversation across various online\ngrooming stages and correlations between pre-defined word categories and online\ngrooming stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 05:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}
