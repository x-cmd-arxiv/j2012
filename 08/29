This is studied within a network utility maximization\n(NUM) framework in a deterministic setting with a single provider, multiple\nusers and a finite horizon. The provider produces power or buys power in a\n(deterministic) spot market, and determines a dynamic price to charge the\nusers. The users then adjust their demand in response to the time-varying\nprices. This is typically categorized as the demand response problem, and we\nstudy a progression of related models by focusing on two aspects: 1) the\ncharacterization of the structure of the optimal dynamic prices in the Smart\nGrid and the optimal demand and supply under various interaction with a spot\nmarket; 2) a greedy approach to facilitate the solution process of the\naggregate NUM problem and the optimality gap between the greedy solution and\nthe optimal one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 16:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Their computation normally requires the numerical evaluation\nof two-dimensional integrals: one over the coordinate space and the other over\nthe momentum space.

However, quantum mechanics\nimposes a fundamental limit on how well different coher- ent states can be\ndistinguished, even with perfect detectors, and limits such discrimination to\nhave a finite minimum probability of error. While conventional optical\nreceivers lead to error rates well above this fundamental limit, Dolinar found\nan explicit receiver design involving optical feedback and photon counting that\ncan achieve the minimum probability of error for discriminating any two given\ncoherent states. The generalization of this construction to larger sets of\ncoherent states has proven to be challenging, evidencing that there may be a\nlimitation inherent to a linear-optics-based adaptive measurement strategy. In\nthis Letter, we show how to achieve optimal discrimination of any set of\ncoherent states using a resource-efficient quantum computer.

The total wavelength coverage is 0.8um-1.8um and two\nresolution modes: medium resolution and high resolution. In the medium\nresolution mode (R=4,000-6,000) the entire wavelength range 0.8um-1.8um is\nobserved simultaneously, while the high resolution mode covers simultaneously\nthree selected spectral regions: one around the CaII triplet (at R=8,000) to\nmeasure radial velocities, and two regions at R=20,000 one in the J-band and\none in the H-band, for detailed measurements of chemical abundances.

The fluctuating pressure forces acting on a fluid particle are taken to\nbe a colored noise and follow a stationary process and are described by the\nUhlenbeck-Ornstein model while it appears plausible to take their correlation\ntime to have a power-law dependence on the flow Reynolds number $R_e$, thus\nintroducing a bridge between the Lagrangian quantities and the Eulerian\nparameters for this problem. This ansatz is in qualitative agreement with the\npossibility of a connection speculated earlier by Corrsin [26] between the\nwhite-noise representation for the fluctuating pressure forces and the\nlarge-$R_e$ assumption in the Kolmogorov [4] theory for the 3D fully developed\nturbulence (FDT) as well as the argument of Monin and Yaglom [23] and the\nresult of Sawford [13] and Borgas and Sawford [24] that the Lagrangian\nacceleration is delta-function auto-correlated in the infinite-$R_e$ limit. It\nalso provides an insight into the result that the Richardson-Obukhov scaling\nholds only in the infinite-$R_e$ limit and disappears otherwise. This ansatz\nfurther confirms the Lin-Reid [18] conjecture regarding the connection between\nthe fluctuating pressure-force parameter and the energy dissipation rate in\nturbulence and leads to an $R_e$-dependent explicit relation between the two\nspeculated by Lin and Reid [18]. More specifically, this ansatz provides a\ndetermination of the Richardson-Obukhov constant $g$ as a function of $R_e$,\nwith an asymptotic constant value in the infinite-$R_e$ limit. It is shown to\nlead to full agreement, in the small-$R_e$ limit as well, with the\nBatchelor-Townsend [27] scaling for the rate of change of the mean square\ninterparticle separation in 3D FDT, hence validating its soundness further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 20:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Sep 2012 20:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2013 13:48:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 21:12:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 18:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 18:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-07"}

I discuss recent work on the inferred pair outflow rates, which are in\nexcess of those predicted by existing theories of pair creation, and use those\nresults to point out that the consequent mass loading of the wind reduces the\nwind's bulk flow 4-velocity to the point that dissipation of the magnetic field\nin a pulsar's wind upstream of the termination shock is restored to life as a\nviable model for the solution of the \"sigma problem\".

My\nfindings have recently been questioned through repeat analysis to the United\nKingdom university system. Ferlazzo & Sdoia found that several disciplines in\nthis system also display a scarcity of last names, and that a similar scarcity\nis found when analyzing the first (given) names of Italian professors. Here I\nshow that the scarcity of first names in Italian disciplines is completely\nexplained by uneven male/female representation, while the scarcity of last\nnames in United Kingdom academia is due to discipline-specific immigration.\nHowever, these factors cannot explain the scarcity of last names in Italian\ndisciplines. Geographic and demographic considerations -- proposed as a\npossible explanation of my findings -- appear to have no significant effect:\nafter correcting for these factors, the scarcity of last names remains highly\nsignificant in several disciplines, and there is a marked trend from north to\nsouth, with a higher likelihood of nepotism in the south and in Sicily.\nMoreover, I show that in several Italian disciplines positions tend to be\ninherited as with last names (i.e., from father to son, but not from mother to\ndaughter).

We also observe contextual\nvariations in student beliefs about quantum systems, indicating that\ninstructors who choose to address questions of ontology in quantum mechanics\nshould do so explicitly across a range of topics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 21:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-30"}

There is a\npressing need for scalable and efficient techniques for analyzing this data and\ndiscovering the underlying patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ntechnique which we call vector-field $k$-means.\n  The central idea of our approach is to use vector fields to induce a\nsimilarity notion between trajectories. Other clustering algorithms seek a\nrepresentative trajectory that best describes each cluster, much like $k$-means\nidentifies a representative \"center\" for each cluster. Vector-field $k$-means,\non the other hand, recognizes that in all but the simplest examples, no single\ntrajectory adequately describes a cluster. Our approach is based on the premise\nthat movement trends in trajectory data can be modeled as flows within multiple\nvector fields, and the vector field itself is what defines each of the\nclusters. We also show how vector-field $k$-means connects techniques for\nscalar field design on meshes and $k$-means clustering.\n  We present an algorithm that finds a locally optimal clustering of\ntrajectories into vector fields, and demonstrate how vector-field $k$-means can\nbe used to mine patterns from trajectory data. We present experimental evidence\nof its effectiveness and efficiency using several datasets, including\nhistorical hurricane data, GPS tracks of people and vehicles, and anonymous\ncall records from a large phone company.

Their abundances require a local origin, which however is far\nfrom being understood. We present for the first time the abundances of several\nSLR up to 60Fe predicted from stars with initial mass in the range roughly 7-11\nMsun. These stars evolve through core H, He, and C burning. After core C\nburning they go through a \"Super\"-asymptotic giant branch (Super-AGB) phase,\nwith the H and He shells activated alternately, episodic thermal pulses in the\nHe shell, a very hot temperature at the base of the convective envelope (~ 10^8\nK), and strong stellar winds driving the H-rich envelope into the surrounding\ninterstellar medium. The final remnants of the evolution of Super-AGB stars are\nmostly O-Ne white dwarfs. Our Super-AGB models produce 26Al/27Al yield ratios ~\n0.02 - 0.26. These models can account for the canonical value of the 26Al/27Al\nratio using dilutions with the Solar Nebula of the order of 1 part of Super-AGB\nmass per several 10^2 to several 10^3 of Solar Nebula mass, resulting in\nassociated changes in the O composition in the range 3 permil to 20 permil.\nThis is in agreement with observations of the O isotopic ratios in primitive\nSolar System condensated, which do not carry the signature of a stellar\npollutor. The radionuclides 41Ca and 60Fe are produced by neutron captures in\nSuper-AGB stars and their meteoritic abundances are also matched by some of our\nmodels, depending on the nuclear and stellar physics uncertainties as well as\nthe meteoritic experimental data. We also expect and are currently\ninvestigating Super-AGB production of SLR heavier than iron, such as 107Pd.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 00:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The result leads to the proper electronic energy at all\ninternuclear distances, including the case of separated fragments, and reduces\nto the well-known F\u007forster and Dexter results in their respective limits.\nNumerical calculations of coherent energy and charge transfer dynamics in\nsimple model systems are presented and the effect of collisionally induced\ndecoherence is examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 04:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Higgs field is said to provide mass to all the species of\nelementary constituents - as widely popularized by the media in connection with\nthe recent (most likely) discovery of the Higgs meson at CERN. However, we\nemphasize that the most abundant component of matter - Nucleons - derives its\nmass largely as a consequence of quantum effects of (color gluonic QCD)\nradiation. Further, interestingly this arises out of literally nothing, save\nthe QCD scale determined experimentally, through a self consistent perturbative\nanalysis of nucleon structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 07:46:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2012 12:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-09"}

Most of these baryons\nremain undetected even by the most advanced X-ray observatories which are\nlimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. The Planck satellite\nhas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies via\nthe thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and is an ideal instrument for\nstudying extended low density media through the tSZ effect. In this paper we\nuse the Planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missing\nbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. Cluster pairs are good candidates for\nsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which is\nmore easily observed through the SZ effect). Using an X-ray catalogue of\nclusters and the Planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters as\ncandidates. Using the Planck data we construct a local map of the tSZ effect\ncentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. ROSAT data is used to construct X-ray\nmaps of these pairs. After having modelled and subtracted the tSZ effect and\nX-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both the\nSZ and X-ray maps. For the merging cluster pair A399-A401 we observe a\nsignificant tSZ effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virial\nradii of the clusters. A joint X-ray SZ analysis allows us to constrain the\ntemperature and density of this intercluster medium. We obtain a temperature of\nkT = 7.1 +- 0.9, keV (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon density\nof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3.

Far from just being puzzling constraints on\nour ability to know the state of a quantum system, uncertainty relations are at\nthe heart of why some classically impossible cryptographic primitives become\npossible when quantum communication is allowed. This thesis is concerned with\nstrong notions of uncertainty relations and their applications in quantum\ninformation theory.\n  One operational manifestation of such uncertainty relations is a purely\nquantum effect referred to as information locking. A locking scheme can be\nviewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a uniformly random n-bit message is\nencoded in a quantum system using a classical key of size much smaller than n.\nWithout the key, no measurement of this quantum state can extract more than a\nnegligible amount of information about the message, in which case the message\nis said to be \"locked\". Furthermore, knowing the key, it is possible to\nrecover, that is \"unlock\", the message. We give new efficient constructions of\nbases satisfying strong uncertainty relations leading to the first explicit\nconstruction of an information locking scheme. We also give several other\napplications of our uncertainty relations both to cryptographic and\ncommunication tasks.\n  In addition, we define objects called QC-extractors, that can be seen as\nstrong uncertainty relations that hold against quantum adversaries. We provide\nseveral constructions of QC-extractors, and use them to prove the security of\ncryptographic protocols for two-party computations based on the sole assumption\nthat the parties' storage device is limited in transmitting quantum\ninformation. In doing so, we resolve a central question in the so-called\nnoisy-storage model by relating security to the quantum capacity of storage\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 13:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-30"}

This review\nfocuses on jetted AGN, which constitute the vast majority of AGN detected at\ngamma-ray energies. Future progress will be driven by the planned lower energy\nthreshold for very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray detections to ~10 GeV and\nimproved flux sensitivity compared to current-generation Cherenkov Telescope\nfacilities. We argue that CTA will enable substantial progress on gamma-ray\npopulation studies by deepening existing surveys both through increased flux\nsensitivity and by improving the chances of detecting a larger number of\nlow-frequency peaked blazars because of the lower energy threshold. More\ndetailed studies of the VHE gamma-ray spectral shape and variability might\nfurthermore yield insight into unsolved questions concerning jet formation and\ncomposition, the acceleration of particles within relativistic jets, and the\nmicrophysics of the radiation mechanisms leading to the observable high-energy\nemission. The broad energy range covered by CTA includes energies where\ngamma-rays are unaffected from absorption while propagating in the\nextragalactic background light (EBL), and extends to an energy regime where VHE\nspectra are strongly distorted. This will help to reduce systematic effects in\nthe spectra from different instruments, leading to a more reliable EBL\ndetermination, and hence will make it possible to constrain blazar models up to\nthe highest energies with less ambiguity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 14:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-30"}

N-body simulations taking into account standard type-I planetary\nmigration suggest that protoplanets are captured into mean-motion resonant\norbits near the inner disk edge at which the migration is halted. Previous\nN-body simulations suggested that orbital stability of the resonant systems\ndepends on number of the captured planets. In the unstable case, through close\nscattering and merging between planets, non-resonant multiple systems are\nfinally formed. In this paper, we investigate the critical number of the\nresonantly trapped planets beyond which orbital instability occurs after disk\ngas depletion. We find that when the total number of planets ($N$) is larger\nthan the critical number ($N_{\\rm crit}$), crossing time that is a timescale of\ninitiation of the orbital instability is similar to non-resonant cases, while\nthe orbital instability never occurs within the orbital calculation time\n($10^8$ Kepler time) for $N\\leq N_{\\rm crit}$. Thus, the transition of crossing\ntime across the critical number is drastic. When all the planets are trapped in\n7:6 resonance of adjacent pairs, $N_{\\rm crit} = 4$. We examine the dependence\nof the critical number of 4:3, 6:5 and 8:7 resonance by changing the orbital\nseparation in mutual Hill radii and planetary mass. The critical number\nincreases with increasing the orbital separation in mutual Hill radii with\nfixed planetary mass and increases with increasing planetary mass with fixed\nthe orbital separation in mutual Hill radii. We also calculate the case of a\nsystem which is not composed of the same resonance.

In non-isothermal discs, recent work has\nshown that a decreasing radial profile of the disc entropy can lead to a strong\npositive corotation torque which can significantly slow down or reverse Type I\nmigration in laminar viscous disc models. It is not clear however how this\npicture changes in turbulent disc models. The aim of this study is to examine\nthe impact of turbulence on the torque experienced by a low-mass planet\nembedded in a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc. We particularly focus on the\nrole of turbulence on the corotation torque whose amplitude depends on the\nefficiency of diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe region. We\nperformed 2D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamical code in\nwhich turbulence is modelled as stochastic forcing. In order to provide\nestimations for the viscous and thermal diffusion coefficients as a function of\nthe amplitude of turbulence, we first set up non-isothermal disc models for\ndifferent values of the amplitude of the turbulent forcing. We then include a\nlow-mass planet and determine the evolution of its running time-averaged\ntorque. We show that in non-isothermal discs, the entropy-related corotation\ntorque can indeed remain unsaturated in the presence of turbulence. For\nturbulence amplitudes that do not strongly affect the disc temperature profile,\nwe find that the running time-averaged torque experienced by an embedded\nprotoplanet is in fairly good agreement with laminar disc models with\nappropriate values for the thermal and viscous diffusion coefficients. In discs\nwith turbulence driven by stochastic forcing, the corotation torque therefore\nbehaves similarly as in laminar viscous discs and can be responsible for\nsignificantly slowing down or reversing Type I migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 15:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
