We use\na generic approach for composing graph grammar rules to define a chemically\nuseful rule compositions.

The Helioseismic Magnetic Imager has been\nproviding unprecedented full-disk vector magnetograms covering the rising phase\nof the solar cycle 24.

The\nchanges of fields integrated over the area and the derived change of Lorentz\nforce both show a strong correlation with flare magnitude. It is the first time\nthat such magnetic field changes have been observed even for C-class flares.\nFurthermore, for seven events with associated CMEs, we use an estimate of the\nimpulse provided by the Lorentz force, plus the observed CME velocity, to\nestimate the CME mass.

The accurate determination of the forces acting on the planet\nrequires careful numerical analysis. Recently, the validity of the often used\nfast orbital advection algorithm (FARGO) has been put into question, and\nspecial numerical resolution and stability requirements have been suggested. In\nthis paper we study the process of planet-disk interaction for small mass\nplanets of a few Earth masses, and reanalyze the numerical requirements to\nobtain converged and stable results. One focus lies on the applicability of the\nFARGO-algorithm. Additionally, we study the difference of two and\nthree-dimensional simulations, compare global with local setups, as well as\nisothermal and adiabatic conditions. We study the influence of the planet on\nthe disk through two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. To\nstrengthen our conclusions we perform a detailed numerical comparison where\nseveral upwind and Riemann-solver based codes are used with and without the\nFARGO-algorithm.\n  With respect to the wake structure and the torque density acting on the\nplanet we demonstrate that the FARGO-algorithm yields correct results, and that\nat a fraction of the regular cpu-time. We find that the resolution requirements\nfor achieving convergent results in unshocked regions are rather modest and\ndepend on the pressure scale height of the disk. By comparing the torque\ndensities of 2D and 3D simulations we show that a suitable vertical averaging\nprocedure for the force gives an excellent agreement between the two. We show\nthat isothermal and adiabatic runs can differ considerably, even for adiabatic\nindices very close to unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 18:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In the model, black hole (BH) mass is linearly\nrelated to galaxy mass, and galaxies are connected to dark matter halos via\nempirically constrained relations. A simple \"scattered\" light bulb model for\nquasars is adopted, wherein BHs shine at a fixed fraction of the Eddington\nluminosity during accretion episodes, and Eddington ratios are drawn from a\nlognormal distribution that is redshift-independent. This model has two free,\nphysically meaningful parameters at each redshift: the normalization of the\nMbh-Mgal relation and the quasar duty cycle; these parameters are fit to the\nobserved quasar luminosity function (LF) over the interval 0.5<z<6. This simple\nmodel provides an excellent fit to the LF at all epochs, and also successfully\npredicts the observed projected two-point correlation of quasars from\n0.5<z<2.5. It is significant that a single quasar duty cycle at each redshift\nis capable of reproducing the extant observations. The data are therefore\nconsistent with a scenario wherein quasars are equally likely to exist in\ngalaxies, and therefore dark matter halos, over a wide range in masses. The\nknee in the quasar LF is a reflection of the knee in the stellar mass-halo mass\nrelation. Future constraints on the quasar LF and quasar clustering at high\nredshift will provide strong constraints on the model. In the model, the\nautocorrelation function of quasars becomes a strong function of luminosity\nonly at the very highest luminosities, and will be difficult to observe because\nsuch quasars are so rare. Cross-correlation techniques may provide useful\nconstraints on the bias of such rare objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 17:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Over time\nthe mesh is deformed by gravitational forces, causing the tetrahedral cells to\nwarp and overlap. The new methods are well suited to visualize the cosmic web.\nIn particular they preserve caustics, regions of high density that emerge, when\nseveral streams of dark matter particles share the same location in space,\nindicating the formation of structures like sheets, filaments and halos.

In this setting, it is\nknown that one may choose (under a mild integrability assumption) a decision\nstrategy whose pathwise time-average loss is asymptotically smaller than that\nof any other strategy. The corresponding problem in the case of partial\ninformation proves to be much more delicate, however: if the process X is not\nobservable, but decisions must be based on the observation of a different\nprocess Y, the existence of pathwise optimal strategies is not guaranteed.\n  The aim of this paper is to exhibit connections between pathwise optimal\nstrategies and notions from ergodic theory. The sequential decision problem is\ndeveloped in the general setting of an ergodic dynamical system (\\Omega,B,P,T)\nwith partial information Y\\subseteq B. The existence of pathwise optimal\nstrategies grounded in two basic properties: the conditional ergodic theory of\nthe dynamical system, and the complexity of the loss function. When the loss\nfunction is not too complex, a general sufficient condition for the existence\nof pathwise optimal strategies is that the dynamical system is a conditional\nK-automorphism relative to the past observations \\bigvee_n T^n Y. If the\nconditional ergodicity assumption is strengthened, the complexity assumption\ncan be weakened. Several examples demonstrate the interplay between complexity\nand ergodicity, which does not arise in the case of full information. Our\nresults also yield a decision-theoretic characterization of weak mixing in\nergodic theory, and establish pathwise optimality of ergodic nonlinear filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 20:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

This pattern\nis consistent with some verbal theory of ecological opportunity and adaptive\nradiations. One often-overlooked source of bias in these studies is that of\nsampling at the level of whole clades, as researchers tend to choose large,\nspeciose clades to study. In this paper, we investigate the performance of\ncommon methods across the distribution of clade sizes that can be generated by\na constant-rate birth-death process. Clades which are larger than expected for\na given constant-rate branching process tend to show a pattern of an early\nburst even when both speciation and extinction rates are constant through time.\nAll methods evaluated were susceptible to detecting this false signature when\nextinction was low. Under moderate extinction, both the gamma-statistic and\ndiversity-dependent models did not detect such a slowdown but only because the\nsignature of a slowdown was masked by subsequent extinction. Some models which\nestimate time-varying speciation rates are able to detect early bursts under\nhigher extinction rates, but are extremely prone to sampling bias. We suggest\nthat examining clades in isolation may result in spurious inferences that rates\nof diversification have changed through time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 20:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Two types of domain wall structures (phases of the wall) exist\ndepending on the wall orientation. The low-energy 'achiral' phase occurs in the\nvicinity of the {110} wall orientation and has odd polarization profile\ninvariant with respect to inversion about the wall center. The second 'chiral'\nphase occurs around {211} wall orientations and corresponds to mixed parity\ndomain walls that may be of left-handed or right-handed chirality. The\ntransformation between the phases is abrupt, accompanied with 20-30% change of\nthe domain wall thickness and can happen at fixed wall orientation with\ntemperature change. We suggest that the phase transition may be detected\nthrough domain wall thickness change or by c-AFM.

Focusing on $N$-point\nsets that achieve optimal order QMC error bounds (as is the case for efficient\nspherical designs), we are led to introduce the concept of QMC designs: these\nare sequences of $N$-point node sets $X_N$ on $S^d$ such that the worst-case\nerror of the corresponding QMC rules satisfy a bound of order $O(N^{-s/d})$ as\n$N\\to\\infty$ with an implied constant that depends on the $H^s(S^d)$-norm.\n  We provide methods for generation and numerical testing of QMC designs.

The goal is to decide when the Markov chain hits a specific\ntarget state. The decision maker can choose from a finite set of sampling\nintervals to pick the next time to look at the Markov chain. The aim is to\noptimize an objective comprising of false alarm, delay cost and cumulative\nmeasurement sampling cost. Taking more frequent measurements yields accurate\nestimates but incurs a higher measurement cost. Making an erroneous decision\ntoo soon incurs a false alarm penalty. Waiting too long to declare the target\nstate incurs a delay penalty. What is the optimal sequential strategy for the\ndecision maker? The paper shows that under reasonable conditions, the optimal\nstrategy has the following intuitive structure: when the Bayesian estimate\n(posterior distribution) of the Markov chain is away from the target state,\nlook less frequently; while if the posterior is close to the target state, look\nmore frequently. Bounds are derived for the optimal strategy. Also the\nachievable optimal cost of the sequential detector as a function of transition\ndynamics and observation distribution is analyzed. The sensitivity of the\noptimal achievable cost to parameter variations is bounded in terms of the\nKullback divergence.

A\npromising opportunity may arise with the X-ray Imaging Polarimetry Explorer\n(XIPE) mission, which has been proposed to ESA in response to a small-size\n(S-class) mission call due for launch in 2017.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 08:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The plasmon frequency \\omega_p is determined as functions of the\ntransferred momentum $q_{\\parallel}$ along the hexagonal plane in the Brillouin\nzone and its perpendicular component $q_z$. These plasmons are isotropic within\nthe plane in the long wavelength limit. As the in-plane transferred momentum is\nincreased, the plasmon frequency strongly depends on its magnitude and\ndirection (\\phi). With increasing angle, the dispersion relation within the\nhexagonal plane is gradually changed from quadratic to nearly linear form.\nThere are many significant differences for the \\pi-plasmon dispersion relations\nbetween 2D graphene and 3D AA-stacked graphite. They include $q_\\parallel$- and\n\\phi-dependence and \\pi-plasmon bandwidth. This result reveals that interlayer\ninteraction could enhance anisotropy of in-plane \\pi-plasmons. For chosen\n$\\textbf{q}_\\parallel$, we also obtain the plasmon frequency as a function of\n$q_z$ and show that there is an upper bound on $q_z$ for plasmons to exist in\ngraphite. Additionally, the group velocity for plasmon propagation along the\nperpendicular direction may be positive or negative depending on the choice of\n$\\textbf{q}_\\parallel$. Consequently, the forward and backward propagation of\n\\pi-plasmons in AA-stacked graphite in which the energy flow is respectively\nparallel or antiparallel to the transferred momentum, can be realized. The\nbackward flowing resonance is an intrinsic property of AA-stacked graphite,\narising from the energy band structure and the interlayer coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 12:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

When the\nincrements $(X_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ are a one-order Markov chain, a short\nmemory is introduced in the dynamics of $(S_t)$. This so-called \"persistent\"\nrandom walk is nolonger Markovian and, under suitable conditions, the rescaled\nprocess converges towards the integrated telegraph noise (ITN) as the\ntime-scale and space-scale parameters tend to zero (see Herrmann and Vallois,\n2010; Tapiero-Vallois, Tapiero-Vallois2}). The ITN process is effectively\nnon-Markovian too. The aim is to consider persistent random walks $(S_t)$ whose\nincrements are Markov chains with variable order which can be infinite. This\nvariable memory is enlighted by a one-to-one correspondence between $(X_n)$ and\na suitable Variable Length Markov Chain (VLMC), since for a VLMC the dependency\nfrom the past can be unbounded.\n  The key fact is to consider the non Markovian letter process $(X_n)$ as the\nmargin of a couple $(X_n,M_n)_{n\\ge 0}$ where $(M_n)_{n\\ge 0}$ stands for the\nmemory of the process $(X_n)$. We prove that, under a suitable rescaling,\n$(S_n,X_n,M_n)$ converges in distribution towards a time continuous process\n$(S^0(t),X(t),M(t))$. The process $(S^0(t))$ is a semi-Markov and Piecewise\nDeterministic Markov Process whose paths are piecewise linear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 12:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-17"}

Stars show a very wide\nvariety of magnetic properties in terms of strength, geometry or variability.\nCool stars generate their magnetic fields by dynamo effect, and their\nproperties appear to correlate - to some extent - with stellar parameters such\nas mass, rotation and age. With the improvements of instrumentation and data\nanalysis techniques, magnetic fields can now be detected and studied down to\nthe domain of very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, triggering new theoretical\nworks aimed, in particular, at modelling dynamo action in these objects. After\na brief discussion on the importance of magnetic field in stellar physics, the\nbasics of dynamo theory and magnetic field measurements are presented. The main\nresults stemming from observational and theoretical studies of magnetism are\nthen detailed in two parts: the fully-convective transition, and the very-low\nmass stars and brown dwarfs domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 13:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We use 13 galaxy clusters\nuniformly selected from 178 deg^2 observed with the South Pole Telescope (SPT)\nand followed up by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. They form an approximately\nmass-limited sample (> 3 x 10^14 M_sun h^-1_70) spanning redshifts 0.3 < z <\n1.1. Using previously published X-ray-selected cluster samples, we compare two\nproxies of cool-core strength: surface brightness concentration (cSB) and\ncuspiness ({\\alpha}). We find that cSB is better constrained. We measure cSB\nfor the SPT sample and find several new z > 0.5 cool-core clusters, including\ntwo strong cool cores. This rules out the hypothesis that there are no z > 0.5\nclusters that qualify as strong cool cores at the 5.4{\\sigma} level. The\nfraction of strong cool-core clusters in the SPT sample in this redshift regime\nis between 7% and 56% (95% confidence). Although the SPT selection function is\nsignificantly different from the X-ray samples, the high-z cSB distribution for\nthe SPT sample is statistically consistent with that of X-ray-selected samples\nat both low and high redshifts. The cool-core strength is inversely correlated\nwith the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the X-ray centroid,\nproviding evidence that the dynamical state affects the cool-core strength of\nthe cluster. Larger SZ-selected samples will be crucial in understanding the\nevolution of cluster cool cores over cosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 13:50:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Oct 2012 17:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Dec 2012 17:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-10"}

Our goal is to improve the\nstudy of the combined radio-optical data by investigating if there is a\ncorrelation between the radio luminosity at 20 cm over the luminosity of the\noptical H\\alpha line (L[20 cm]/L[H\\alpha]) and line excitation ratios, where\nthe latter provide the spectroscopic classification in Seyferts, low-ionization\nnuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) and star-forming galaxies. We found that\nthe percentage of detected AGNs (Seyferts and LINERs) or composites is much\nhigher in the optical-radio sample than in the optical sample alone. There is a\nprogressive shift of the sources towards the AGN region of the diagram with\nincreasing L[20 cm]/L[H\\alpha], with an indication for a different behavior for\nLINERs and Seyferts. The classification appears to slightly depend on the\nredshift. A comparison with photoionization and shock models shows that the\nlarge fraction of LINERs identified in our study have emission lines that may\nbe explained by shocks. The [NII]/H\\alpha vs. equivalent width of the H\\alpha\nline (WHAN) diagram confirms the LINER classification for most of those that\nhave been identified with the traditional diagnostic diagrams.

Most analyses of these\ndistortions focus on the signatures of hitchhiking due to hard or soft\nselective sweeps at a single genetic locus. However, in linked regions of\nrapidly adapting genomes, multiple beneficial mutations at different loci can\nsegregate simultaneously within the population, an effect known as clonal\ninterference. This leads to a subtle interplay between hitchhiking and\ninterference effects, which leads to a unique signature of rapid adaptation on\ngenetic variation both at the selected sites and at linked neutral loci. Here,\nwe introduce an effective coalescent theory (a \"fitness-class coalescent\") that\ndescribes how positive selection at many perfectly linked sites alters the\nstructure of genealogies. We use this theory to calculate several simple\nstatistics describing genetic variation within a rapidly adapting population,\nand to implement efficient backwards-time coalescent simulations which can be\nused to predict how clonal interference alters the expected patterns of\nmolecular evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 14:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-17"}

We show that the edge magnetic moment varies as ln U\nand uncover its dependence on the width W of the ribbon. The physics of this\nowes its origin to the sensory organ like response of the nanoribbons,\ndemonstrating that considerations beyond the usual Stoner-Landau theory are\nnecessary to understand the magnetism of these systems. A first order magnetic\ntransition from an anti-parallel orientation of the moments on opposite edges\nto a parallel orientation occurs upon doping with holes or electrons. The\ncritical doping for this transition is shown to depend inversely on the width\nof the ribbon. Using variational Monte-Carlo calculations, we show that\nmagnetism is robust to fluctuations.

Furthermore, we perform first principles modeling to show how such\nmagnetic transitions can be realized in substituted graphene nanoribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 15:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
