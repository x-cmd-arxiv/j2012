For\nexample, in terms of the structural behavior of graphene or bi-layer graphene\nat high bias, little to nothing is known. To this end we investigated bi-layer\ngraphene constrictions with closed edges (seamless) at high bias using in situ\natomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. We directly observe a\nhighly localized anomalously large lattice expansion inside the constriction.\nBoth the current density and lattice expansion increase as the bi-layer\ngraphene constriction narrows. As the constriction width decreases below 10 nm,\nshortly before failure, the current density rises to 4 \\cdot 109 A cm-2 and the\nconstriction exhibits a lattice expansion with a uniaxial component showing an\nexpansion approaching 5 % and an isotropic component showing an expansion\nexceeding 1 %. The origin of the lattice expansion is hard to fully ascribe to\nthermal expansion. Impact ionization is a process in which charge carriers\ntransfer from bonding states to antibonding states thus weakening bonds. The\naltered character of C-C bonds by impact ionization could explain the\nanomalously large lattice expansion we observe in seamless bi-layer graphene\nconstrictions. Moreover, impact ionization might also contribute to the\nobserved anisotropy in the lattice expansion, although strain is probably the\npredominant factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 16:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}

The\npresence of a sphere on which radiation pressure balances gravity for static\nparticles was first discovered some twenty five years ago.

Despite its\npotential, the intrinsic long scan times of these sequences have hampered their\nuse in clinical practice. For this reason, a large variety of methods have been\nrecently proposed to shorten the acquisition times. Among them, spherical\ndeconvolution approaches have gained a lot of interest for their ability to\nreliably recover the intra-voxel fiber configuration with a relatively small\nnumber of data samples. To overcome the intrinsic instabilities of\ndeconvolution, these methods use regularization schemes generally based on the\nassumption that the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) to be recovered in\neach voxel is sparse. The well known Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)\napproach resorts to Tikhonov regularization, based on an l2-norm prior, which\npromotes a weak version of sparsity. Also, in the last few years compressed\nsensing has been advocated to further accelerate the acquisitions and l1-norm\nminimization is generally employed as a means to promote sparsity in the\nrecovered FODs. In this paper, we provide evidence that the use of an l1-norm\nprior to regularize this class of problems is somewhat inconsistent with the\nfact that the fiber compartments all sum up to unity. To overcome this l1\ninconsistency while simultaneously exploiting sparsity more optimally than\nthrough an l2 prior, we reformulate the reconstruction problem as a constrained\nformulation between a data term and and a sparsity prior consisting in an\nexplicit bound on the l0 norm of the FOD, i.e. on the number of fibers.

A common thread to most genetic\ninvestigations is familial relationships. Close relatives can be identified\nfrom family records, and more distant relatives can be inferred from large\npanels of genetic markers. Unfortunately these empirical estimates can be\nnoisy, especially regarding distant relatives. We propose a new method for\ndenoising genetically - inferred relationship matrices by exploiting the\nunderlying structure due to hierarchical groupings of correlated individuals.\nThe approach, which we call Treelet Covariance Smoothing, employs a multiscale\ndecomposition of covariance matrices to improve estimates of pairwise\nrelationships. On both simulated and real data, we show that smoothing leads to\nbetter estimates of the relatedness amongst distantly related individuals. We\nillustrate our method with a large genome-wide association study and estimate\nthe \"heritability\" of body mass index quite accurately. Traditionally\nheritability, defined as the fraction of the total trait variance attributable\nto additive genetic effects, is estimated from samples of closely related\nindividuals using random effects models. We show that by using smoothed\nrelationship matrices we can estimate heritability using population-based\nsamples. Finally, while our methods have been developed for refining genetic\nrelationship matrices and improving estimates of heritability, they have much\nbroader potential application in statistics. Most notably, for\nerror-in-variables random effects models and settings that require\nregularization of matrices with block or hierarchical structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 19:19:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2013 06:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-11"}

The new data offer a fourfold increase in\nrecorded luminosity, providing higher precision and a larger reach in\ntransverse momentum, p_T, to 20 GeV/c. The production ratio of eta/pi^0 is\n0.46+/-0.01(stat)+/-0.05(syst), constant with p_T and collision centrality. The\nobserved ratio is consistent with earlier measurements, as well as with the p+p\nand d+Au values. The production of pi^0 is suppressed by a factor of 5, as in\nearlier findings.

Our models of HD\n209458b indicate that magnetic effects can substantially slow down atmospheric\nwinds, change circulation and temperature patterns, and alter observable\nproperties. These models establish that longitudinal and latitudinal hot spot\noffsets, day-night flux contrasts, and planetary radius inflation are\ninterrelated diagnostics of the magnetic induction process occurring in the\natmospheres of hot Jupiters and other similarly forced exoplanets.

A specific such algorithm is Fisher\ndiscriminant analysis (FDA), the classification accuracy of which has been\npreviously studied in the context of wireless sensor networks. Previous work,\nhowever, does not take into account the communication protocol or battery\nlifetime of the sensor networks; in this paper we extend the existing studies\nby proposing a model that captures the relationship between battery lifetime\nand classification accuracy. In order to do so we combine the FDA with a model\nthat captures the dynamics of the Carrier-Sense Multiple-Access (CSMA)\nalgorithm, the random-access algorithm used to regulate communications in\nsensor networks. This allows us to study the interaction between the\nclassification accuracy, battery lifetime and effort put towards learning, as\nwell as the impact of the back-off rates of CSMA on the accuracy. We\ncharacterize the tradeoff between the length of the training stage and\naccuracy, and show that accuracy is non-monotone in the back-off rate due to\nchanges in the training sample size and overfitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 20:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

However, we\ndemonstrate that they are indeed not far from the realm of being measurable.\nThey could be used to validate Einsteinian general relativity or to give\nvaluable information on the true dynamical nature of gravity. One fundamental\nquestion, for example, is a direct measurement the speed of propagation of\ngravitational effects and the verification that it is indeed the same as the\nspeed of light. We propose a simple laboratory experiment that could affirm or\ndeny this proposition. We also analyze the possibility of the detection of\nlarge geophysical events, such as earthquakes. We find that large seismic\nevents seem to be easily observable with the present ensemble of gravitational\nwave detectors,. The ensemble of gravitational wave detectors could easily\nserve as a system of early warning for otherwise catastrophic seismic events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 22:21:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 19:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 05:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2022 00:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

They cause degrading the performance of\nthe network, and disturbing the continuous communication process. To overcome\nthese issues, one step towards this dilemma has been taken in form of\nPre-congestion notification (PCN) technique. PCN uses a packet marking\ntechnique within a PCN domain over IP networks. It is notified by egress node\nthat works as guard at entry point of network. Egress node gives feedback to\ncommunicating servers whether rate on the link is exceeded than configured\nadmissible threshold or within the limit. Based on this feedback, admission\ndecisions are taken to determine whether to allow/block new coming flows or\nterminate already accepted. The actual question is about selection of right\nalgorithm for PCN domain. In this paper, we investigate the analytical behavior\nof some known PCN algorithms. We make slide modifications in originality of PCN\nalgorithms without disquieting working process in order to employ those within\nsimilar types of scenarios. Our goal is to simulate them either in highly\ncongested or less congested realistic scenarios. On the basis of simulation\ndone in ns2, we are able to recommend each PCN algorithm for specific\nconditions. Finally, we develop a benchmark that helps researchers and\nscientific communities to pick the right algorithm. Furthermore, the benchmark\nis designed to achieve specific objectives according to the users' requirements\nwithout congesting the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2012 06:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

There have been many studies analyzing the\nimpact of different population sizes on the performance of EAs. However, most\nof such studies are based computational experiments, except for a few cases.\nThe common wisdom so far appears to be that a large population would increase\nthe population diversity and thus help an EA. Indeed, increasing the population\nsize has been a commonly used strategy in tuning an EA when it did not perform\nas well as expected for a given problem. He and Yao (2002) showed theoretically\nthat for some problem instance classes, a population can help to reduce the\nruntime of an EA from exponential to polynomial time. This paper analyzes the\nrole of population further in EAs and shows rigorously that large populations\nmay not always be useful.

Although the theoretical analysis was\ncarried out on one multi-modal problem using a specific type of EAs, it has\nmuch wider implications.

Although a short-lived RS has\nbeen widely considered, the RS is believed to be long-lived as a consequence of\na stratification expected on the ejecta Lorentz factors. The existence of a\nlong-lived RS makes the forward shock (FS) dynamics to deviate from a\nself-similar Blandford-McKee solution. Employing the \"mechanical model\" that\ncorrectly incorporates the energy conservation, we present an accurate solution\nfor both the FS and RS dynamics. We conduct a sophisticated calculation of the\nafterglow emission. Adopting a Lagrangian description of the blast wave, we\nkeep track of an adiabatic evolution of numerous shells between the FS and RS.\nAn evolution of the electron spectrum is also followed individually for every\nshell. We then find the FS and RS light curves by integrating over the entire\nFS and RS shocked regions, respectively. In particular, we make use of an\nanalytic expression for observed spectral flux, which we derive here in terms\nof an observed frequency and observer time. Exploring a total of 20 different\nejecta stratifications, we explain in detail how a stratified ejecta affects\nits blast wave dynamics and afterglow light curves. We show that, while the FS\nlight curves are not sensitive to the ejecta stratifications, the RS light\ncurves exhibit much richer features, including steep declines, plateaus, bumps,\nre-brightenings, and a variety of temporal decay indices. These distinctive RS\nfeatures may be observable if the RS has higher values of the micophysics\nparameters than the FS.

This is associated with the interesting fact\nthat the SU(3) Kondo effect does not occur at the particle-hole symmetric\npoint, where the system is found instead in the valence-fluctuating regime with\nthe total dot occupancy flipping between 1 and 2, but for gate voltages in the\ntwo Kondo plateaux where the dot occupancy is pinned to an integer value,\neither 1 or 2. From the thermodynamic analysis in the Kondo regime we find that\nthe effective impurity orbital moment, defined through the impurity orbital\nsusceptibility (chi_imp) multiplied by the temperature, is T\\chi_imp=1 at high\ntemperatures and then it increases to the characteristic value of T\\chi_imp=4/3\ncorresponding to the three-fold degenerate local-moment fixed point where the\nimpurity entropy is S_imp=ln 3.

Using a well-studied data set with\n16 exemplars that exhibit the Guppy Effect, we developed a 17-dimensional\ncomplex Hilbert space H that models the data and demonstrates the relationship\nbetween overextension and interference.

This may be true for some new technologies, for example the\ncell phone, but not for others, like the blue-ray. Novelty, usefulness,\nadvertising, price, and fashion are the driving forces behind the adoption of a\nnew product. But, what are the key factors that lead to adopt a new technology?\nIn this paper we propose and investigate a simple model for the adoption of an\ninnovation which depends mainly on three elements: the appeal of the novelty,\nthe inertia or resistance to adopt it, and the interaction with other agents.\nSocial interactions are taken into account in two ways: by imitation and by\ndifferentiation, i.e., some agents will be inclined to adopt an innovation if\nmany people do the same, but other will act in the opposite direction, trying\nto differentiate from the \"herd\". We determine the conditions for a successful\nimplantation of the new technology, by considering the strength of advertising\nand the effect of social interactions. We find a balance between the\nadvertising and the number of anti-herding agents that may block the adoption\nof a new product. We also compare the effect of social interactions, when\nagents take into account the behavior of the whole society or just a part of\nit. In a nutshell, the present model reproduces qualitatively the available\ndata on adoption of innovation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 17:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

We found that the amplitude of an even-numbered cycle of the\nnumber of large groups is smaller than that of its immediately following\nodd-numbered cycle. This is consistent with the well known Gnevyshev and Ohl\nrule or G-O rule of solar cycles, generally described by using the Zurich\nsunspot number (Rz). During cycles 12-21 the G-O rule holds good for the\nvariation in the number of small groups also, but it is violated by cycle pair\n(22, 23) as in the case of Rz. This behaviour of the variations in the small\ngroups is largely responsible for the anomalous behaviour of Rz in cycle pair\n(22, 23). It is also found that the amplitude of an odd-numbered cycle of the\nnumber of small groups is larger than that of its immediately following\neven-numbered cycle. This can be called as `reverse G-O rule'. In the case of\nthe number of the big groups, both cycle pairs (12, 13) and (22, 23) violated\nthe G-O rule. In many cycles the positions of the peaks of the small, large,\nand big groups are different and considerably differ with respect to the\ncorresponding positions of the Rz peaks. In the case of cycle 23, the\ncorresponding cycles of the small and large groups are largely symmetric/less\nasymmetric (Waldmeier effect is weak/absent) with their maxima taking place two\nyears later than that of Rz. The corresponding cycle of the big groups is more\nasymmetric (strong Waldmeier effect) with its maximum epoch taking place at the\nsame time as that of Rz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2012 09:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
