First, a tensor network\nrepresentation of a complete, orthonormal set of ground states on a cylinder of\ninfinite length and finite width is obtained through numerical optimization.\nEach of these ground states is argued to have a different anyonic flux\nthreading through the cylinder. In a chiral phase, the entanglement spectrum of\neach ground state is seen to reveal a different sector of the corresponding\ngapless edge theory. A quasi-orthogonal basis on the torus is then produced by\nchopping off and reconnecting the tensor network representation on the\ncylinder. Elaborating on the recent proposal of [Y. Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. B\n85, 235151 (2012)], a rotation on the torus yields an alternative basis of\nground states and, through the computation of overlaps between bases, the\nmodular matrices S and U (containing the mutual and self statistics of the\ndifferent anyon species) are extracted. As an application, we study the\nhard-core boson Haldane model by using the two-dimensional density matrix\nrenormalization group.

As expressed by d'Alembert's\nfamous paradox, an ideal fluid does not exert drag on bodies past which it\nflows, or in other words, it does not exchange momentum with them. Also, the\nflow of an ideal fluid does not dissipate kinetic energy. We study\nexperimentally whether these properties apply to the flow of superfluid 3He-B\nin a rotating cylinder at low temperatures. It is found that ideal behavior is\nbroken by quantum turbulence, which leads to substantial energy dissipation, as\nobserved also earlier. Here we show that remarkably, nearly ideal behavior is\npreserved with respect to the angular-momentum exchange between the superfluid\nand its container, i.e., the drag almost disappears in the zero-temperature\nlimit. This mismatch between energy and angular-momentum transfer results in a\nnew physical situation where the proper description of wall-bounded quantum\nturbulence requires two effective friction parameters, one for energy\ndissipation and another for momentum coupling, which become substantially\ndifferent at very low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 17:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 19:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-20"}

We have applied this\nrenormalization method in the non-perturbative calculation of phase-shifts for\nnucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering using chiral NN potentials up to\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO). For lower partial waves, we find\nthat there is either no convergence with increasing order or, if convergence\noccurs, the results do not always converge to the empirical values. For higher\npartial waves, we always observe convergence to the empirical phase shifts\n(except for the 3G5 state). Furthermore, no matter what the order is, one can\nuse only one or no counterterm per partial wave, creating a rather erratic\nscheme of power counting that does not allow for a systematic order-by-order\nimprovement of the predictions. The conclusion is that infinite-cutoff\nrenormalization is inappropriate for chiral NN interactions, which should not\ncome as a surprise, since the chiral effective field theory, these interactions\nare based upon, is designed for momenta below the chiral-symmetry breaking\nscale of about 1 GeV. Therefore, this value for the hard scale should also be\nperceived as the appropriate upper limit for the momentum cutoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 18:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

By using nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics diagnostics such as material entropy production, efficiency,\nmeridional heat transport and kinetic energy dissipation we characterize in a\nnew way the different circulation regimes. Baroclinic circulations feature high\nmechanical dissipation, meridional heat transport, material entropy pro-\nduction and are fairly efficient in converting heat into mechanical work. The\nthermal dissipation associated with the sensible heat flux is found to depend\nmainly on the surface properties, almost independent from the rotation rate and\nvery low for quasi-barotropic circulations and regimes approaching equa- torial\nsuper-rotation.

We argue that composite models\nare the preferred means of generating such a large dipole moment, and that the\nmagnetic case is more natural than the electric one. We present a simple model\ninvolving a scalar and fermionic techniquark of a confining SU(2) gauge\nsymmetry. We point out some generic challenges for getting such a model to\nwork. The new physics leading to a sufficiently large dipole moment is below\nthe TeV scale, indicating that the magnetic moment is not a valid effective\noperator for LHC physics, and that production of the strongly interacting\nconstituents, followed by techni-hadronization, is a more likely signature than\nmonophoton events. In particular, 4-photon events from the decays of bound\nstate pairs are predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 19:59:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 19:45:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 00:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

ATLAS aims to\nreach a uniform sensitivity of $10 \\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ rms over the entire\nregion with data release 1 currently reaching $\\sim30 \\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ rms.\nHere we present 466 new spectroscopic redshifts for radio sources in ATLAS as\npart of our optical follow-up program. Of the 466 radio sources with new\nspectroscopic redshifts, 142 have star-forming optical spectra, 282 show\nevidence for AGN in their optical spectra, 10 have stellar spectra and 32 have\nspectra revealing redshifts, but with insufficient features to classify. We\ncompare our spectroscopic classifications with two mid-infrared diagnostics and\nfind them to be in broad agreement. We also construct the radio luminosity\nfunction for star-forming galaxies to z $= 0.5$ and for AGN to z $= 0.8$. The\nradio luminosity function for star-forming galaxies appears to be in good\nagreement with previous studies. The radio luminosity function for AGN appears\nhigher than previous studies of the local AGN radio luminosity function. We\nexplore the possibility of evolution, cosmic variance and classification\ntechniques affecting the AGN radio luminosity function. ATLAS is a pathfinder\nfor the forthcoming EMU survey and the data presented in this paper will be\nused to guide EMU's survey design and early science papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 22:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The degeneracy of the mapping $f$ will\nbe characterized in terms of the ranks of the CR second fundamental form and\nits covariant derivatives. In 2004, the author, together with X.

A key step in the proof of this result was to show that\ndegenerate mappings are necessarily contained a complex plane section of the\ntarget sphere (partial rigidity). In the 2004 paper, it was shown that if the\ntotal rank $d$ of the second fundamental form and all of its covariant\nderivatives is $<n$ (here, $n$ is the CR dimension of $M$), then $f(M)$ is\ncontained in a complex plane of dimension $n+d+1$.

The pressor and the tractor forces are\noriented along the beam's direction of propagation and opposite to it,\nrespectively. The behavior of the acoustic radiation force generated by Bessel\nbeams when the sphere lies outside the beam's axis (off-axial configuration) is\nunknown. Using the 3D radiation force formulas given in terms of the partial\nwave expansion coefficients for the incident and scattered waves, both axial\nand transverse components of the force exerted on a silicone-oil sphere are\nobtained for a zero- and a first-order Bessel vortex beam. As the sphere\ndeparts from the beam's axis, the tractor force becomes weaker. Moreover, the\nbehavior of the transverse radiation force field may vary with the sphere's\nsize factor $ka$ (where $k$ is the wavenumber and $a$ is the sphere radius).\nBoth stable and unstable equilibrium regions around the beam's axis are found\ndepending on $ka$ values. These results are particularly important for the\ndesign of acoustical tractor beam devices operating with Bessel beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 00:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-15"}

When scattering haze and/or cloud\nparticles are present in the planetary atmosphere, the amount of transmitted\nflux not only depends on the total optical thickness of the slant light path\nthat is probed, but also on the amount of forward-scattering by the scattering\nparticles. Here, we present results of calculations with a three-dimensional\nMonte Carlo code that simulates the transmitted flux during occultations or\ntransits. For isotropically scattering particles, like gas molecules, the\ntransmitted flux appears to be well-described by the total atmospheric optical\nthickness. Strongly forward-scattering particles, however, such as commonly\nfound in atmospheres of Solar System planets, can increase the transmitted flux\nsignificantly. For exoplanets, such added flux can decrease the apparent radius\nof the planet by several scale heights, which is comparable to predicted and\nmeasured features in exoplanet transit spectra. We performed detailed\ncalculations for Titan's atmosphere between 2.0 and 2.8 micron and show that\nhaze and gas abundances will be underestimated by about 8% if\nforward-scattering is ignored in the retrievals. At shorter wavelengths, errors\nin the gas and haze abundances and in the spectral slope of the haze particles\ncan be several tens of percent, also for other Solar System planetary\natmospheres.

Structural and recent\nsingle-molecule assays have provided dynamic details of polymerase machinery\nwith insight into information processing. We introduce a rigorous\ncharacterization of Shannon Information in biomolecular systems and apply it to\nDNA replication in the limit of no dissipation. Specifically, we devise an\nequilibrium pathway in DNA replication to determine the entropy generated in\ncopying the information from a DNA template in the absence of friction. Both\nthe initial state, the free nucleotides randomly distributed in certain\nconcentrations, and the final state, a polymerized strand, are mesoscopic\nequilibrium states for the nucleotide distribution. We use empirical stacking\nfree energies to calculate the probabilities of incorporation of the\nnucleotides. The copied strand is, to first order of approximation, a state of\nindependent and non-indentically distributed random variables for which the\nnucleotide that is incorporated by the polymerase at each step is dictated by\nthe template strand, and to second order of approximation, a state of\nnon-uniformly distributed random variables with nearest-neighbor interactions\nfor which the recognition of secondary structure by the polymerase in the\nresultant double-stranded polymer determines the entropy of the replicated\nstrand. Two incorporation mechanisms arise naturally and their biological\nmeanings are explained. It is known that replication occurs far from\nequilibrium and therefore the Shannon entropy here derived represents an upper\nbound for replication to take place. Likewise, this entropy sets a universal\nlower bound for the copying fidelity in replication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 07:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-15"}

We moreover give\nexplicit formulas for algebraic connections on a class of finitely generated\nprojective modules on ellipsoid surfaces. The connections we construct are\nnon-flat with trace of curvature equal to zero. We construct these formulas\nusing an idempotent matrix $M$ defining the module $E$. Such an idempotent\nmatrix $M$ is constructed from a \"projective basis\" $B$ defining the module\n$E$. Associated to a projective basis $B$ for $E$ we construct a connection\n$\\nabla_B$.

More than one hundred GeV pulsars have been detected up to now by\nthe LAT telescope on the Fermi gamma-ray observatory, showing peak energies\naround a few GeV. Current modelling proposes that the high energy emission\ncomes from outer magnetospheric gaps, however radiation from the equatorial\ncurrent sheet which separates the two magnetic hemispheres outside the light\ncylinder has also been investigated. Aims. In this paper we discuss the region\nright outside the light cylinder, or \"near wind\" zone. We investigate the\npossibility that synchrotron radiation emitted by thermal populations in the\nequatorial current sheet of the pulsar wind in this region can explain the\nlightcurves and spectra observed by Fermi/LAT. Methods. We use analytical\nestimates as well as detailed numerical computation to calculate the gamma-ray\nluminosities, lightcurves and spectra of gamma-ray pulsars. Results. Many of\nthe characteristics of the gamma-ray pulsars observed by Fermi/LAT can be\nreproduced by our model, most notably the position of these objects in the P -\nPdot diagram, and the range of gamma-ray luminosities. A testable result is a\nsub-exponential cutoff with an index b = 0.35. We also predict the existence of\na population of pulsars with cutoff energies in the MeV range. These have\nsystematically lower spindown luminosities than the Fermi/LAT detected pulsars.\nConclusions. It is possible for relativistic populations of electrons and\npositrons in the current sheet of a pulsar's wind right outside the light\ncylinder to emit synchrotron radiation that peaks in the sub-GeV to GeV regime,\nwith gamma-ray efficiencies similar to those observed for the Fermi/LAT\npulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 09:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In this work,\nthe enzyme (glucose oxidase (GOX)) was immobilized on the surface of a nanotube\nnetwork, which was created by the deposition of nanotubes from their solution\nin 1,2-dichlorobenzene by the spray method. 1-Pyrenebutanoic acid succinimide\nester (PSE) was used to form the molecular interface, the bifunctional molecule\nof which provides the covalent binding with the enzyme shell, and its other\npart (pyrene) is adsorbed onto the nanotube surface. First, the usage of such a\nmolecular interface leaves out the direct adsorption of the enzyme (in this\ncase, its activity decreases) onto the nanotube surface, and, second, it\nensures the enzyme localization near the nanotube. The comparison of the\nresonance Raman (RR) spectrum of pristine nanotubes with their spectrum in the\nPSE environment evidences the creation of a nanohybrid formed by an SWNT with a\nPSE molecule which provides the further enzyme immobilization. As the RR\nspectrum of an SWNT:PSE:GOX film does not essentially differ from that of\nSWNT:PSE ones, this indicates that the molecular interface (PSE) isolates the\nenzyme from nanotubes strongly enough. The efficient immobilization of GOX\nalong the carbon nanotubes due to PSE is confirmed with atom-force microscopy\nimages. The method of molecular dynamics allowed us to establish the structures\nof SWNT:PSE:GOX created in the aqueous environment and to determine the\ninteraction energy between hybrid components. In addition, the conductivity of\nthe SWNT network with adsorbed PSE and GOX molecules is studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 11:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-15"}

Six angularly large Virgo cluster spiral galaxies (NGC4192, NGC4302,\nNGC4303, NGC4321, NGC4388, and NGC4535) were targets of a sensitive total power\nand polarization study using the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg at 4.85GHz\nand 8.35GHz (except for NGC4388 observed only at 4.85GHz, and NGC4535 observed\nonly at 8.35GHz).

We study such non-adaptive data structures in the cell probe model.

Unfortunately, this generality comes at a high cost: the\nhighest lower bound proved for any data structure problem is only\npolylogarithmic. Our main result is to demonstrate that one can in fact obtain\npolynomial cell probe lower bounds for non-adaptive data structures.\n  To shed more light on the seemingly inherent polylogarithmic lower bound\nbarrier, we study several different notions of non-adaptivity and identify key\nproperties that must be dealt with if we are to prove polynomial lower bounds\nwithout restrictions on the data structures.\n  Finally, our results also unveil an interesting connection between data\nstructures and depth-2 circuits.

In the second stage, density-functional theory calculations are\nperformed to evaluate free energies of alloys in partially disordered local\nmoment states as a function of lattice constant for various temperatures.\nExtensive tests of the scheme are carried out by comparing simulation results\nfor thermal expansion coefficients of Fe1-xNix with x = 0.35, 0.4, ..., 0.8,\nFe0.72Pt0.28, and Fe0.68Pd0.32 with measurements. The scheme is found to\nperform well, at least qualitatively, throughout the whole spectrum of test\ncompounds. For example, the significant reduction of the thermal expansion\ncoefficient of Fe1-xNix as x decreases from 0.55 to 0.35 near room temperature,\nwhich was discovered by Guillaume, is reliably reproduced.

It is shown here how standard multivariate prediction techniques\ncan be utilized in this context. The connection between functional and\nmultivariate predictions is made precise for the important case of vector and\nfunctional autoregressions. The proposed method is easy to implement, making\nuse of existing statistical software packages, and may therefore be attractive\nto a broader, possibly non-academic, audience.

Consequently the most metal-poor galaxies in the local universe are\ndwarf galaxies. Blue compact dwarfs and tidal dwarfs tend to deviate from the\nmetallicity-luminosity relation by being too metal-poor or too metal-rich for\ntheir luminosity, respectively. A less pronounced offset separates dwarf\nspheroidal (dSph) and dwarf irregular galaxies, making the former too\nmetal-rich for their luminosity, which indicates different formation conditions\nfor these two types of dwarfs. While environment (photo-evaporation through\nlocal re-ionization by massive galaxies, tidal and ram pressure stripping)\ngovern the observed morphology-distance relation, intrinsic properties (in\nparticular total mass) play a decisive role in dwarf galaxy evolution with\nrespect to the time and duration of star formation and the amount of\nenrichment. The metallicity distribution functions of nearby dwarfs can be\nunderstood taking pre-enrichment, gas infall, and winds into account. Many\ndwarfs show evidence for inhomogeneous, localized enrichment. Ultra-faint\ndSphs, which may have formed their metal-poor stars at high redshift via H2\ncooling, show an overabundance of metal-deficient stars as compared to the\n(inner) Galactic halo, but may, along with classical dSphs, have contributed\nsignificantly to the build-up of the outer halo. The abundance ratios measured\nin the irregular Large Magellanic Cloud are consistent with the postulated\nearly accretion of irregulars to form the inner Galactic halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 15:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This converges with other works suggesting that\nthe interior of the Earth could be enriched with hydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 15:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 15:48:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 13:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Both laboratory\nand numerical experiments show that the pit propagation speed and the precise\nshape of the knife edge ridges are universal, independent of initial\nconditions, as has been predicted theoretically. These observations suggest a\nnovel method of fabrication in which a surface is pre-patterned so that it\ndynamically evolves to a desired target pattern made of knife-edge ridges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 22:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

First of all, it is\nemphasized that only the simplest version of the fourth chiral generation,\nnamely, minimal SM4 (mSM4) with only one Higgs doublet is in some tension with\nthe recent LHC data on the Higgs boson search. This tension, which follows from\nthe relative strengths of the H --> 4l and Higgs --> {\\gamma}{\\gamma} channels,\ncan be naturally resolved if there is a mechanism to enhance the\nH-->{\\gamma}{\\gamma} width (although any charged and heavy particle could\nenhance the H-{\\gamma}-{\\gamma} loop, 2HDM can be given as an example).\n  We then emphasize the possible role of the linac-ring type colliders,\nespecially LHeC (QCD Exploder) and TAC super charm factory. The QCD Explorer\nwill give opportunity to enlighten the origin of the 98.5% portion of the\nvisible universe's mass. Especially the {\\gamma}-nucleus option seems to be\nvery promising for QCD studies. The TAC super charm factory may provide\nopportunity to investigate the charm physics with statistics well above that of\nthe dedicated runs at Super-B factories.\n  Finally, it is argued that the history of particle physics (and, more\ngenerally, the history of the investigation of the fundamental ingredients of\nthe matter), a large number of \"fundamental\" particles, an inflation of\nobservable free parameters, and, especially, the mixing of \"fundamental\"\nfermions favor the idea of a new set of fundamental particles at a deeper\nlevel. These new particles can be formulated with the preonic or even\npre-preonic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 20:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-20"}
