Contrarily to standard genetic\noperators, which are uniquely based on the syntax of the individuals, these new\noperators are based on their semantics, meaning with it the set of input-output\npairs on training data. Furthermore, these operators present the interesting\nproperty of inducing a unimodal fitness landscape for every problem that\nconsists in finding a match between given input and output data (for instance\nregression and classification). Nevertheless, the current definition of these\noperators has a serious limitation: they impose an exponential growth in the\nsize of the individuals in the population, so their use is impossible in\npractice. This paper is intended to overcome this limitation, presenting a new\ngenetic programming system that implements geometric semantic operators in an\nextremely efficient way. To demonstrate the power of the proposed system, we\nuse it to solve a complex real-life application in the field of\npharmacokinetic: the prediction of the human oral bioavailability of potential\nnew drugs. Besides the excellent performances on training data, which were\nexpected because the fitness landscape is unimodal, we also report an excellent\ngeneralization ability of the proposed system, at least for the studied\napplication. In fact, it outperforms standard genetic programming and a wide\nset of other well-known machine learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2012 16:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

For such a model, the solutions can\nbe identified numerically and characterized in the perturbative limit of small\ngain/loss. There we find two fundamental phenomena. First, the dark solitons\nthat persist in the presence of the PT-symmetric potential are destabilized via\na symmetry breaking (pitchfork) bifurcation. Second, the ground state and the\ndark soliton die hand-in-hand in a saddle-center bifurcation (a nonlinear\nanalogue of the PT-phase transition) at a second critical value of the\ngain/loss parameter. The daughter states arising from the pitchfork are\nidentified as \"ghost states\", which are not exact solutions of the original\nsystem, yet they play a critical role in the system's dynamics. A similar\nphenomenology is also pairwise identified for higher excited states, with e.g.\nthe two-soliton structure bearing similar characteristics to the zero-soliton\none, and the three-soliton state having the same pitchfork destabilization\nmechanism and saddle-center collision (in this case with the two-soliton) as\nthe one-dark soliton. All of the above notions are generalized in\ntwo-dimensional settings for vortices, where the topological charge enforces\nthe destabilization of a two-vortex state and the collision of a no-vortex\nstate with a two-vortex one, of a one-vortex state with a three-vortex one, and\nso on.

Current commerce\nsearch engines treat terms such as {\\tt designer} as keywords and attempt to\nmatch them to contents such as product reviews and product descriptions, often\nresulting in poor user experience.\n  In this study, we propose to address this problem by reformulating queries\ninvolving terms such as {\\tt designer}, which we call \\emph{modifiers}, to\nqueries that specify precise product attributes. We learn to rewrite the\nmodifiers to attribute values by analyzing user behavior and leveraging\nstructured data sources such as the product catalog that serves the queries. We\nfirst produce a probabilistic mapping between the modifiers and attribute\nvalues based on user behavioral data. These initial associations are then used\nto retrieve products from the catalog, over which we infer sets of attribute\nvalues that best describe the semantics of the modifiers. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of our approach based on a comprehensive Mechanical Turk study.\nWe find that users agree with the attribute values selected by our approach in\nabout 95% of the cases and they prefer the results surfaced for our\nreformulated queries to ones for the original queries in 87% of the time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 01:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

The second\ncase is the quasi-classic turbulence, where vortex lines are believed to form\nthe so called vortex bundles, and their dynamics is described by the HVBK\nequations.

Thus, whether the superconductivity was\ncoexistent with magnetism (underdoped) or not (overdoped) did not affect the\nnon-BCS variation (alpha nearly 2 instead of 0.8-0.9 for BCS superconductors)\nof deltaC/Tc with Tc. The annealed samples in the present work, with increased\ndeltaC/Tc and Tc values compared to previous results for the Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2\nalloy system, suggest that the intrinsic value of the exponent alpha for the\niron superconductors, when the samples are annealed, with fewer defects, may\nindeed be even further from the BCS value of 0.8-0.9 than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 04:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

Compact stars can\nhave such exotic states up to their surface (called strange stars (SS)) or they\ncan have quark core surrounded by hadronic matter, known as hybrid stars (HS).\nAs the state of matter of the resultant SS/HS is different from the initial\nhadronic matter, their masses also differ. Therefore, such conversion leads to\nhuge energy release, sometimes of the order of $10^{53}$ ergs. In the present\nwork we study the qualitative energy released by such conversion. Recent\nobservations reveal huge surface magnetic field in certain stars, termed\nmagnetars. Such huge magnetic fields can modify the equations of state (EOS) of\nthe matter describing the star. Therefore, the mass of magnetars are different\nfrom normal NS. The energy released during the conversion process from neutron\nmagnetar (NM) to strange magnetar/hybrid magnetar (SS/HS) is different from\nnormal NS to SS/HS conversion. In this work we calculate the energy release\nduring the phase transition in magnetars. The energy released during NS to\nSS/HS conversion exceeds the energy released during NM to SM/HM conversion. The\nenergy released during the conversion of NS to SS is always of the order of\n$10^{53}$ ergs. The amount of energy released during such conversion can only\nbe compared to the energy observed during the gamma ray bursts (GRB). The\nenergy liberated during NM to HM conversion is few times lesser, and is not\nlikely to power GRB at cosmological distances. However, the magnetars are more\nlikely to lose their energy from the magnetic poles and can produce giant\nflares, which are usually associated with magnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 05:37:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 11:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-06"}

Jakobi et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 83(2), 022301,\nFeb 2011] proposed a protocol for Oblivious Transfer using well known QKD\ntechniques to establish an Oblivious Key to solve this problem.

Thus, correlation\nbased radar systems require high sampling rates, and with the large amounts of\ndata sampled also necessitate vast memory capacity.

The Aharonov-Bohm is a pure\nquantum mechanical effect which does not have any counterpart in classical\nphysics. In CNTs the Aharonov-Bohm modify the electronic gap and so can be used\nto tune the electronic properties. Though a model able to account for such\nprocess is available in the literature, in the present work we will describe\nthe effect of magnetic fields \"ab-initio\". In the description of CNTs we will\nuse standard approximations which are by far much more accurate and general\nthan any approximation introduced in phenomenological descriptions based on\nmodel systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 09:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

As far as the solutions to the Dirac equation are concerned, it\nis shown that they can be classified into two classes.

On the other hand, the elements of the second\nclass correspond to an infinite number of 4-potentials, and are called\ndegenerate Dirac solutions. Further, it is proven that at least two of these\n4-potentials are gauge-inequivalent, corresponding to different electromagnetic\nfields.

This provides new results that together with\nthe old results give a more detailed picture of the complexity landscape.

We begin by showing that any flexible regular ultrafilter makes the\nproduct of an unbounded sequence of finite cardinals large, {thus} saturating\nany stable theory. We then prove directly that a \"bottleneck\" in the inductive\nconstruction of a regular ultrafilter on $\\lambda$ (i.e. a point after which\nall antichains of $P(\\lambda)/D$ have cardinality less than $\\lambda$)\nessentially prevents any subsequent ultrafilter from being flexible, {thus}\nfrom saturating any non-low theory. The paper's three main constructions are as\nfollows. First, we construct a regular filter $D$ on $\\lambda$ so that any\nultrafilter extending $D$ fails to $\\lambda^+$-saturate ultrapowers of the\nrandom graph, {thus} of any unstable theory. The proof constructs the omitted\nrandom graph type directly. Second, assuming existence of a measurable cardinal\n$\\kappa$, we construct a regular ultrafilter on $\\lambda > \\kappa$ which is\n$\\lambda$-flexible but not $\\kappa^{++}$-good, improving our previous answer to\na question raised in Dow 1975. Third, assuming a weakly compact cardinal\n$\\kappa$, we construct an ultrafilter to show that $\\lcf(\\aleph_0)$ may be\nsmall while all symmetric cuts of cofinality $\\kappa$ are realized.

We show that if a type is dominant (obtains higher payoffs in\ngames with both other types), its 'pure' population state, comprising only\nmembers of that type, is globally attracting. If there is no dominant type,\nthere is an unstable 'mixed' fixed point; the population state eventually\noscillates between the three near-pure states.

Here we show by numerical\nexperiments with the genetic system of one locus/two alleles that considering\nlarge ensembles of populations the Chi-Square test is not decisive and may lead\nto false negatives in random mating populations and false positives in\nnonrandom mating populations. As a result we confirm the logical statement that\nstatistical tests can not be used to deduce if the genetic population is under\nthe HW conditions. Furthermore, we show that under the HW conditions\npopulations of any finite size evolve in time according to what can be\nidentified as neutral dynamics to which the very notion of equilibrium is\nunattainable for any practical purpose. Therefore, under the HW conditions\nequilibrium properties are not observable. We also show that by relaxing the\ncondition of random mating the dynamics acquires all the characteristics of\nasymptotic stable equilibrium. As a consequence our results show that the\nquestion of equilibrium in genetic systems should be approached in close\nanalogy to non-equilibrium statistical physics and its observability should be\nfocused on dynamical quantities like the typical decay properties of the\nallelic auto correlation function in time. In this perspective one should\nabandon the classical notion of genetic equilibrium and its relation to the HW\nproportions and open investigations in the direction of searching for unifying\ngeneral principles of population genetic transformations capable to take in\nconsideration these systems in their full complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 15:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 16:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}
