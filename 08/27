The leading-order dependence of magnetization\nreversal rates are governed by the energy barrier the system needs to surmount\nin order for reversal to proceed. In this paper we study the reversal dynamics\nof these systems and compute the relevant barriers using the string method of\nE, Vanden-Eijnden, and Ren. We find the reversal to be often spatially\nincoherent; that is, rather than the magnetization flipping as a rigid unit,\nreversal proceeds instead through a soliton-like domain wall sweeping through\nthe system. We show that for square nanomagnetic elements the energy barrier\nincreases with element size up to a critical length scale, beyond which the\nenergy barrier is constant. For circular elements the energy barrier continues\nto increase indefinitely, albeit more slowly beyond a critical size. In both\ncases the energy barriers are smaller than those expected for coherent\nmagnetization reversal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 16:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Still, the much\nmore massive and energetic {\\alpha}-particles being studied by Rutherford were\nbetter suited for exploring the interior of the atom, and careful measurements\non the angular dependence of their scattering eventually allowed him to infer\nthe existence of an atomic nucleus. Niels Bohr was particularly troubled by the\nradiative instability inherent to any mechanical atom, and succeeded in 1913\nwhere others had failed in the prediction of emission spectra, by making two\nbold hypotheses that were in contradiction to the laws of classical physics,\nbut necessary in order to account for experimental facts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 23:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2012 02:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-30"}

The origin of coronal type-II radio bursts and of their\nband-splitting are still not fully understood. Aims. To make progress in\nsolving this problem on the basis of one extremely well observed solar eruptive\nevent. Methods. The relative dynamics of multi-thermal eruptive plasmas,\nobserved in detail by the SDO/AIA and of the harmonic type-II burst sources,\nobserved by the NRH at ten frequencies from 445 to 151 MHz, is studied for the\npartially behind the limb event on 3 November 2010. Special attention is given\nto the band-splitting of the burst. Analysis is supplemented by investigation\nof coronal hard X-ray (HXR) sources observed by the RHESSI. Results. It is\nfound that the flare impulsive phase was accompanied by the formation of a\ndouble coronal HXR source, whose upper part coincided with the hot (T~10 MK)\neruptive plasma blob. The leading edge (LE) of the eruptive plasmas (T~1-2 MK)\nmoved upward from the flare region with the speed of v=900-1400 km/s. The type\nII burst source initially appeared just above the LE apex and moved with the\nsame speed and in the same direction. After about 20 s it started to move about\ntwice faster, but still in the same direction. At any given moment the low\nfrequency component (LFC) source of the splitted type-II burst was situated\nabove the high frequency component (HFC) source, which in turn was situated\nabove the LE. It is also found that at a given frequency the HFC source was\nlocated slightly closer to the photosphere than the LFC source. Conclusions.\nThe shock wave, which could be responsible for the observed type-II radio\nburst, was initially driven by the multi-temperature eruptive plasmas, but\nlater transformed to a freely propagating blast shock wave. The most preferable\ninterpretation of the type-II burst splitting is that its LFC was emitted from\nthe upstream region of the shock, whereas the HFC - from the downstream region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 23:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The X-ray heating and radiation pressure on the gas are\nexplicitly calculated using a ray-tracing method. This radiation feedback\ndrives a \"fountain\", that is, a vertical circulation of gas in the central a\nfew to tens parsecs. Interaction between the non-steady outflows and inflows\ncauses the formation of a geometrically thick torus with internal turbulent\nmotion. As a result, the AGN is obscured for a wide range of solid angles. In a\nquasi-steady state, the opening angles for the column density toward a black\nhole < 10^23 cm^-2 are approximately +-30 deg and +-50 deg for AGNs with 10%\nand 1% Eddington luminosity, respectively. Mass inflows through the torus\ncoexist with the outflow and internal turbulent motion, and the average mass\naccretion rate to the central parsec region is 2x10^-4 ~ 10^-3, M_sun/yr this\nis about ten times smaller than accretion rate required to maintain the AGN\nluminosity. This implies that relatively luminous AGN activity is intrinsically\nintermittent or that there are other mechanisms, such as stellar energy\nfeedback, that enhance the mass accretion to the center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 01:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

More precisely, the system\nconverges to the desired fixed point, which is the one corresponding to perfect\ndecoding, if and only if the two EXIT functions describing the components do\nnot cross. For spatially coupled systems whose state is one-dimensional a\nclosely related graphical criterion applies. Now the curves are allowed to\ncross, but not by too much. More precisely, we show that the threshold\nsaturation phenomenon is related to the positivity of the (signed) area\nenclosed by two EXIT-like functions associated to the component systems, a very\nintuitive and easy-to-use graphical characterization.\n  In the spirit of EXIT functions and Gaussian approximations, we also show how\nto apply the technique to higher dimensional and even infinite-dimensional\ncases.

The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism predicts the scaling of\nthe resulting density of defects as a function of the quench rate through a\ncritical point, and this can provide an estimate of the critical exponents of a\nphase transition. In this work we extend our previous study of the\nmiscible-immiscible phase transition of a binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\ncomposed of two hyperfine states in which the spin dynamics are confined to one\ndimension [J. Sabbatini et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 230402 (2011)]. The\ntransition is engineered by controlling a Hamiltonian quench of the coupling\namplitude of the two hyperfine states, and results in the formation of a random\npattern of spatial domains. Using the numerical truncated Wigner phase space\nmethod, we show that in a ring BEC the number of domains formed in the phase\ntransitions scales as predicted by the KZ theory. We also consider the same\nexperiment performed with a harmonically trapped BEC, and investigate how the\ndensity inhomogeneity modifies the dynamics of the phase transition and the KZ\nscaling law for the number of domains. We then make use of the symmetry between\ninhomogeneous phase transitions in anisotropic systems, and an inhomogeneous\nquench in a homogeneous system, to engineer coupling quenches that allow us to\nquantify several aspects of inhomogeneous phase transitions. In particular, we\nquantify the effect of causality in the propagation of the phase transition\nfront on the resulting formation of domain walls, and find indications that the\ndensity of defects is determined during the impulse to adiabatic transition\nafter the crossing of the critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 06:09:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2012 22:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For\ndecades, research in this area has relied upon multimetric indices of various\nforms. Although indices may be numbers, many are constructed based on\nprocedures that are highly qualitative in nature, thus limiting the\nquantitative rigour of the practical interpretations made from these indices.\nThe statistical modelling approach to construct the latent health factor index\n(LHFI) was recently developed to express ecological data, collected to\nconstruct conventional multimetric health indices, in a rigorous quantitative\nmodel that integrates qualitative features of ecosystem health and preconceived\necological relationships among such features. This hierarchical modelling\napproach allows (a) statistical inference of health for observed sites and (b)\nprediction of health for unobserved sites, all accompanied by formal\nuncertainty statements. Thus far, the LHFI approach has been demonstrated and\nvalidated on freshwater ecosystems. The goal of this paper is to adapt this\napproach to modelling estuarine ecosystem health, particularly that of the\npreviously unassessed system in Richibucto in New Brunswick, Canada. Field data\ncorrespond to biotic health metrics that constitute the AZTI marine biotic\nindex (AMBI) and abiotic predictors preconceived to influence biota.

We give a\nlinear stt of which the range is not an s-recognizable tree language. We show\nthat the forward application of simple and linear stt preserves\ns-recognizability. As a corollary, we obtain that the type checking problem of\nsimple and linear stt and the inverse type checking problem of arbitrary stt is\ndecidable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 08:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

Emission is produced by two counter-streaming\nbeams within the outer gaps, at distances above $\\sim$ 20 NS radii. The outward\nmoving beam produces UV-$X$-ray photons via Doppler-booster cyclotron emission,\nand GeV photons by Compton scattering the cyclotron photons produced by the\ninward going beam. The scattering occurs in the deep Klein-Nishina regime,\nwhereby the IC component provides a direct measurement of particle distribution\nwithin the magnetosphere. The required plasma multiplicity is high, $\\sim\n10^6-10^7$, but is consistent with the average particle flux injected into the\npulsar wind nebula.\n  The importance of Compton scattering in the Klein-Nishina regime also implies\nthe importance of pair production in the outer gaps. We suggest that outer gaps\nare important sources of pairs in pulsar magnetospheres.\n  Cyclotron motion of particles in the pulsar magnetosphere may be excited due\nto coherent emission of radio waves by streaming particles at the anomalous\ncyclotron resonance. Thus, a whole range of Crab non-thermal emission, from\ncoherent radio waves to very high energy $\\gamma$-rays - nearly eighteen\ndecades in energy - may be a manifestation of inter-dependent radiation\nprocesses.\n  The present model, together with the observational evidence in favor of the\nIC scattering (Lyutikov et al. 2012; Lyutikov 2012), demonstrates that the\ninverse Compton scattering can be the dominant high energy emission mechanism\nin majority of pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 08:35:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Based on\nconservative assumptions for the performance of the different CTA telescope\nconfigurations, we employ a Monte Carlo based approach to evaluate the\nprospects for detection. First, we discuss CTA prospects for cold dark matter\nsearches, following different observational strategies: in dwarf satellite\ngalaxies of the Milky Way, in the region close to the Galactic Centre, and in\nclusters of galaxies. The possible search for spatial signatures, facilitated\nby the larger field of view of CTA, is also discussed. Next we consider\nsearches for axion-like particles which, besides being possible candidates for\ndark matter may also explain the unexpectedly low absorption by extragalactic\nbackground light of gamma rays from very distant blazars.

The by far experimentally most studied and most prominent\nmagnetization plateau is the 1/8 plateau. Theoretically, one expects that this\nmaterial is well described by the Shastry-Sutherland model. But recent\nmicroscopic calculations indicate that the 1/8 plateau is energetically not\nfavored. Here we report on a very simple microscopic mechanism which naturally\nleads to a 1/8 plateau for realistic values of the magnetic exchange constants.\nWe show that the 1/8 plateau with a diamond unit cell benefits most compared to\nother plateau structures from quantum fluctuations which to a large part are\ninduced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Physically, such couplings\nresult in kinetic terms in an effective hardcore boson description leading to a\nrenormalization of the energy of the different plateaux structures which we\ntreat in this work on the mean-field level. The stability of the resulting\nplateaux are discussed. Furthermore, our results indicate a series of stripe\nstructures above 1/8 and a stable magnetization plateau at 1/6. Most\nqualitative aspects of our microscopic theory agree well with a recently\nformulated phenomenological theory for the experimental data of SrCu_2(BO_3)_2.\nInterestingly, our calculations point to a rather large ratio of the magnetic\ncouplings in the Shastry-Sutherland model such that non-perturbative effects\nbecome essential for the understanding of the frustrated quantum magnet\nSrCu_2(BO_3)_2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 13:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-28"}

We find that the power spectrum of each galaxy can be well\nfitted by a power law $P_{\\rm HI}(U) = A U^{\\alpha}$, with an index $\\alpha$\nthat varies from galaxy to galaxy. For some of the galaxies the scale-invariant\npower-law power spectrum extends to length-scales that are comparable to the\nsize of the galaxy's disk. The distribution of $\\alpha$ is strongly peaked with\n50% of the values in the range $\\alpha=-1.9$ to 1.5, and a mean and standard\ndeviation of -1.3 and 0.5 respectively. We find no significant correlation\nbetween $\\alpha$ and the star formation rate, dynamical mass, \\HI mass or\nvelocity dispersion of the galaxies.\n  Several earlier studies that have measured the power spectrum within our\nGalaxy on length-scales that are considerably smaller than $500 {\\rm pc}$ have\nfound a power-law power spectrum with $\\alpha$ in the range $\\approx -2.8$ to\n-2.5. We propose a picture where we interpret the values in the range $\\approx\n-2.8$ to -2.5 as arising from three dimensional (3D) turbulence in the\nInterstellar Medium (ISM) on length-scales smaller than the galaxy's\nscale-height, and we interpret the values in the range $\\approx -1.9$ to -1.5\nmeasured in this paper as arising from two-dimensional ISM turbulence in the\nplane of the galaxy's disk. It however still remains a difficulty to explain\nthe small galaxy to galaxy variations in the values of $\\alpha$ measured here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 13:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

Affine-invariant codes are simply linear codes whose\ncoordinates are a vector space over a field and which are invariant under\naffine-transformations of the coordinate space. Lifting takes codes defined\nover a vector space of small dimension and lifts them to higher dimensions by\nrequiring their restriction to every subspace of the original dimension to be a\ncodeword of the code being lifted. While the operation is of interest on its\nown, this work focusses on new ranges of parameters that can be obtained by\nsuch codes, in the context of local correction and testing. In particular we\npresent four interesting ranges of parameters that can be achieved by such\nlifts, all of which are new in the context of affine-invariance and some may be\nnew even in general. The main highlight is a construction of high-rate codes\nwith sublinear time decoding. The only prior construction of such codes is due\nto Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin \\cite{KSY}. All our codes are extremely simple,\nbeing just lifts of various parity check codes (codes with one symbol of\nredundancy), and in the final case, the lift of a Reed-Solomon code.\n  We also present a simple connection between certain lifted codes and lower\nbounds on the size of \"Nikodym sets\".

We argue that instead of a well-isolated\nZhang-Rice (ZR) singlet $^1A_{1g}$ the ground state of the hole center\n[CuO$_4$]$^{5-}$ (cluster analog of Cu$^{3+}$ ion) in cuprates should be\ndescribed by a complex $^1A_{1g}$-$^{1,3}B_{2g}$-$^{1,3}E_u$ multiplet, formed\nby a competition of conventional hybrid Cu 3d-O 2p $b_{1g}(\\sigma)\\propto\nd_{x^2 -y^2}$ state and {\\it purely oxygen nonbonding} O 2p$\\pi$ states with\n$a_{2g}(\\pi)$ and $e_{ux,y}(\\pi)$ symmetry.
