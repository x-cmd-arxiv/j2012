Optical spectra and g-band images were observed in 2005 using the\n2.4m telescope at MDM Observatory. Integrated emission-line flux variations\nwere measured for Ha, Hb, Hg, and for HeII4686, as well as g-band fluxes and\nthe optical AGN continuum at 5100A. The g-band fluxes and the AGN continuum\nvary simultaneously within the uncertainties, tau=(0.2+-1.1)days. We find that\nthe emission-line variations are delayed with respect to the variable g-band\ncontinuum by tau(Ha)=56.3(+2.4-6.6)days, tau(Hb)=44.3(+3.0_-3.3)days,\ntau(Hg)=58.1(+4.3-6.1)days, and tau(HeII4686)=22.3(+6.5-3.8)days. The blue and\nred peak in the double peaked line profiles, as well as the blue and red outer\nprofile wings, vary simultaneously within +-3 days. This provides strong\nsupport for gravitationally bound orbital motion of the dominant part of the\nline emitting gas. Combining the time delay of Ha and Hb and the separation of\nthe blue and red peak in the broad double-peaked profiles in their rms spectra,\nwe determine Mbh_vir=1.77(+0.29-0.31)x10^8Msol and using sigma_line of the rms\nspectra Mbh_vir=2.60(+0.23-0.31)x10^8Msol for the central black hole of\n3C390.3, respectively. Using the inclination angle of the line emitting region\nthe mass of the black hole amounts to Mbh=0.86(+0.19-0.18)x10^9 Msol\n(peak-separation) and Mbh=1.26(+0.21-0.16)x10^9 Msol (sigma_line),\nrespectively. This result is consistent with the black hole masses indicated by\nsimple accretion disk models to describe the observed double-peaked profiles,\nderived from the stellar dynamics of 3C390.3, and with the AGN\nradius-luminosity relation. Thus, 3C390.3 as a radio-loud AGN with a low\nEddington ratio, Ledd/Lbol=0.02, follows the same AGN radius-luminosity\nrelation as radio-quiet AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For example, transfers of multiple gigabytes are commonplace, as\nare replicated blocks of such sizes. There is a need for fast error-correction\nor data reconciliation in such settings even when the expected number of errors\nis small.\n  Motivated by such cloud reconciliation problems, we consider error-correction\nschemes designed for large data, after explaining why previous approaches\nappear unsuitable. We introduce Biff codes, which are based on Bloom filters\nand are designed for large data. For Biff codes with a message of length $L$\nand $E$ errors, the encoding time is $O(L)$, decoding time is $O(L + E)$ and\nthe space overhead is $O(E)$. Biff codes are low-density parity-check codes;\nthey are similar to Tornado codes, but are designed for errors instead of\nerasures. Further, Biff codes are designed to be very simple, removing any\nexplicit graph structures and based entirely on hash tables.

In many studies, such complex networks of interactions have been\nderived from empirical time series for various spatially extended systems and\nhave been repeatedly reported to possess the same, possibly desirable,\nproperties (e.g. small-world characteristics and assortativity). In this thesis\nwe study whether and how interaction networks are influenced by the analysis\nmethodology, i.e. by the way how empirical data is acquired (the spatial and\ntemporal sampling of the dynamics) and how nodes and edges are derived from\nmultivariate time series. Our modeling and numerical studies are complemented\nby field data analyses of brain activities that unfold on various spatial and\ntemporal scales. We demonstrate that indications of small-world characteristics\nand assortativity can already be expected due solely to the analysis\nmethodology, irrespective of the actual interaction structure of the system.

This allows us, for the first time, to\ninvestigate the role of X-rays on the wind structure in a bona fide weak-wind\nsystem and to determine whether there actually is a massive, hot wind. The\nX-ray emission measure indicates that the outflow is an order of magnitude\ngreater than that derived from UV lines and is commensurate with the nominal\nwind-luminosity relationship for O-stars. Therefore, the ``weak-wind\nproblem''---identified from cool wind UV/optical spectra---is largely resolved\nby accounting for the hot wind seen in X-rays. From X-ray line profiles,\nDoppler shifts, and relative strengths, we find that this weak-wind star is\ntypical of other late O dwarfs. The X-ray spectra do not suggest a magnetically\nconfined plasma---the spectrum is soft and lines are broadened; Suzaku spectra\nconfirm the lack of emission above 2 keV. Nor do the relative line shifts and\nwidths suggest any wind decoupling by ions. The He-like triplets indicate that\nthe bulk of the X-ray emission is formed rather close to the star, within 5\nstellar radii.

A recent study by us,\nviz., that of Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012; Paper I), which involves realistic\nN-body computations of star clusters mimicking R136, indicates that such\n\"super-canonical\" (SC) stars can be formed out of a dense stellar population\nwith a canonical initial mass function (IMF) through dynamically induced\nmergers of the most massive binaries. Here we study the formation of SC stars\nin the R136 models of Paper I in detail. To avoid forming extraneous SC stars\nfrom initially highly eccentric primordial binaries as in Paper I, we compute\nadditional models with only initially circular primordial binaries. We also\ntake into account the mass-evolution of the SC stars using detailed stellar\nevolutionary models that incorporate updated treatments of stellar winds. We\nfind that SC stars begin to form via dynamical mergers of massive binaries from\napprox. 1 Myr cluster age. We obtain SC stars with initial masses up to approx.\n250 M_sun from these computations. Multiple SC stars are found to remain bound\nto the cluster simultaneously within a SC-lifetime. These properties of the\ndynamically formed SC stars are consistent with those observed in R136. In\nfact, the stellar evolutionary models of SC stars imply that had they formed\nprimordially along with the rest of the R136 cluster, i.e., violating the\ncanonical upper limit, they would have evolved below the canonical 150 M_sun\nlimit by approx. 3 Myr, the likely age of R136, and would not have been\nobservable as SC stars at the present time in R136. This strongly supports the\ndynamical formation scenario of the observed SC stars in R136.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A\nsimilar result is obtained for the integrated likelihood over the set\n{gamma_i}, that can be written as a surface integral of the ratio L/Delta, with\nthe surface in gamma_i space determined by the EW minimum constraints. As a\nresult, a large likelihood actually demands a large ratio L/Delta or\nequivalently, a small chi^2_{new}=chi^2_{old}+2*ln(Delta).

That picture is valid at any value of the 't Hooft coupling. So far\nit has been efficiently used at weak coupling (WC) in cases where only a single\nparticle is flowing. At any finite value of the coupling however, an infinite\nnumber of particles are flowing on top of the color FT. A major open problem in\nthis approach was how to deal with generic multi-particle states at WC. In this\npaper we study the propagation of any number of FT excitations at WC. We do\nthis by first mapping the WL into a sum of two point functions of local\noperators. This map allows us to translate the integrability techniques\ndeveloped for the spectrum problem back to the WL. E.g., the FT Hamiltonian can\nbe represented as a simple kernel acting on the loop. Having an explicit\nrepresentation for the FT Hamiltonian allows us to treat any number of\nparticles on an equal footing. We use it to bootstrap some simple cases where\ntwo particles are flowing, dual to N2MHV amplitudes. The FT is integrable and\ntherefore has other (infinite set of) conserved charges. The generating\nfunction of conserved charges is constructed from the monodromy (M) matrix\nbetween sides of the polygon. We compute it for some simple examples at leading\norder at WC. At strong coupling (SC), these Ms were the main ingredients of the\nY-system solution. To connect the WC and SC computations, we study a case where\nan infinite number of particles are propagating already at leading order at WC.\nWe obtain a precise match between the WC and SC Ms. That match is the WL\nanalogue of the well known Frolov-Tseytlin limit where the WC and SC\ndescriptions become identical. Hopefully, putting the WC and SC descriptions on\nthe same footing is the first step in understanding the all loop structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 20:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In particular, we\nprove results on the statistical properties of a nonparametric estimator that\nwe have designed to have the correct deterministic and stochastic properties\nfor numerical implementation when used in conjunction with LBMPC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 22:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

The mechanical\npart of the momentum is associated with the action of the electromagnetic field\non the atomic constituents of the media, as specified by the Lorentz law of\nforce. Proper interpretation and application of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations\nwithin the material bodies as well as at their surfaces and interfaces is all\nthat is needed to obtain a complete picture of the momentum of light, including\ndetailed numerical values at each and every point in space and time. That the\nAbraham-Minkowski controversy surrounding the momentum of light inside material\nmedia has persisted for nearly a century is due perhaps to an insufficient\nappreciation for the completeness and consistency of the macroscopic\nMaxwell-Lorentz theory, inadequate treatment of the electromagnetic force and\ntorque at the material boundaries, and an undue emphasis on the necessity of\ncoupling the equations of electrodynamics to those of the theory of elasticity\nfor proper treatment of mechanical momentum. The present paper reports the\nresolution of the Abraham-Minkowski controversy within the framework of the\nclassical theory of electrodynamics, without resort to such complicating and\nultimately unnecessary factors as pseudo-momentum, special surface forces,\nalternative energy-momentum tensors, and hidden momenta, that have caused so\nmuch confusion for such a long period of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2012 00:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

Here E is the electric field, H\nthe magnetic field, B the magnetic induction, and mu_0 the permeability of free\nspace. We argue that the identification of one or the other of these Poynting\nvectors with the rate of flow of electromagnetic energy is intimately tied to\nthe nature of magnetic dipoles and the way in which these dipoles exchange\nenergy with the electromagnetic field. In addition, the manifest nature of both\nelectric and magnetic dipoles in their interactions with the electromagnetic\nfield has consequences for the Lorentz law of force. If the conventional\nidentification of magnetic dipoles with Amperian current loops is extended\nbeyond Maxwell's macroscopic equations to the domain where energy, force,\ntorque, momentum, and angular momentum are active participants, it will be\nshown that \"hidden energy\" and \"hidden momentum\" become inescapable\nconsequences of such identification with Amperian current loops. Hidden energy\nand hidden momentum can be avoided, however, if we adopt S=ExH as the true\nPoynting vector, and also accept a generalized version of the Lorentz force\nlaw. We conclude that the identification of magnetic dipoles with Amperian\ncurrent loops, while certainly acceptable within the confines of Maxwell's\nmacroscopic equations, is inadequate and leads to complications when\nconsidering energy, force, torque, momentum, and angular momentum in\nelectromagnetic systems that involve the interaction of fields and matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2012 00:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

The properties as\nwell as the spatial distribution of ULF waves within the Earth's foreshock have\nbeen extensively studied over the last three decades and have been explained as\na result of plasma instabilities triggered by solar wind ions backstreaming\nfrom the bow shock.

We construct a general microscopic network model\nthat incorporates nonlinear elasticity of individual filaments and steric\nconstraints due to crowding. Based on constructive analogies between structural\nglass forming liquids and random field Ising magnets implemented using a\nheterogeneous self-consistent phonon method, our scheme provides a microscopic\napproach to determine the mismatch surface tension and the configurational\nentropy, which compete in determining the barrier for structural rearrangements\nwithin the random first order transition theory of escape from a local energy\nminimum. The influence of crosslinking on the fragility of inorganic network\nglass formers is recapitulated by the model. For active network materials, the\nmapping, which correlates the glassy characteristics to the network\narchitecture and properties of nonequilibrium motor processes, is shown to\ncapture several key experimental observations on the cytoskeleton of living\ncells: Highly connected tense networks behave as strong glass formers; intense\nmotor action promotes reconfiguration. The fact that our model assuming a\nnegative motor susceptibility predicts the latter suggests that on average the\nmotorized processes in living cells do resist the imposed mechanical load.

The basic idea of the new method is solve the problem in three\nsteps: (i) First solve the equation $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf D=\\rho$. The inverse of\nthe divergence operator in a restricted subspace is found to yield the electric\nflux density $\\mathbf D$ by a fast direct solver in O(N) operations. The\n$\\mathbf D$ so obtained is nonunique with indeterminate divergence-free\ncomponent. Then the electric field is found by $\\mathbf E=\\mathbf D/\\epsilon$.\nBut $\\nabla\\times\\mathbf E=0$ for electrostatic field; hence, $\\mathbf E$ is\ncurl free and orthogonal to the divergence free space. (ii) An\northogonalization process is used to purify the electric field making it curl\nfree and unique. (iii) Then the potential $\\phi$ is obtained by solving $\\nabla\n\\phi=-\\mathbf E$ or finding the inverse of the gradient operator in a\nrestricted subspace by a similar fast direct solver in O(N) operations.\nTreatments for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are addressed.\nFinally, the validation and efficiency are illustrated by several numerical\nexamples.

The wavelength coverage was from radio to X-rays. In the\noptical-to-UV range the differential spectrum between the observations has a\nbremsstrahlung spectral shape, consistent with gas at $3 \\times 10^{5}K$\ntemperature. Our result supports the hydrogen column density of the OJ287 host\ngalaxy of $\\sim9.3\\times 10^{20} cm^{-2}$, the average value found by Gosh &\nSoundararajaperumal. The $3 \\times 10^{5}K$ bremsstrahlung radiation was\npredicted in the binary black hole model of OJ287, and it arises from a hot\nbubble of gas which is torn off the accretion disc by the impact of the\nsecondary. As this radiation is not Doppler boosted, the brightness of the\noutburst provides an estimate for the mass of the secondary black hole,\n$\\sim1.4\\times10^{8}$ solar mass. In order to estimate the mass of the primary\nblack hole, we ask what is the minimum mass ratio in a binary system which\nallows the stability of the accretion disc.

This makes the minimum mass of\nthe primary $\\sim1.8\\times10^{10}$ solar mass, in agreement with the mass\ndetermined from the orbit solution, $1.84 \\times 10^{10}$ solar mass. With this\nmass value and the measured K-magnitude of the bulge of the host galaxy of\nOJ287, the system lies almost exactly on the previously established correlation\nin the black hole mass vs. K-magnitude diagramme.

A lot of evidences implying fractal properties such as 1/f power\nspectrums have been also observed in resting state fMRI time series. To explain\nthe fractal behavior in rs-fMRI, we have proposed the fractal-based model of\nresting state hemodynamic response function (rs-HRF) whose properties can be\nsummarized by a fractal exponent. Here we show, through a simulation studies,\nthat the fractal behavior of cerebral hemodynamics may cause significant\ndistortion of network properties between neuronal activities and BOLD signals.\nWe simulated neuronal population activities based on the stochastic neural\nfield model from the Macaque brain network, and then obtained their\ncorresponding BOLD signals by convolving them with the rs-HRF filter. The\nprecision of centrality estimated in each node was deteriorated overall in\nthree networks based on transfer entropy, mutual information, and Pearson\ncorrelation; particularly the distortion of transfer entropy was more sensitive\nto the standard deviation of fractal exponents. A node with high centrality was\nresilient to desynchronized fractal dynamics over all frequencies while a node\nwith small centrality exhibited huge distortion of both wavelet correlation and\ncentrality over low frequencies. This theoretical expectation indicates that\nthe difference of fractal exponents between brain regions leads to discrepancy\nof statistical network properties, especially at nodes with small centrality,\nbetween neuronal activities and BOLD signals, and that the traditional\ndefinitions of resting state functional connectivity may not effectively\nreflect the dynamics of spontaneous neuronal activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2012 13:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

In order to understand the origin of asymmetric YSO jet\nvelocities, we investigate the efficiency of two candidate mechanisms, one\nbased on the intrinsic properties of the system and one based on the role of\nthe external medium.

Eu0.5K0.5Fe2As2 is known\nto exhibit superconductivity with superconducting transition temperature Tc as\nhigh as 33 K.

Based on the exact\nresults of the second order correlation functions, we analyze the quantum\nstatistics behaviors of the out-going photons for two different cases: (a) the\nideal case without the inter-modal coupling in the whispering gallery\nresonator; (b) the case in the presence of the inter-modal coupling which leads\nto more complex nonlinear behavior.

In\nthe presence of intermodal mixing, the system no longer exhibit a free resonant\npathway. Instead, both the single-photon and the two photon transport\nproperties depend on the position of the atom.

During clear nights with a low\nilluminated moon fraction, the UV fluorescence light produced by air showers is\nrecorded by optical telescopes at the Observatory. To correct the observations\nfor variations in atmospheric conditions, atmospheric monitoring is performed\nat regular intervals ranging from several minutes (for cloud identification) to\nseveral hours (for aerosol conditions) to several days (for vertical profiles\nof temperature, pressure, and humidity). In 2009, the monitoring program was\nupgraded to allow for additional targeted measurements of atmospheric\nconditions shortly after the detection of air showers of special interest,\ne.g., showers produced by very high-energy cosmic rays or showers with atypical\nlongitudinal profiles. The former events are of particular importance for the\ndetermination of the energy scale of the Observatory, and the latter are\ncharacteristic of unusual air shower physics or exotic primary particle types.\nThe purpose of targeted (or \"rapid\") monitoring is to improve the resolution of\nthe atmospheric measurements for such events. In this paper, we report on the\nimplementation of the rapid monitoring program and its current status. The\nrapid monitoring data have been analyzed and applied to the reconstruction of\nair showers of high interest, and indicate that the air fluorescence\nmeasurements affected by clouds and aerosols are effectively corrected using\nmeasurements from the regular atmospheric monitoring program. We find that the\nrapid monitoring program has potential for supporting dedicated physics\nanalyses beyond the standard event reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2012 12:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}
