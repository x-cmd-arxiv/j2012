In this framework the W^+ W^- production is expected to be\nsignificant, thus leading to large anti-proton and gamma-ray fluxes.

We\nuse the velocity field maps obtained with SINFONI/VLT on the MASSIV sample,\nselected from the star-forming population in the VVDS. We identify physical\npairs of galaxies from the measurement of the relative velocity and the\nprojected separation (r_p) of the galaxies in the pair. Using the well\nconstrained selection function of the MASSIV sample we derive the gas-rich\nmajor merger fraction (luminosity ratio mu = L_2/L_1 >= 1/4), and, using merger\ntime scales from cosmological simulations, the gas-rich major merger rate at a\nmean redshift up to z = 1.54. We find a high gas-rich major merger fraction of\n20.8+15.2-6.8 %, 20.1+8.0-5.1 % and 22.0+13.7-7.3 % for close pairs with r_p <=\n20h^-1 kpc in redshift ranges z = [0.94, 1.06], [1.2, 1.5) and [1.5, 1.8),\nrespectively. This translates into a gas-rich major merger rate of\n0.116+0.084-0.038 Gyr^-1, 0.147+0.058-0.037 Gyr^-1 and 0.127+0.079-0.042 Gyr^-1\nat z = 1.03, 1.32 and 1.54, respectively. Combining our results with previous\nstudies at z < 1, the gas-rich major merger rate evolves as (1+z)^n, with n =\n3.95 +- 0.12, up to z = 1.5. From these results we infer that ~35% of the\nstar-forming galaxies with stellar masses M = 10^10 - 10^10.5 M_Sun have\nundergone a major merger since z ~ 1.5. We develop a simple model which shows\nthat, assuming that all gas-rich major mergers lead to early-type galaxies, the\ncombined effect of gas-rich and dry mergers is able to explain most of the\nevolution in the number density of massive early-type galaxies since z ~ 1.5,\nwith our measured gas-rich merger rate accounting for about two-thirds of this\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 17:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2013 15:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

In this picture, neutron stars could contain cores made of pure (up,\ndown, strange) quark matter which are surrounded by a mixed phase of quarks and\nhadrons. More than that, because of the competition between the Coulomb and the\nsurface energies associated with the positively charged regions of nuclear\nmatter and negatively charged regions of quark matter, the mixed phase may\ndevelop geometrical structures, similarly to what is expected of the\nsub-nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. In this paper we restrict ourselves to\nconsidering the formation of rare phase blobs in the mixed quark-hadron phase.\nThe influence of rare phase blobs on the thermal and transport properties of\nneutron star matter is investigated. The total specific heat, $c_V$, thermal\nconductivity, $\\kappa$, and electron-blob Bremsstrahlung neutrino emissivities,\n$\\epsilon_{\\nu,\\text{BR}}$, of quark-hybrid matter are computed and the results\nare compared with the associated thermal and transport properties of standard\nneutron star matter. Our results show that the contribution of rare phase blobs\nto the specific heat is negligibly small.

Restoring able-body-like ambulation after SCI may reduce\nthe incidence of these conditions, and increase independence and quality of\nlife. However, no biomedical solution exists that can reverse this lost\nneurological function, and hence novel methods are needed. Brain-computer\ninterface (BCI) controlled lower extremity prosthesis may constitute one such\nnovel approach.\n  One subject with able-body and one with paraplegia due to SCI underwent\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) recording while engaged in alternating epochs of\nidling and walking kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI). These data were analyzed to\ngenerate an EEG prediction model for online BCI operation. A commercial robotic\ngait orthosis (RoGO) system (treadmill suspended), was interfaced with the BCI\ncomputer. In an online test, the subjects were tasked to ambulate using the\nBCI-RoGO system when prompted by computerized cues.

The cloud model is designed to be computationally\nefficient, simple to implement, and applicable for a wide range of atmospheric\nparameters for planets in the habitable zone.\n  We use a 1D, cloud-free, radiative-convective, and photochemical equilibrium\ncode originally developed by Kasting, Pavlov, Segura, and collaborators as\nbasis for our cloudy atmosphere model.

We proceed to\ndescribe the quantization scheme, combining a Fock space quantization for state\nspaces with the Feynman path integral for amplitudes. We show rigorously that\nthe resulting quantum theory satisfies the axioms of the TQFT, in a version\ngeneralized to include fermionic theories. In the bosonic case we show the\nequivalence to a previously developed holomorphic quantization scheme.\nRemarkably, it turns out that consistency in the fermionic case requires state\nspaces to be Krein spaces rather than Hilbert spaces. This is also supported by\narguments from geometric quantization and by the explicit example of the Dirac\nfield theory. Contrary to intuition from the standard formulation of quantum\ntheory, we show that this is compatible with a consistent probability\ninterpretation in the GBF. Another surprise in the fermionic case is the\nemergence of an algebraic notion of time, already in the classical theory, but\ninherited by the quantum theory. As in earlier work we need to impose an\nintegrability condition in the bosonic case for all TQFT axioms to hold, due to\nthe gluing anomaly.

The performance of\nclassical methods for change-point detection typically scales poorly with the\ndimensionality of the data, so that a large number of observations are\ncollected after the true change-point before it can be reliably detected.\nFurthermore, missing components in the observed data handicap conventional\napproaches. The proposed method addresses these challenges by modeling the\ndynamic distribution underlying the data as lying close to a time-varying\nlow-dimensional submanifold embedded within the ambient observation space.\nSpecifically, streaming data is used to track a submanifold approximation,\nmeasure deviations from this approximation, and calculate a series of\nstatistics of the deviations for detecting when the underlying manifold has\nchanged in a sharp or unexpected manner. The approach described in this paper\nleverages several recent results in the field of high-dimensional data\nanalysis, including subspace tracking with missing data, multiscale analysis\ntechniques for point clouds, online optimization, and change-point detection\nperformance analysis.

The single-degenerate scenario is a\nwell-explored model of SNe Ia where unstable thermonuclear burning initiates in\nan accreting, Chandrasekhar-mass WD and forms an advancing flame. By several\nproposed physical processes the rising, burning material triggers a detonation,\nwhich subsequently consumes and unbinds the WD. However, if a detonation is not\ntriggered and the deflagration is too weak to unbind the star, a completely\ndifferent scenario unfolds. We explore the failure of the\nGravitationally-Confined Detonation (GCD) mechanism of SNe Ia, and demonstrate\nthrough 2D and 3D simulations the properties of failed-detonation SNe.

The remaining material is asymmetrically ejected at velocities comparable\nto the escape velocity from the WD, and in response, the WD is kicked to\nvelocities of a few hundred km/s. These kicks may unbind the binary and eject a\nrunaway/hyper-velocity WD. Although the energy and ejected mass of the\nfailed-detonation SN are a fraction of typical thermonuclear SNe, they are\nlikely to appear as sub-luminous low-velocity SNe Ia.

In this\npaper, we are interested in how opinions, about a certain topic, form in social\nnetworks. We model opinions as continuous scalars ranging from 0 to 1 with 1(0)\nrepresenting extremely positive(negative) opinion. Each agent has an initial\nopinion and incurs some cost depending on the opinions of his neighbors, his\ninitial opinion, and his stubbornness about his initial opinion. Agents\niteratively update their opinions based on their own initial opinions and\nobserving the opinions of their neighbors. The iterative update of an agent can\nbe viewed as a myopic cost-minimization response (i.e., the so-called best\nresponse) to the others' actions. We study whether an equilibrium can emerge as\na result of such local interactions and how such equilibrium possibly depends\non the network structure, initial opinions of the agents, and the location of\nstubborn agents and the extent of their stubbornness. We also study the\nconvergence speed to such equilibrium and characterize the convergence time as\na function of aforementioned factors.

We introduce two Monte\nCarlo (MC) simulation approaches for studying such systems, with both\napproaches giving the choice between different calculi (in particular, Ito,\nStratonovich, and \"isothermal\"). To demonstrate these approaches, we study the\ndiffusion on a 1D interval of a particle released at an interface (in the\nmiddle of the system) between two media where this particle has different\ndiffusivities (e.g., two fluids with different viscosities).

We also study the first-passage problem using\nabsorbing boundary conditions. Good agreement is found when comparing the MC\napproaches to theory as well as Brownian and Langevin dynamics simulations.\nAlso, the results themselves turn out to be interesting. For instance: 1) for\nsome calculi, there are more particles on the low-viscosity side (LVS) at\nearlier times and then fewer particles at later times; 2) there is no\npreference to end up on a particular wall for the Ito variant, but a bias\ntowards the wall on the LVS in all other cases; 3) the mean first-passage time\nto the wall on the LVS grows as the viscosity on the other side is increased,\nexcept for the isothermal case where it approaches a constant; 4) when the\nviscosity ratio is high, the first-passage-time distribution for the wall on\nthe LVS is much broader than for the other wall, with a power-law dependence of\nthe former in a certain time interval whose exponent depends on the calculus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 23:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient,\naccurate computation of various other quantities of interest, including the\nnormalizing constant of the stationary distribution and the rate of convergence\nto this distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2012 01:26:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 22:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-06"}

In addition, a much richer spectrum\nof mesons is expected from QCD, in which quarks interact which each other\nthrough the exchange of colored self-interacting gluons.

As a\nconsequence, indirect methods to determine the initial Y among populations are\nnecessary. For that reason, in this series of papers, we investigate the\neffects of a Y enrichment in populations covering the range of GC\nmetallicities. In this first paper, we present the theoretical evolutionary\ntracks, isochrones, and ZAHB loci calculated with the Princeton-Goddard-PUC\n(PGPUC) stellar evolutionary code, which has been updated with the most recent\ninput physics and compared with other theoretical databases. The chemical\ncomposition grid covers 9 Z ranging from Z=1.60x10^-4 to 1.57x10^-2, 7 Y from\nY=0.230 to 0.370, and an alpha-element enhancement of [alpha/Fe]=0.3. The\neffects of different helium abundances that can be observed in isochrones are:\nsplits in the MS, differences in the L and Teff of the turn off point, splits\nin the SGB being more prominent for lower ages or higher metallicities, splits\nin the lower red giant branch being more prominent for higher ages or higher\nmetallicities, differences in L of the RGB bump (with small changes in Teff),\nand differences in L at the RGB tip. At the ZAHB, when Y is increased there is\nan increase of L for low Teff, which is affected in different degrees depending\non the age of the GC being studied. Finally, the ZAHB morphology distribution\ndepending on the age explains how for higher GC metallicities a population with\nhigher helium abundance could be hidden at the red ZAHB locus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2012 11:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

While point\ndefects in the bulk are confined in pairs connected by energetic strings, the\nsurface excitations are more interesting: the model has deconfined point\ndefects pinned to the boundary of the lattice, and these exhibit semionic\nbraiding statistics. The surface physics is reminiscent of a $\\nu=1/2$ bosonic\nfractional quantum Hall effect in its topological limit, and these\nconsiderations help motivate an effective field theoretic description for the\nlattice models as variants of $bF$ theories. Our special example of the 3D\nsemion model captures much of the behavior of more general `confined\nWalker-Wang models'. We contrast the 3D semion model with the closely related\n3D version of the toric code (a lattice gauge theory) which has deconfined\npoint excitations in the bulk and we discuss how more general models may have\nsome confined and some deconfined excitations. Having seen that there exist\nlattice models whose surfaces have the same topological order as a bosonic\nfractional quantum Hall effect on a confining bulk, we construct a lattice\nmodel whose surface has similar topological order to a fermionic quantum hall\neffect. We find that in these models a fermion is always deconfined in the\nthree dimensional bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2012 11:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

We find that while this is possible in\nthe one-particle sector, the magnon-mediated interactions which are key to\nproperly describe the two-carrier states of the complex model are not\nreproduced by the simpler models. We argue that this is true not just for\nferromagnetic, but also for antiferromagnetic backgrounds. Our results question\nthe ability of simple one-band models to accurately describe the low-energy\nphysics of cuprate layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2012 15:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The energy density and pressure for non-linear\nelectrodynamics have been written in the electro-magnetic universe. The\nEinstein's field equations for flat FRW model in loop quantum cosmology have\nbeen considered if the universe is filled with the matter and electro-magnetic\nfield. We separately assumed the magnetic universe and electric universe. The\ninteraction between matter and magnetic field have been considered in one\nsection and for some particular form of interaction term, we have found the\nsolutions of magnetic field and the energy density of matter. We have also\nconsidered the interaction between the matter and electric field and another\nform of interaction term has been chosen to solve the field equations. The\nvalidity of generalized second law of thermodynamics has been investigated on\napparent and event horizons using Gibb's law and the first law of\nthermodynamics for magnetic and electric universe separately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2012 04:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-29"}
