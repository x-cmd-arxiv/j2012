We use the\nintegrability of the AdS string equations to compute the AdS part for operators\nof arbitrary conformal dimensions.

Results. The circumstellar environment of HD 142527 is revealed at an\nunprecedented spatial resolution down to the sub arcsecond level for the first\ntime at 3.8 microns. Our images reveal important radial and azimuthal\nasymmetries which invalidate an elliptical shape for the disk as previously\nproposed.

From this dataset, we form a series of\n52 spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning nearly two months that are\nunprecedented in time coverage and breadth of frequency. Discrete correlation\nanlaysis of the millimeter, far-infrared, and gamma-ray light curves show that\nthe variations were essentially simultaneous, indicative of co-spatiality of\nthe emission, at these wavebands. In contrast, differences in short-term\nfluctuations at various wavelengths imply the presence of inhomegeneities in\nphysical conditions across the source. We locate the site of the outburst in\nthe parsec-scale core, whose flux density as measured on 7 mm Very Long\nBaseline Array images increased by 70 percent during the first five weeks of\nthe outburst. Based on these considerations and guided by the SEDs, we propose\na model in which turbulent plasma crosses a conical standing shock in the\nparsec-scale region of the jet. Here, the high-energy emission in the model is\nproduced by inverse Compton scattering of seed photons supplied by either\nnonthermal radiation from a Mach disk, thermal emission from hot dust, or (for\nX-rays) synchrotron radiation from plasma that crosses the standing shock. For\nthe two dates on which we fitted the model SED to the data, the model\ncorresponds very well to the observations at all bands except at X-ray\nenergies, where the spectrum is flatter than observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 17:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The definition of restricted sensitivity is similar to that of global\nsensitivity except that instead of quantifying over all possible datasets, we\ntake advantage of any beliefs about the dataset that a querier may have, to\nquantify over a restricted class of datasets. Specifically, given a query f and\na hypothesis H about the structure of a dataset D, we show generically how to\ntransform f into a new query f_H whose global sensitivity (over all datasets\nincluding those that do not satisfy H) matches the restricted sensitivity of\nthe query f. Moreover, if the belief of the querier is correct (i.e., D is in\nH) then f_H(D) = f(D).

In particular, while our generic\nprocedure is computationally inefficient, for the specific definition of H as\ngraphs of bounded degree, we exhibit efficient ways of constructing f_H using\ndifferent projection-based techniques. We then analyze two important query\nclasses: subgraph counting queries (e.g., number of triangles) and local\nprofile queries (e.g., number of people who know a spy and a computer-scientist\nwho know each other). We demonstrate that the restricted sensitivity of such\nqueries can be significantly lower than their smooth sensitivity. Thus, using\nrestricted sensitivity we can maintain privacy whether or not D is in H, while\nproviding more accurate results in the event that H holds true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 19:31:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2013 20:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-04"}

While the H2 abundance is\nultimately regulated by physical processes operating on small scales in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), observations have revealed a tight correlation\nbetween the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen in nearby spiral galaxies and\nthe pressure in the mid-plane of their disks. This empirical relation has been\nused to predict H2 abundances in galaxies with potentially very different ISM\nconditions, such as metal-deficient galaxies at high redshifts. Here, we test\nthe validity of this approach by studying the dependence of the pressure -- H2\nrelation on environmental parameters of the ISM. To this end, we follow the\nformation and destruction of H2 explicitly in a suite of hydrodynamical\nsimulations of galaxies with different ISM parameters. We find that a pressure\n-- H2 relation arises naturally in our simulations for a variety of dust-to-gas\nratios or strengths of the interstellar radiation field in the ISM. Fixing the\ndust-to-gas ratio and the UV radiation field to values measured in the solar\nneighborhood results in fair agreement with the relation observed in nearby\ngalaxies with roughly solar metallicity. However, the parameters (slope and\nnormalization) of the pressure -- H2 relation vary in a systematical way with\nISM properties. A particularly strong trend is the decrease of the\nnormalization of the relation with a lowering of the dust-to-gas ratio of the\nISM. We show that this trend and other properties of the pressure -- H2\nrelation are natural consequences of the transition from atomic to molecular\nhydrogen with gas surface density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In order to compare the model to observations, we use the GLIMPSE,\nMIPSGAL, and IRAS surveys to construct total emission spectra, as well as\nlongitude and latitude profiles for the emission. The distribution of stars and\ndust is taken from the SKY model, and the dust emissivities includes an\napproximation of the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in addition\nto thermal emission. The model emission is in broad agreement with the\nobservations, but a few modifications are needed to obtain a good fit. Firstly,\nby adjusting the model to include two major and two minor spiral arms rather\nthan four equal spiral arms, the fit to the longitude profiles for |l|>30\ndegrees can be improved. Secondly, introducing a deficit in the dust\ndistribution in the inner Galaxy results in a better fit to the shape of the\nIRAS longitude profiles at 60 and 100 microns. With these modifications, the\nmodel fits the observed profiles well, although it systematically\nunder-estimates the 5.8 and 8.0 microns fluxes. One way to resolve this\ndiscrepancy is to increase the abundance of PAH molecules by 50% compared to\nthe original model, although we note that changes to the dust distribution or\nradiation field may provide alternative solutions. Finally, we use the model to\nquantify which stellar populations contribute the most to the heating of\ndifferent dust types, and which stellar populations and dust types contribute\nthe most to the emission at different wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 16:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-19"}

A key feature is that the screening mechanism\nsuppressing its effects in high-density environments is determined by the local\nscalar field value. Under very general conditions, we prove two theorems\nlimiting its cosmological impact: i) the Compton wavelength of such a scalar\ncan be at most Mpc at present cosmic density, which restricts its impact to\nnon-linear scales; ii) the conformal factor relating Einstein- and Jordan-frame\nscale factors is essentially constant over the last Hubble time, which\nprecludes the possibility of self-acceleration. These results imply that\nchameleon-like scalar fields have a negligible effect on the linear-scale\ngrowth history; theories that invoke a chameleon-like scalar to explain cosmic\nacceleration rely on a form of dark energy rather than a genuine modified\ngravity effect.

We deduce that the evolution of the impact flux did not\ndecline exponentially over the first billion years of lunar history, but also\nthere was no prominent and \"narrow\" impact spike some 3.9 Gy ago, unlike that\ntypically envisioned in the lunar cataclysm scenario. Instead, we show the\ntimeline of the lunar bombardment has a sawtooth-like profile, with an uptick\nin the impact flux near 4.1 Gy ago. The impact flux at the beginning of this\nweaker cataclysm was 5-10 times higher than the immediately preceding period.\nThe Nectaris basin should have been one of the first basins formed at the\nsawtooth. We predict the bombardment rate since about 4.1Gy ago declined slowly\nand adhered relatively close to classic crater chronology models (Neukum and\nIvanov (1994)). Overall we expect that the sawtooth event accounted for about\n1/4 of the total bombardment suffered by the Moon since its formation.\nConsequently, considering that about 12-14 basins formed during the sawtooth\nevent, we expect that the net number of basins formed on the Moon was about\n45-50. From our expected bombardment timeline, we derived a new and improved\nlunar chronology suitable for use on Pre-Nectarian surface units. According to\nthis chronology, a significant portion of the oldest lunar cratered terrains\nhas an age of 4.38-4.42 Gyr. Moreover, the largest lunar basin, South Pole\nAitken, is older than 4.3Gy, and therefore was not produced during the lunar\ncataclysm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 21:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

However, the nature of this mechanism is poorly\nunderstood, let alone quantified. To address this problem, we conduct\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations of a local shearing sheet of a thin,\nthermally unstable, gaseous disk driven by a background stellar spiral\npotential, including metals modeled as passive scalar fields. Contrary to what\na simple \\alpha\\ prescription for the gas disk would suggest, we find that\nturbulence driven by thermal instability is very efficient at mixing metals,\nregardless of the presence or absence of stellar spiral potentials or magnetic\nfields. The timescale for homogenizing randomly distributed metals is\ncomparable to or less than the local orbital time in the disk. This implies\nthat turbulent mixing of metals is a significant process in the history of\nchemical evolution of disk galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 21:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

From the UV wind line\nvariability the B1/B2V star sigma Lupi emerged as a new magnetic candidate\nstar. AAT spectropolarimetric measurements with SEMPOL were obtained. The\nlongitudinal component of the magnetic field integrated over the visible\nsurface of the star was determined with the Least-Squares Deconvolution method.\nThe UV line variations of sigma Lupi are similar to what is known in magnetic B\nstars, but no periodicity could be determined. We detected a varying\nlongitudinal magnetic field with amplitude of about 100 G with error bars of\ntypically 20 G, which supports an oblique magnetic-rotator configuration.

Using these observations combined with archival\nSpitzer Space Telescope data, we have determined the spectral classifications,\nextinction, distances, and spectral energy distributions for the brightest\nmembers of the cluster. Of the eight objects observed, we identify four main\nsequence (MS) OB stars, two Herbig Ae/Be stars, and two low-mass young stellar\nobjects. Strong HeI absorption at 1.083 micron in the MS star spectra strongly\nsuggests that at least some of these sources are in fact close binaries. Two\nout of the four MS stars also show significant infrared excesses typical of\ncircumstellar disks. Extinctions and distances were determined for each MS star\nby fitting model stellar atmospheres to the SEDs. We estimate a distance to the\ncluster of between 455 and 535 pc, which agrees well with earlier (but far less\nprecise) distance estimates.

A much weaker but even warmer (~ 700 K)\ncomponent, which is highly redshifted (+100 km s-1), is also detected, in\naddition to a cold (~ 20 K) component centered at the systemic velocity of the\ngalaxy. On the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, the column\ndensity of CO in the 270 K component is NCO ~ 4.5 x 10^18 cm-2, which in fully\nmolecular gas corresponds to a H2 column density of NH2 ~ 2.5 x 10^22 cm-2.

In most areas in the corona magnetic forces are so dominant that all\nnon-magnetic forces like plasma pressure gradient and gravity can be neglected\nin the lowest order. This model assumption is called the force-free field\nassumption, as the Lorentz force vanishes. This can be obtained by either\nvanishing electric currents (leading to potential fields) or the currents are\nco-aligned with the magnetic field lines. First we discuss a mathematically\nsimpler approach that the magnetic field and currents are proportional with one\nglobal constant, the so-called linear force-free field approximation. In the\ngeneric case, however, the relation between magnetic fields and electric\ncurrents is nonlinear and analytic solutions have been only found for special\ncases, like 1D or 2D configurations. For constructing realistic nonlinear\nforce-free coronal magnetic field models in 3D, sophisticated numerical\ncomputations are required and boundary conditions must be obtained from\nmeasurements of the magnetic field vector in the solar photosphere. This\napproach is currently of large interests, as accurate measurements of the\nphotospheric field become available from ground-based (for example SOLIS) and\nspace-born (for example Hinode and SDO) instruments. If we can obtain accurate\nforce-free coronal magnetic field models we can calculate the free magnetic\nenergy in the corona, a quantity which is important for the prediction of\nflares and coronal mass ejections.

On the normal branch, the Sco-like and\nCyg-like sources are similar, the results indicating an increase of mass\naccretion rate Mdot between soft and hard apex, not as in the standard view\nthat this increases around the Z. In the Cyg-like sources, increasing Mdot\ncauses the neutron star temperature kT to increase from ~1 to ~2 keV.

In the Sco-like sources,\nthe main physical difference is the high kT of more than 2 keV on all parts of\nthe Z-track suggesting that jets are always possible, even on the flaring\nbranch. The flaring branch in the Cyg-like sources is associated with release\nof energy on the neutron star consistent with unstable nuclear burning. The\nSco-like sources are very different as flaring appears to be a combination of\nunstable burning and an increase of Mdot which makes flaring much stronger.\nAnalysis of 15 years or RXTE ASM data on all 6 classic Z-track sources shows\nthe high rate and strength of flaring in the Sco-like sources suggesting that\ncontinual release of energy heats the neutron star causing the high kT.

It starts by suggesting that, to emphasize common properties in relation\nto CFE theory, the term 'Lauritsen plot' could be used to describe all\ngraphical plots made with the reciprocal of barrier field (or the reciprocal of\na quantity proportional to barrier field) on the horizontal axis. It then\nargues that Lauritsen plots related to barrier strength (G) and transmission\nprobability (D) could play a useful role in discussion of CFE theory. Such\nplots would supplement conventional Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots. All these plots\nwould be regarded as particular types of Lauritsen plot. The Lauritsen plots of\n-G and lnD can be used to illustrate how basic aspects of FN tunnelling theory\nare influenced by the mathematical form of the tunnelling barrier. These, in\nturn, influence local emission current density and emission current.\nIllustrative applications used in this note relate to the well-known exact\ntriangular and Schottky-Nordheim barriers, and to the Coulomb barrier (i.e.,\nthe electrostatic component of the electron potential energy barrier outside a\nmodel spherical emitter). For the Coulomb barrier, a good analytical series\napproximation has been found for the barrier-form correction factor; this can\nbe used to predict the existence (and to some extent the properties) of related\ncurvature in FN plots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 12:11:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2012 19:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2012 20:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

However, a fleet of EVs\nwith different EV battery charging rate constraints, that is distributed across\na smart power grid network requires a coordinated charging schedule to minimize\nthe power generation and EV charging costs. In this paper, we study a joint\noptimal power flow (OPF) and EV charging problem that augments the OPF problem\nwith charging EVs over time. While the OPF problem is generally nonconvex and\nnonsmooth, it is shown recently that the OPF problem can be solved optimally\nfor most practical power networks using its convex dual problem. Building on\nthis zero duality gap result, we study a nested optimization approach to\ndecompose the joint OPF and EV charging problem. We characterize the optimal\noffline EV charging schedule to be a valley-filling profile, which allows us to\ndevelop an optimal offline algorithm with computational complexity that is\nsignificantly lower than centralized interior point solvers. Furthermore, we\npropose a decentralized online algorithm that dynamically tracks the\nvalley-filling profile.

In addition, annealing at 563\nK, well above Tp, suppresses the superconducting transition temperature Tc and\nleads to an increase of the antiferromagnetic susceptibility accompanied by the\ncreation of ferromagnetic impurity phases, which are developing with annealing\ntime. However, annealing at T=488K=Tp increases Tc up to 33.3 K, sharpens the\nsuperconducting transition, increases the lower critical field, and strengthens\nthe screening efficiency of the applied magnetic field.

To make DPS approaches work well, one crucial issue\nis to select an appropriate space of parameterized policies with respect to the\ntargeted problem. A fundamental issue in LT approaches is that, to take good\ndecisions, such policies must develop very large look-ahead trees which may\nrequire excessive online computational resources. In this paper, we propose a\nnew hybrid policy learning scheme that lies at the intersection of DPS and LT,\nin which the policy is an algorithm that develops a small look-ahead tree in a\ndirected way, guided by a node scoring function that is learned through DPS.\nThe LT-based representation is shown to be a versatile way of representing\npolicies in a DPS scheme, while at the same time, DPS enables to significantly\nreduce the size of the look-ahead trees that are required to take high-quality\ndecisions.\n  We experimentally compare our method with two other state-of-the-art DPS\ntechniques and four common LT policies on four benchmark domains and show that\nit combines the advantages of the two techniques from which it originates. In\nparticular, we show that our method: (1) produces overall better performing\npolicies than both pure DPS and pure LT policies, (2) requires a substantially\nsmaller number of policy evaluations than other DPS techniques, (3) is easy to\ntune and (4) results in policies that are quite robust with respect to\nperturbations of the initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 14:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) physics on Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiation transfer and\nto quantify how galaxy orientation with respect to the line of sight alters\nobservational signatures. Methods. We compare the results of Lya radiation\ntransfer calculations through the ISM of a couple of idealized galaxy\nsimulations with different ISM models. Results. First, the small-scale\nstructuration of the ISM plays a determinant role in shaping a galaxys Lya\nproperties.The artificially warm, and hence smooth, ISM of G1 yields an escape\nfraction of 50 percent at the Lya line center, and produces symmetrical\ndouble-peak profiles. On the contrary, in G2, most young stars are embedded in\nthick star-forming clouds, and the result is a 10 times lower escape fraction.\nG2 also displays a stronger outflowing velocity field, which favors the escape\nof red-shifted photons, resulting in an asymmetric Lya line. Second, the Lya\nproperties of G2 strongly depend on the inclination at which it is observed:\nFrom edge-on to face-on, the line goes from a double-peak profile with an\nequivalent width of -5 Angstrom to a 15 times more luminous red-shifted\nasymmetric line with EW 90 Angstrom. Conclusions. Lya radiation transfer\ncalculations can only lead to realistic properties in simulations where\ngalaxies are resolved into giant molecular clouds, putting these calculations\nout of reach of current large scale cosmological simulations. Finally, we find\ninclination effects to be much stronger for Lya photons than for continuum\nradiation. This could potentially introduce severe biases in the selection\nfunction of narrow-band Lya emitter surveys, which could indeed miss a\nsignificant fraction of the high-z galaxy population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 15:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
