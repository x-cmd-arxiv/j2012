The very high spatial resolution of the data\n(diffraction limit of 77 km and pixel scale of 0.$\"$0375) augmented by the very\nhigh image contrast (15.5$\\pm$0.6%) allowed us to detect for the first time a\ndistinct subpopulation of mini-granular structures.

The regular granules display a Gaussian (normal) size\ndistribution with a mean diameter of 1050 km. Mini-granular structures\ncontribute significantly to the total granular area. They are predominantly\nconfined to the wide dark lanes between regular granules and often form chains\nand clusters, but different from magnetic bright points.

The line\nemission from several molecules in the coma was measured with high\nsignal-to-noise ratio in January 2005 at heliocentric distance of 1.2 AU by\nmeans of high-resolution spectroscopic observations using the Submillimeter\nTelescope (SMT). We have obtained production rates of several volatiles (CH3OH,\nHCN, H13CN, HNC, H2CO, CO and CS) by comparing the observed and simulated\nline-integrated intensities. Furthermore, multiline observations of the CH3OH\n(7-6) series allow us to estimate the rotational temperature using the rotation\ndiagram technique. We find that the CH3OH population distribution of the levels\nsampled by these lines can be described by a rotational temperature of 40 \\pm 3\nK. Derived mixing ratios relative to hydrogen cyanide are\nCO/CH3OH/H2CO/CS/HNC/H13CN/HCN = 30.9/24.6/4.8/0.57/0.031/0.013/1 assuming a\npointing offset of 8\" due to the uncertain ephemeris at the time of the\nobservations and the telescope pointing error. The measured relative molecular\nabundances in C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) are between low- to typical values of those\nobtained in Oort Cloud comets, suggesting that it has visited the inner solar\nsystem previously and undergone thermal processing. The HNC/HCN abundance ratio\nof ~3.1% is comparable to that found in other comets, accounting for the\ndependence on the heliocentric distance, and could possibly be explained by\nion-molecule chemical processes in the low-temperature atmosphere. From a\ntentative H13CN detection, the measured value of 97 \\pm 30 for the H12CN/H13CN\nisotopologue pair is consistent with a telluric value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}

Our approach relies on two basic assumptions: 1) galaxies'\naverage paths through time in stellar mass vs. star formation rate space are\nrepresented by a family of smooth functions that are determined by the\ngalaxies' final stellar mass, and 2) galaxies grow and become enriched with\nheavy elements such that they always evolve along the mass--metallicity--star\nformation rate relation.

However, this result depends\non the ability to accurately measure the masses of evolved stars. Recently,\nLloyd (2011) called into question the masses of subgiant stars targeted by\nDoppler surveys. Lloyd argues that very few observable subgiants have masses\ngreater than 1.5 Msun, and that most of them have masses in the range 1.0-1.2\nMsun. To investigate this claim, we use Galactic stellar population models to\ngenerate an all-sky distribution of stars. We incorporate the effects that make\nmassive subgiants less numerous, such as the initial mass function and\ndifferences in stellar evolution timescales. We find that these effects lead to\nnegligibly small systematic errors in stellar mass estimates, in contrast to\nthe roughly 50% errors predicted by Lloyd. Additionally, our simulated target\nsample does in fact include a significant fraction of stars with masses greater\nthan 1.5 Msun, primarily because the inclusion of an apparent magnitude limit\nresults in a Malmquist-like bias toward more massive stars, in contrast to the\nvolume-limited simulations of Lloyd. The magnitude limit shifts the mean of our\nsimulated distribution toward higher masses and results in a relatively smaller\nnumber of evolved stars with masses in the range 1.0-1.2 Msun. We conclude\nthat, within the context of our present-day understanding of stellar structure\nand evolution, many of the subgiants observed in Doppler surveys are indeed as\nmassive as main-sequence A stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 20:28:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 00:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2013 19:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We studied the influences of the degree of annealing on\nthe optical properties of the dots from the peak shifts of the superlattice,\nwhich has the same composition as the dots, since the superlattice has uniform\nand well-defined geometry. Theoretical analysis provided the diffusion length\ndependence of the peak shifts of the emission spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 01:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-15"}

As a consequence, such\ntime-semidiscretizations conserve the modified Hamiltonian up to an\nexponentially small error. The modified Hamiltonian is $O(h^p)$-close to the\noriginal energy where $p$ is the order of the method and $h$ the time\nstep-size. Examples of such systems are the semilinear wave equation or the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with analytic nonlinearity and periodic\nboundary conditions. Standard Hamiltonian interpolation results do not apply\nhere because of the occurrence of unbounded operators in the construction of\nthe modified vector field.

Recently, Compressed Sampling\n(CS) techniques, which exploit the sparsity of signals, have allowed to\nreconstruct signal and images with less measurements than the traditional\nNyquist sensing approach. However, multichannel signals like Hyperspectral\nimages (HSI) have additional structures, like inter-channel correlations, that\nare not taken into account in the classical CS scheme. In this paper we exploit\nthe linear mixture of sources model, that is the assumption that the\nmultichannel signal is composed of a linear combination of sources, each of\nthem having its own spectral signature, and propose new sampling schemes\nexploiting this model to considerably decrease the number of measurements\nneeded for the acquisition and source separation. Moreover, we give theoretical\nlower bounds on the number of measurements required to perform reconstruction\nof both the multichannel signal and its sources. We also proposed optimization\nalgorithms and extensive experimentation on our target application which is\nHSI, and show that our approach recovers HSI with far less measurements and\ncomputational effort than traditional CS approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 14:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Given a rectangle Q = [\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2]\nx [\\beta_1, \\beta_2], a range skyline query returns the maxima of the points in\nP \\cap Q. An important variant is the so-called top-open queries, where Q is a\n3-sided rectangle whose upper edge is grounded at y = \\infty (that is, \\beta_2\n= \\infty). These queries are crucial in numerous database applications. In\ninternal memory, extensive research has been devoted to designing data\nstructures that can answer such queries efficiently. In contrast, currently\nthere is no clear understanding about their exact complexities in external\nmemory.\n  This paper presents several structures of linear size for answering the above\nqueries with the optimal I/O cost. We show that a top-open query can be solved\nin O(log_B(n) + k/B) I/Os, where B is the block size and k is the number of\npoints in the query result. The query cost can be made O(log log_B(U) + k/B)\nwhen the data points lie in a U x U grid for some integer U >= n, and further\nlowered to O(1 + k/B) if U = O(n). The same efficiency also applies to 3-sided\nqueries where Q is a right-open rectangle. However, the hardness of the problem\nincreases if Q is a left- or bottom-open 3-sided rectangle. We prove that any\nlinear-size structure must perform \\Omega((n/B)^\\eps + k/B) I/Os to solve such\na query in the worst case, where \\eps > 0 can be an arbitrarily small constant.\nIn fact, left- and right-open queries are just as difficult as general\n(4-sided) queries, for which we give a linear-size structure with query time\nO((n/B)^\\eps + k/B). Interestingly, this indicates that 4-sided range skyline\nqueries have exactly the same hardness as 4-sided range reporting (where the\ngoal is to report simply the whole P \\cap Q).

This symmetry underlies\nthe conservation of optical helicity, and, as we show here, is closely related\nto the separation of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of light (the helicity\nflux coincides with the spin angular momentum). However, in the standard\nfield-theory formulation of electromagnetism, the field Lagrangian is not dual\nsymmetric. This leads to problematic dual-asymmetric forms of the canonical\nenergy-momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum tensors. Moreover, we show\nthat the components of these tensors conflict with the helicity and energy\nconservation laws. To resolve this discrepancy between the symmetries of the\nLagrangian and Maxwell equations, we put forward a dual-symmetric Lagrangian\nformulation of classical electromagnetism. This dual electromagnetism preserves\nthe form of Maxwell equations, yields meaningful canonical energy-momentum and\nangular momentum tensors, and ensures a self-consistent separation of the spin\nand orbital degrees of freedom. This provides rigorous derivation of results\nsuggested in other recent approaches. We make the Noether analysis of the dual\nsymmetry and all the Poincar\\'e symmetries, examine both local and integral\nconserved quantities, and show that only the dual electromagnetism naturally\nproduces a complete self-consistent set of conservation laws.

Using three-dimensional turbulence\nsimulations, we show that the energy of the resulting mean magnetic field of\nthe saturated state increases linearly with the product of normalized helicity\nand the ratio of domain scale to eddy scale, provided this product exceeds a\ncritical value of around unity. This implies that large-scale dynamo action\ncommences when the normalized helicity is larger than the inverse scale ratio.\nOur results show that the emergence of small-scale dynamo action does not have\nany noticeable effect on the large-scale dynamo.

The plausible physical\nphenomena leading to these observations are discussed in terms of the homopolar\nand heteropolar bond dynamics under high energy absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 15:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2013 20:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}

With $f(R)$ modified gravity, one does not need to introduce extra\nscalar, the nature of which are to be explained. Different from general\nnonminimal coupling theory, the behavior of the $f(R)$ theory has been fixed by\nits counterpart in Einstein frame, and thus have one to one correspondence.\nNumerical plots of the functional form of $f(R)$ as well as the evolution of\n$R$ in terms of cosmic time $t$ are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 03:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2012 02:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Concerning the title's subject, a perfect theory would require\nthat the true vacuum expectation value of the operator associated with pair\nproduction, be compatible with the normalization of the true vacuum. At\npresent, a calculation of the vacuum energy based on Feynman diagrams reveals a\nserious difficulty: if only second order terms of the S-matrix are retained,\nand because there are no external lines, it follows that the space-time\nintegrations over the coordinates, involved in the calculation of the vacuum\nexpectation value of the S-matrix, give rise to two identical delta functions:\nthe amplitude is thus proportional to the space-time volume of integration, L4.\nThe square of the amplitude defies then any physically meaningful\ninterpretation. One is faced here with two evils: modify the interaction\nLagrangian so that the amplitude becomes proportional to L2, or abstain from\nany calculation. It is felt that the first one is the lesser evil. If the\nsquare of the amplitude is proportional to L4 (instead of L8), it, can be\ninterpreted as being the number, N, of events (pairs created), in the volume of\nintegration. In the calculations for N it was assumed that the integral over\nmomentums (rescaled to be dimensionless) was of the order unity, and that\nprocesses with small virtual photon-energy are predominant. The pairs'\ncontribution to the vacuum density is then given by the mass of the particles\nmultiplied, by the number of events per unit volume and unit time, as well as,\nby the pairs lifetime. It is found that the calculated value for the vacuum\ndensity is in surprisingly good agreement with the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 11:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}
