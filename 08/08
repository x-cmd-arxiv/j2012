A self-consistent stationary, axisymmetric model of the magnetar\nmagnetosphere is constructed based on a force-free magnetic field configuration\nwhich contains a helically twisted force-free flux rope. Given the complex\nmultipolar magnetic fields at the magnetar surface, we also develop a\nconvenient numerical scheme to solve the GS equation. Depending on the surface\nmagnetic field polarity, there exist two kinds of magnetic field\nconfigurations, inverse and normal. For these two kinds of configurations,\nvariations of the flux rope equilibrium height in response to gradual surface\nphysical processes, such as flux injections and crust motions, are carefully\nexamined. We find that equilibrium curves contain two branches, one represents\na stable equilibrium branch, the other an unstable equilibrium branch. As a\nresult, the evolution of the system shows a catastrophic behavior: when the\nmagnetar surface magnetic field evolves slowly, the height of flux rope would\ngradually reach a critical value beyond which stable equilibriums can no longer\nbe maintained. Subsequently the flux rope would lose equilibrium and the\ngradual quasi-static evolution of the magnetar magnetosphere will be replaced\nby a fast dynamical evolution. In addition to flux injections, the relative\nmotion of active regions would give rise to the catastrophic behavior and lead\nto magnetic eruptions as well. We propose that a gradual process could lead to\na sudden release of magnetosphere energy on a very short dynamical timescale,\nwithout being initiated by a sudden fracture in the crust of the magnetar. Some\nimplications of our model are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 16:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The emergent spectra\nof all models are redshifted and fitted by diluted blackbody spectra in the\n3--20 keV energy range appropriate for the RXTE/PCA. We also compute the color\ncorrection factors f_c. The radiative acceleration g_rad in our luminous,\nhot-atmosphere models is significantly smaller than in corresponding models\nbased on the Kompaneets operator, because of the Klein-Nishina reduction of the\nelectron scattering cross-section, and therefore formally \"super-Eddington\"\nmodel atmospheres do exist. The differences between the new and old model\natmospheres are small for L / L_Edd < 0.8. For the same g_rad / g, the new f_c\nare slightly larger (by approximately 1%) than the old values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 16:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-14"}

This method avoids known star formation and chemical enrichment\nproblems encountered in simulations. Here we focus on the Milky Way, by using a\ndetailed thin-disk chemical evolution model and a simulation in the\ncosmological context, with dynamical properties close to those of our Galaxy.\nWe show that, due to radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the\ncentral bar at later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor\nhigh-[alpha/Fe] stars reaches the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a\nnumber of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite\nthe fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant radial\nmixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is only weakly\naffected, with a scatter compatible with recent observational work. While we\nfind a smooth density distribution in the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, we can recover\nthe observed discontinuity by selecting particles according to kinematic\ncriteria used in high-resolution samples to define the thin and thick disks. We\noutline a new method for estimating the birth place of the Sun and predict that\nthe most likely radius lies in the range 4.4 < r < 7.7 kpc (for a location at r\n= 8 kpc). A new, unifying model for the Milky Way thick disk is offered, where\nboth mergers and radial migration play a role at different stages of the disk\nevolution. We show that in the absence of early-on massive mergers the vertical\nvelocity dispersion of the oldest stars is underestimated by a factor of ~2\ncompared with observations. We can, therefore, argue that the Milky Way thick\ndisk is unlikely to have been formed through a quiescent disk evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2013 15:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2013 19:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Our\ngoal is to correct the biases present in the theoretical predictions for the\nnear-IR photometry of low-mass PMS stars.

We consider a sample of ~300 PMS stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (age\n1 Myr) with measured luminosities, temperatures and photospheric JHKs\nphotometry. By analyzing the photospheric colors of our sample of stars, we\nfind that the synthetic JHKs photometry provided by theoretical spectral\ntemplates for late spectral types (>K6) are accurate at the level of ~0.2 mag,\nwhile colors are accurate at ~0.1 mag. We tabulate the intrinsic photospheric\ncolors, appropriate for the Orion Nebula Cluster, in the range K6-M8.5. They\ncan be conveniently used as templates for the intrinsic colors of other young\n(age<5 Myr) stellar clusters. An empirical correction of the atmospheric\ntemplates can fix the discrepancies between expected and observed colors.\nStill, other biases in the evolutionary models prevent a more robust comparison\nbetween observations and theoretical absolute magnitudes. In particular, PMS\nevolutionary models seem to consistently underestimate the intrinsic\nnear-infrared flux at the very late spectral types, and this may introduce\nspurious features in the low-mass end of the photometrically-determined Initial\nMass Function of young clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 20:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-01"}

Instead,\nit was recently shown in literature that an acceleration of order H and\ndirected along the velocity v of the test particle occurs at post-Newtonian\nlevel. We worked out its orbital effects finding well-behaved secular rates of\nchange for both a and e proportional to the Schwarzschild radius r_s of the\nprimary. Their magnitude is quite small: the rate of change of a amounts to\njust 20 microns per century in our Solar System. Finally, we discussed certain\nbasic criteria of viability that modified models of gravity should generally\nmeet when their observable effects are calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 20:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 13:32:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 14:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 15:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-15"}

We focus on the structures and dynamics of\nthis prominence before the eruption. This prominence contains two parts: an\nactive region part containing mainly horizontal threads, and a quiet Sun part\ncontaining mainly vertical threads. On the northern side of the prominence\nchannel, both AIA and EUVI observe bright features which appear to be the lower\nlegs of loops that go above then join in the filament. Filament materials are\nobserved to frequently eject horizontally from the active region part to the\nquiet Sun part. This ejection results in the formation of a dense-column\nstructure (concentration of dark vertical threads) near the border between the\nactive region and the quiet Sun. Using the flux rope insertion method, we\ncreate non-linear force-free field models based on SDO/HMI line-of-sight\nmagnetograms. A key feature of these models is that the flux rope has\nconnections with the surroundings photosphere, so its axial flux varies along\nthe filament path. The height and location of the dips of field lines in our\nmodels roughly replicate those of the observed prominence. Comparison between\nmodel and observations suggests that the bright features on the northern side\nof the channel are the lower legs of the field lines that turn into the flux\nrope. We suggest that plasma may be injected into the prominence along these\nfield lines. Although the models fit the observations quiet well, there are\nalso some interesting differences. For example, the models do not reproduce the\nobserved vertical threads and cannot explain the formation of the dense-column\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 20:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

In this work, we are\ninterested in permutations which are sortable on a double-ended queue (called a\ndeque), or on two parallel stacks. In 1982, Rosenstiehl and Tarjan presented an\nO(n) algorithm for testing whether a given permutation was sortable on parallel\nstacks. In the same paper, they also presented a modification giving O(n) test\nfor sortability on a deque. We demonstrate a slight error in the version of\ntheir algorithm for testing deque sortability, and present a fix for this\nproblem.\n  The general enumeration problem for both of these classes of permutations\nremains unsolved. What is known is that the growth rate of both classes is\napproximately Theta(8^n), so computing the number of sortable permutations of\nlength n, even for small values of n, is difficult to do using any method that\nmust evaluate each sortable permutation individually. As far as we know, the\nnumber of deque sortable permutations was known only up to n=14. This was\ncomputed using algorithms which effectively generate all sortable permutations.\nBy using the symmetries inherent in the execution of Tarjan's algorithm, we\nhave developed a new dynamic programming algorithm which can count the number\nof sortable permutations in both classes in O(n^5 2^n) time, allowing the\ncalculation of the number of deque and parallel stack sortable permutation for\nmuch higher values of n than was previously possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 21:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-16"}

Indeed, the\ninclusion of these channels along the decay evaporating chain shows that the\nyield of charged particles and occurrence of fission are affected by these\nmultiparticle emission processes of the compounded nucleus, when compared to\nthe single sequential emission results. The effect also shows a qualitative\nchange in the neutron multiplicity of different heavy compound nucleus\nconsidered.

The tile self-assembly model is a premiere model of self-assembly\nin which particles are modeled by four-sided squares with glue types assigned\nto each tile edge. The assembly process is driven by positive and negative\nforce interactions between glue types, allowing for tile assemblies floating in\nthe plane to combine and break apart over time. We refer to this type of\nassembly model as passive in that the constituent parts remain unchanged\nthroughout the assembly process regardless of their interactions. A\ncomputationally universal system is said to be fuel efficient if the number of\ntiles used up per computation step is bounded by a constant. Work within this\nmodel has shown how fuel guzzling tile systems can perform universal\ncomputation with only positive strength glue interactions. Recent work has\nintroduced space-efficient, fuel-guzzling universal computation with the\naddition of negative glue interactions and the use of a powerful non-diagonal\nclass of glue interactions.

The Lande-factor $g$ is introduced to describe the strength of\nparamagnetic effect which comes from the spin degree of freedom. The\nmagnetization density $\\bar M$ increases monotonically with $g$ for fixed\nreduced ferromagnetic coupling $\\bar I$ as $\\bar I>\\bar I_{c}$. In a weak\nmagnetic field, ferromagnetism makes immense contribution to the magnetization\ndensity. While at a high magnetic field, the diamagnetism inclines to saturate.\nEvidence for condensation can be seen in the magnetization density at weak\nmagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 05:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Comparison of the\nphoto-response of the prototype systems such as the band insulator LaAlO3 and\nMott insulator LaTiO3 films on TiO2 terminated SrTiO3 show remarkably\nsimilarities. Two types of non-equilibrium carriers are generated in each\nsystem, having a signature of a particular type of perturbation characterized\nby distinctly different relaxation process.

The slow decay of the photo-current to the unperturbed state is\nexplained in terms of the closely spaced Ti 3dxy states in the lower conduction\nband, which are manifested as flat bands (or localized states) in the band\nstructure. Such localization leads to increased carrier life-times, through the\nenergy-time relationship of the uncertainty principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 05:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

Selective\nconstraints on residue sites are recorded in amino acid orders in homologous\nsequences and also in the evolutionary trace of amino acid substitutions. A\nchallenge is to extract direct dependences between residue sites by removing\nindirect dependences through other residues within a protein or even through\nother molecules. Recent attempts of disentangling direct from indirect\ndependences of amino acid types between residue positions in multiple sequence\nalignments have revealed that the strength of inferred residue pair couplings\nis an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures.\nHere, we report an alternative attempt of inferring co-evolving site pairs from\nconcurrent and compensatory substitutions between sites in each branch of a\nphylogenetic tree. First, branch lengths of a phylogenetic tree inferred by the\nneighbor-joining method are optimized as well as other parameters by maximizing\na likelihood of the tree in a mechanistic codon substitution model. Mean\nchanges of quantities, which are characteristic of concurrent and compensatory\nsubstitutions, accompanied by substitutions at each site in each branch of the\ntree are estimated with the likelihood of each substitution. Partial\ncorrelation coefficients of the characteristic changes along branches between\nsites are calculated and used to rank co-evolving site pairs. Accuracy of\ncontact prediction based on the present co-evolution score is comparable to\nthat achieved by a maximum entropy model of protein sequences for 15 protein\nfamilies taken from the Pfam release 26.0. Besides, this excellent accuracy\nindicates that compensatory substitutions are significant in protein evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 07:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-18"}

The measured multi-frequency\nangular power spectrum C_l(Delta nu) is found to have values in the range 10^4\nmK^2 to 2 x 10^4 mK^2 across 700 <= l <= 2 x 10^4 and Delta nu <= 2.5 MHz,\nwhich is consistent with model predictions where point sources are the most\ndominant foreground component. The measured C_l(Delta nu) does not show a\nsmooth Delta nu dependence, which poses a severe difficulty for foreground\nremoval using polynomial fitting.\n  The observational data was used to assess point source subtraction.\nConsidering the brightest source (~ 1 Jy) in each field, we find that the\nresidual artifacts are less than 1.5% in the most sensitive field (FIELD I). We\nhave used FIELD I, which has a rms noise of 1.3 mJy/Beam, to study the\nproperties of the radio source population to a limiting flux of 9 mJy. The\ndifferential source count is well fitted with a single power law of slope -1.6.\nWe find there is no evidence for flattening of the source counts towards lower\nflux densities which suggests that source population is dominated by the\nclassical radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).\n  The diffuse Galactic emission is revealed after the point sources are\nsubtracted out from FIELD I . We find C_l \\propto l^{-2.34} for 253 <= l <= 800\nwhich is characteristic of the Galactic synchrotron radiation measured at\nhigher frequencies and larger angular scales. We estimate the fluctuations in\nthe Galactic synchrotron emission to be sqrt{l(l+1)C_l/2 pi} ~ 10 K at l=800\n(theta > 10'). The measured C_l is dominated by the residual point sources and\nartifacts at smaller angular scales where C_l ~ 10^3 mK^2 for l > 800.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 09:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-24"}

Additional\nevidence is provided of what we interpret as the onset of the tilt instability,\nwhen is initially frustrated by lattice disorder, and the long range order is\nachieved at lower temperature. Its temperature T_IT(x) prosecutes the long\nrange tilt instability line T_T(x) up to T_C, when T_T. It is proposed that the\ndifficulty of seeing the expected 1/2<111> modulations in diffraction\nexperiments is due to the large correlation volume associated with that type of\ntilt fluctuations combined with strong lattice disorder. It is shown that the\nlines of the tilt instabilities tend to be attracted and merge with those of\npolar instabilities. Not only T_IT bends toward T_C and then merges with it,\nbut in our series of samples the temperature T_MPB of the dielectric and\nanelastic maxima at the rhombohedral/tetragonal MPB does not cross T_T, but\ndeviates remaining parallel or possibly merging with T_T. These features,\ntogether with a similar one in NBT-BT, are discussed in terms of cooperative\ncoupling between tilt and FE instabilities, which may trigger a common phase\ntransition. An analogy is found with recent simulations of the tilt and FE\ntransitions in multiferroic BiFeO3. An abrupt change is found in the shape of\nthe anelastic anomaly at T_T when x passes from 0.465 to 0.48, possibly\nindicative of a rhombohedral/monoclinic boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 09:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2012 10:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

The players push a token along\nthe edges of the digraph. The winner is determined by the parity of the\ngreatest priority occurring infinitely often in this infinite play.\n  A motivation for studying parity games comes from the area of formal\nverification of systems by model checking. Deciding the winner in a parity game\nis polynomial time equivalent to the model checking problem of the modal\nmu-calculus. Another strong motivation lies in the fact that the exact\ncomplexity of solving parity games is a long-standing open problem, the\ncurrently best known algorithm being subexponential. It is known that the\nproblem is in the complexity classes UP and coUP.\n  In this paper we identify restricted classes of digraphs where the problem is\nsolvable in polynomial time, following an approach from structural graph\ntheory. We consider three standard graph operations: the join of two graphs,\nrepeated pasting along vertices, and the addition of a vertex. Given a class C\nof digraphs on which we can solve parity games in polynomial time, we show that\nthe same holds for the class obtained from C by applying once any of these\nthree operations to its elements.\n  These results provide, in particular, polynomial time algorithms for parity\ngames whose underlying graph is an orientation of a complete graph, a complete\nbipartite graph, a block graph, or a block-cactus graph. These are classes\nwhere the problem was not known to be efficiently solvable.\n  Previous results concerning restricted classes of parity games which are\nsolvable in polynomial time include classes of bounded tree-width, bounded\nDAG-width, and bounded clique-width.\n  We also prove that recognising the winning regions of a parity game is not\neasier than computing them from scratch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 11:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

One of the main advantage of a biometric\ntime and attendance system is it avoids \"buddy-punching\". Buddy punching was a\nmajor loophole which will be exploiting in the traditional time attendance\nsystems. Fingerprint recognition is an established field today, but still\nidentifying individual from a set of enrolled fingerprints is a time taking\nprocess. Most fingerprint-based biometric systems store the minutiae template\nof a user in the database. It has been traditionally assumed that the minutiae\ntemplate of a user does not reveal any information about the original\nfingerprint. This belief has now been shown to be false; several algorithms\nhave been proposed that can reconstruct fingerprint images from minutiae\ntemplates. In this paper, a novel fingerprint reconstruction algorithm is\nproposed to reconstruct the phase image, which is then converted into the\ngrayscale image. The proposed reconstruction algorithm reconstructs the phase\nimage from minutiae.

As the sample has been selected\nsolely on the basis of spectral types it contains an selection of B stars in\nthe field, in clusters, and in OB associations. The vsini distribution obtained\nfor the entire sample is found to be essentially flat for vsini values between\n0-150 km/s, with only a modest peak at low projected rotational velocities.\nConsidering subsamples of stars, there appears to be a gradation in the vsini\ndistribution with the field stars presenting a larger fraction of the slow\nrotators and the cluster stars distribution showing an excess of stars with\nvsini between 70 and 130 km/s. Furthermore, for a subsample of potential\nrunaway stars we find that the vsini distribution resembles the distribution\nseen in denser environments, which could suggest that these runaway stars have\nbeen subject to dynamical ejection mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 14:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-03"}

Here, we study the complexity of finding an optimal polytree that can be\nturned into a branching by deleting some number of arcs or nodes, treated as a\nparameter.\n  We show that the problem can be solved via a matroid intersection formulation\nin polynomial time if the number of deleted arcs is bounded by a constant. The\norder of the polynomial time bound depends on this constant, hence the\nalgorithm does not establish fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by\nthe number of deleted arcs. We show that a restricted version of the problem\nallows fixed-parameter tractability and hence scales well with the parameter.\nWe contrast this positive result by showing that if we parameterize by the\nnumber of deleted nodes, a somewhat more powerful parameter, the problem is not\nfixed-parameter tractable, subject to a complexity-theoretic assumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 15:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2012 13:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-16"}

Existing detection algorithms are commonly found to be\nunreliable in the case of IFS data and the optimal parameter settings are\nusually unknown a-priori for a given dataset. The CALIFA survey generates\nhundreds of IFS datasets for which a reliable and robust detection algorithm\nfor cosmics is required as an important part of the fully automatic CALIFA data\nreduction pipeline. We developed a novel algorithm, PyCosmic, which combines\nthe edge-detection algorithm of L.A.Cosmic with a point-spread function\nconvolution scheme. We generated mock data to compute the efficiency of\ndifferent algorithms for a wide range of characteristic fibre-fed IFS datasets\nusing the PMAS and VIMOS IFS instruments as representative cases. PyCosmic is\nthe only algorithm that achieves an acceptable detection performance for CALIFA\ndata. We find that PyCosmic is the most robust tool with a detection rate of\n>~90% and a false detection rate <5% for any of the tested IFS data. It has one\nless free parameter than the L.A.Cosmic algorithm. Only for strongly\nundersampled IFS data does L.A.Cosmic exceed the performance of PyCosmic by a\nfew per cent. DCR never reaches the efficiency of the other two algorithms and\nshould only be used if computational speed is a concern. Thus, PyCosmic appears\nto be the most versatile cosmics detection algorithm for IFS data. It is\nimplemented in the new CALIFA data reduction pipeline as well as in recent\nversions of the multi-instrument IFS pipeline P3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 15:48:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2012 14:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-02"}
