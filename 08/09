This\ncurvature ultimately results from postulating a discrete spacetime geometry,\nvery closely related to that used in the dynamical triangulations approach to\nquantum gravity. In this model, there are no states which have total scalar\ncurvature exactly zero. Moreover, numerical evidence in dimension three\nsuggests that, at a fixed volume, the number of discrete-spacetime microstates\nstrongly increases with decreasing curvature. Because of the resulting entropic\nforce, any dynamics which push empty spacetime strongly toward zero scalar\ncurvature would instead produce typically observed states with a small negative\ncurvature. This provides a natural explanation for the empirically observed\nsmall positive value for the cosmological constant (Lambda is about 10^(-121)\nin Planck units.) In fact, we derive the very rough estimate Lambda=10^(-187)\nfrom a simple model containing only the two (highly-degenerate) quantum states\nwith total scalar-curvature closest to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 17:58:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 21:37:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 19:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-16"}

As\nexpected from the analogy with a particle in a double-well potential,\ntransitions between these states become possible either at finite temperature,\nor in the quantum regime due to tunneling. In this analogy, besides local\nstability, one can also discuss global stability by comparing the two potential\nminima. For the Duffing oscillator, the stationary states emerge dynamically so\nthat a priori, a potential-minimum criterion for them does not exist. However,\nglobal stability is still relevant, and definable as the state containing the\nmajority population for long times, low temperature, and close to the classical\nlimit. Further, the crossover point is the parameter value at which global\nstability abruptly changes from one state to the other.\n  For the double-well model, the crossover point is defined by\npotential-minimum degeneracy. Given that this analogy is so effective in other\nrespects, it is thus striking that for the Duffing oscillator, the crossover\npoint turns out to be non-unique. Rather, none of the three aforementioned\nlimits commute with each other, and the limiting behaviour depends on the order\nin which they are taken. More generally, as both $\\hbar\\To0$ and $T\\To0$, the\nratio $\\hbar\\omega_0/k_\\mathrm{B}T$ continues to be a key parameter and can\nhave any nonnegative value. This points to an apparent conceptual difference\nbetween equilibrium and nonequilibrium tunneling.

This approach neglects the\nassociated performance losses in the thermal system and leads to a decrease in\nthe overall exergy of the system. Consequently, this paper explores the use of\nhydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) as an absorber material for PVT in an\neffort to maintain higher and more favourable operating temperatures for the\nthermal system. Amorphous silicon not only has a smaller temperature\ncoefficient than c-Si, but also can display improved PV performance over\nextended periods of higher temperatures by annealing out defect states from the\nStaebler-Wronski effect. In order to determine the potential improvements in\na-Si:H PV performance associated with increased thicknesses of the i-layers\nmade possible by higher operating temperatures, a-Si:H PV cells were tested\nunder 1 sun illumination (AM1.5) at temperatures of 25oC (STC), 50oC\n(representative PV operating conditions), and 90 oC (representative PVT\noperating conditions).

By analysing complementary radio-selected control\nsamples, we find evidence that these conclusions are not an effect of the X-ray\nselection, but are likely a property of the dominant QSO population. Our\nfindings are best interpreted in a context where radio emission in AGN, with\nthe exception of a minority of beamed sources, arises from very close to the\naccretion disk and is therefore heavily linked to X-ray emission. We also\nspeculate that the RL/RQ dichotomy might either be an evolutionary effect that\ndeveloped well after the QSO peak epoch, or an effect of incompleteness in\nsmall samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 17:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We show that the ROA can be computed by solving an\ninfinite-dimensional convex linear programming (LP) problem over the space of\nmeasures. In turn, this problem can be solved approximately via a classical\nconverging hierarchy of convex finite-dimensional linear matrix inequalities\n(LMIs). Our approach is genuinely primal in the sense that convexity of the\nproblem of computing the ROA is an outcome of optimizing directly over system\ntrajectories. The dual infinite-dimensional LP on nonnegative continuous\nfunctions (approximated by polynomial sum-of-squares) allows us to generate a\nhierarchy of semialgebraic outer approximations of the ROA at the price of\nsolving a sequence of LMI problems with asymptotically vanishing conservatism.\nThis sharply contrasts with the existing literature which follows an\nexclusively dual Lyapunov approach yielding either nonconvex bilinear matrix\ninequalities or conservative LMI conditions. The approach is simple and readily\napplicable as the outer approximations are the outcome of a single semidefinite\nprogram with no additional data required besides the problem description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 19:50:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2013 16:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-02"}

The mass of clay is submitted\nto gradients of pore pressure and temperature, to hydraulic and thermal flows,\nand to changes in its mechanical properties. In this work, some of these\naspects were experimentally studied in the case of Boom clay, so as to help\npredicting the response of the soil, in relation with investigations made in\nthe Belgian underground laboratory at Mol. Results of slow heating tests with\ncareful volume change measurements showed that a reasonable prediction of the\nthermal expansion of the clay-water system was obtained by using the thermal\nproperties of free water. In spite of the density of Boom clay, no significant\neffect of water adsorption was observed. The thermal consolidation of Boom clay\nwas studied through fast heating tests. A simple analysis shows that the\nhydraulic and thermal transfers are uncoupled. Experimental results from fast\nheating tests showed that the consolidation coefficient does not change\nsignificantly with increased temperature, due to the opposite effect of\nincreasing permeability and decreasing porosity. The changes of permeability\nwith temperature were investigated by running constant head measurements at\nvarious temperatures. An indirect analysis, based on the estimation of the mv\nconsolidation parameter, showed that the indirect method of estimating the\npermeability from consolidation tests should be considered carefully. Intrinsic\npermeability values were derived by considering the change of the viscosity of\nfree water with temperature. A unique relationship between the intrinsic\npermeability and the porosity was observed, with no dependence on temperature,\nconfirming that the flow involved in the permeability test only concerns free\nwater.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 19:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

For LtS galaxies we find\nsimilar mean values for the stellar content and age in the two samples.\nHowever, we note that LtS can be split into two subclasses, namely old and\nyoung LtS.

Though secular\nperturbations from the binary can align the disk, in both cases the alignment\ntime at the distances at which the disk is resolved is greater than the stellar\nage, so we conclude that the coplanarity was primordial. Neither disk can be\nmodelled as a narrow ring, requiring extended radial distributions. To satisfy\nboth the Herschel and mid-IR images of the alpha CrB disk, we construct a model\nthat extends from 1-300AU, whose radial profile is broadly consistent with a\npicture where planetesimal collisions are excited by secular perturbations from\nthe binary. However, this model is also consistent with stirring by other\nmechanisms, such as the formation of Pluto-sized objects. The beta Tri disk\nmodel extends from 50-400AU. A model with depleted (rather than empty) inner\nregions also reproduces the observations and is consistent with binary and\nother stirring mechanisms. As part of the modelling process, we find that the\nHerschel PACS beam varies by as much as 10% at 70um and a few % at 100um. The\n70um variation can therefore hinder image interpretation, particularly for\npoorly resolved objects.

Water content helps determine surface\nland fraction, which influences planetary weathering behavior. This is\nimportant because the silicate weathering feedback determines the width of the\nhabitable zone in space and time. Here a low-order model of weathering and\nclimate, useful for gaining qualitative understanding, is developed to examine\nclimate evolution for planets of various land-ocean fractions. It is pointed\nout that, if seafloor weathering does not depend directly on surface\ntemperature, there can be no weathering-climate feedback on a waterworld. This\nwould dramatically narrow the habitable zone of a waterworld. Results from our\nmodel indicate that weathering behavior does not depend strongly on land\nfraction for partially ocean-covered planets. This is powerful because it\nsuggests that previous habitable zone theory is robust to changes in land\nfraction, as long as there is some land. Finally, a mechanism is proposed for a\nwaterworld to prevent complete water loss during a moist greenhouse through\nrapid weathering of exposed continents. This process is named a \"waterworld\nself-arrest,\" and it implies that waterworlds can go through a moist greenhouse\nstage and end up as planets like Earth with partial ocean coverage.

We then use linear and nonlinear\nkinetic theory to study the stability of the pair beam against the growth of\nelectrostatic plasma waves, employing the Monte Carlo results for our\nquantitative estimates. We find that the fastest growing mode, like any\nperturbation mode with even a very modest component perpendicular to the beam\ndirection, cannot be described in the reactive regime. Due to the effect of\nnon-linear Landau damping, which suppresses the growth of plasma oscillations,\nthe beam relaxation timescale is found significantly longer than the inverse\nCompton loss time. Finally, density inhomogeneities associated with cosmic\nstructure induce loss of resonance between the beam particles and plasma\noscillations, strongly inhibiting their growth.

After\nseparating the tracers into bulge and disk components we find the bulge to be a\nslowly rotating pressure-supported system, whereas the disk reveals a rapidly\nrising rotation curve with a declining velocity dispersion profile. The\nresulting V/sigma ratio for the disk resembles that of a spiral galaxy and\nhints at an origin for NGC 2768 as a transformed late-type galaxy. A\ntwo-component kinematic analysis for a sample of S0s will help to elucidate the\nnature of this class of galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 20:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This spin-up mechanism is one possible explanation for\nthe rapid rotators detected among the population of generally slow-rotating red\ngiant stars. These rapid rotators thus comprise a unique stellar sample\nsuitable for searching for signatures of planet accretion in the form of\nunusual stellar abundances due to the dissemination of the accreted planet in\nthe stellar envelope. In this study, we look for signatures of replenishment in\nthe Li abundances and (to a lesser extent) 12C/13C, which are both normally\nlowered during RGB evolution. Accurate abundances were measured from high\nsignal-to-noise echelle spectra for samples of both slow and rapid rotator red\ngiant stars. We find that the rapid rotators are on average enriched in lithium\ncompared to the slow rotators, but both groups of stars have identical\ndistributions of 12C/13C within our measurement precision. Both of these\nabundance results are consistent with the accretion of planets of only a few\nJupiter masses. We also explore alternative scenarios for understanding the\nmost Li-rich stars in our sample---particularly Li regeneration during various\nstages of stellar evolution. Finally, we find that our stellar samples show\nnon-standard abundances even at early RGB stages, suggesting that initial\nprotostellar Li abundances and 12C/13C may be more variable than originally\nthought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2012 20:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-13"}

It\nis also found that a tubular phase appears when the vector field is constant.\nMoreover, we find that the tilts form the Kosterlitz-Thouless and low\ntemperature configurations, which correspond to two different anisotropic\nphases such as disk and tubular, in the model in which the tilt variable is\nassumed to be a dynamical variable. This confirms that the model in this paper\nmay be used as an anisotropic model for membranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 02:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2013 03:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

To explore\nsituations with differing bar strength, we vary the bar mass fbar relative to\nthe spheroidal component as well as its aspect ratio. We derive expressions as\nfunctions of fbar and the aspect ratio for the bar strength Qb and the radius\nr(Qb) where the maximum bar torque occurs. When applied to observations, these\nexpressions suggest that bars in real galaxies are most likely to have\nfbar=0.25-0.5 and n<1. Dust lanes approximately follow one of x1-orbits and\ntend to be more straight under a stronger and more elongated bar, but are\ninsensitive to the presence of self-gravity. A nuclear ring of a conventional\nx2 type forms only when the bar is not so massive or elongated. The radius of\nan x2-type ring is generally smaller than the inner Lindblad resonance,\ndecreases systematically with increasing Qb, and slightly larger when\nself-gravity is included. This evidences that the ring position is not\ndetermined by the resonance but by the amount of angular momentum loss at\ndust-lane shocks. Nuclear spirals exist only when the ring is of the x2-type\nand sufficiently large in size. Unlike the other features, nuclear spirals are\ntransient in that they start out as being tightly-wound and weak, and then due\nto the nonlinear effect unwind and become stronger until turning into shocks,\nwith an unwinding rate higher for larger Qb.

The widely accepted presence of\nclumping in hot star winds implies a significant reduction of observational\nmass-loss rate estimates from diagnostics that depend on the square of the\ndensity. Moreover, the ultraviolet Pv resonance lines indicate a possible need\nfor even stronger reduction of hot star mass-loss rates, provided that Pv is a\ndominant ionization stage of phosphorus at least in some hot stars. The latter\nassumption is challenged by a possible presence of the XUV radiation.\n  Here we study the influence of the XUV radiation on the Pv ionization\nfraction in the hot star winds. By a detailed solution of the hydrodynamical,\nradiative transfer, and statistical equilibrium equations we confirm that\nsufficiently strong XUV radiation source may decrease the Pv ionization\nfraction, possibly depreciating the Pv lines as a reliable mass-loss rate\nindicator. On the other hand, the XUV radiation influences also the ionization\nfraction of heavier ions that drive the wind, leading to a decrease of the wind\nterminal velocity. Consequently, we conclude that the XUV radiation alone can\nnot bring theory and observations in accord.\n  We fit our predicted wind mass-loss rates by a suitable formula and compare\nthe results with the observational mass-loss rate diagnostics. We show that for\nsupergiants and giants the theoretical predictions do not contradict the\nmass-loss rate estimates based on X-ray line profiles or density squared\ndiagnostics. On the other hand, for main-sequence stars the predicted mass-loss\nrates are still significantly higher than that inferred from Pv or X-ray lines.\nThis indicates that the \"weak wind problem\" recently detected in low-luminosity\nmain-sequence stars may occur to some extent also for the stars with higher\nluminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 07:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

By\nemploying the modified formulation of the PKN problem we obtain its simple\nanalytical solutions in the cases of perfectly plastic and Newtonian fluids.\nSince the results for shear thinning fluids are intermediate between those for\nthese cases, the obtained equation for the fracture length suggests a criterion\nof the equivalence of various shear thinning fluids for the problem of\nhydraulic fractures. We assume fluids equivalent in their hydrofracturing\naction, when at a reference time they produce fractures of the same length. The\nequation for the fracture length translates the equivalence in terms of the\nhydraulic fracture length and treatment time into the equivalence in terms of\nthe properties of a fracturing fluid (behavior and consistency indices).\nAnalysis shows that the influence of the consistency and behavior indices on\nthe fracture length, particle velocity and propagation speed is quite similar\nwhen considering the PKN and KGD models despite the models refer to different\nplain-strain states. It appears that from the mechanical point of view, the\ndifferences between thinning fluids are not significant; they may be taken into\naccount when wishing to have some quantity to be greater (less) at small\n(large) time. We conclude that a choice of a fracturing fluid is to be made\nmostly from technological and/or economic considerations under the condition\nthat the compared fluids are equivalent in their mechanical effect according to\nthe suggested criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 08:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-10"}

In this paper we discuss a mechanism that may\nfill this gap. We establish that small scale inertial r-modes become unstable\nin a superfluid neutron star that exhibits a rotational lag, expected to build\nup due to vortex pinning as the star spins down. Somewhat counterintuitively,\nthis instability arises due to the (under normal circumstances dissipative)\nvortex-mediated mutual friction. We explore the nature of the superfluid\ninstability for a simple incompressible model, allowing for entrainment\ncoupling between the two fluid components. Our results recover a previously\ndiscussed dynamical instability in systems where the two components are\nstrongly coupled. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that the\nsystem is secularly unstable (with a growth time that scales with the mutual\nfriction) throughout much of parameter space. Interestingly, large scale\nr-modes are also affected by this new aspect of the instability. We analyse the\ndamping effect of shear viscosity, which should be particularly efficient at\nsmall scales, arguing that it will not be sufficient to completely suppress the\ninstability in astrophysical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 09:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-27"}

Technically, the symmetry is\nassumed to be broken by formation of symmetry-breaking parts of both the scalar\nand the fermion propagators, rather than by the scalar vacuum expectation\nvalues. The idea is first introduced on an example of a toy model with the\nunderlying symmetry being an Abelian one and later applied to a realistic model\nof electroweak interaction. In addition, the thesis also deals with some more\ngeneral, model-independent issues, applicable not only to the discussed model\nof strong Yukawa dynamics, but to a wider class of models with dynamical mass\ngeneration. First of these issues is the problem of fermion flavor mixing in\nthe presence of fermion self-energies with a general momentum dependence. It is\nin particular shown how to define the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in\nsuch models and argued that it can come out in principle non-unitary.

The content distribution techniques have recently\nstarted to embrace peer-to-peer (P2P) systems as an alternative to the\ntraditional client-server architecture. P2P systemsthat are based on the\nBitTorrent protocol uses end-users' resources to provide a cost effective\ndistribution of bandwidth intensive content to thousands of users. The\nBitTorrent protocol system offers a scalable mechanism for distributing a large\nvolume of data to a set of peers over the Internet. With the growing demand for\nfile sharing and content distribution, BitTorrent has become one of the most\npopular Internet applications and contributes to a signification fraction of\nthe Internet traffic. With the wide usage of the BitTorrent protocol system, it\nhas basically solved one of the major problems where data can be quickly\ntransferred to a group of interested parties. The strength of the BitTorrent\nprotocol lies in efficient bandwidth utilization for the downloading and\nuploading processes. However, the usage of BitTorrent protocol also causes\nlatency for other applications in terms of network bandwidth which in turn has\ncaused concerns for the Internet Service Providers, who strives for quality of\nservice for all their customers. In this paper, we study the network traffic\npatterns of theBitTorrent network traffic and investigate its behavior by\nusingthe time series ARMA model. Our experimental results show that BitTorrent\nnetwork traffic can be modeled and forecasted by using ARMA models. We compared\nand evaluated the forecasted network traffic with the real traffic patterns.\nThis modeling can be utilized by the Internet Service Providers to manage their\nnetwork bandwidth and also detect any abnormality in their network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 13:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-10"}

This new transformation\nintroduces non-inertial eccentric observers on a uniformly rotating disk and\nthe corresponding metric in the rotating frame is shown to be consistent with\nthe one obtained through Galilean rotational transformation for points close to\nthe rotation axis. Employing the threading formulation of spacetime\ndecomposition, spatial distances and time intervals in the spacetime metric of\na rotating observer's frame are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 13:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 11:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2014 07:27:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 13:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

These scintillations not only can reduce the\naccuracy of GPS/Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) receiver\npseudo-range and carrier phase measurement but also can result in a complete\nloss of lock on a satellite. Scintillation in the ionosphere varies as the sun\nspot number (SSN), Geomagnetic index (o < Kp < 9), time of year, time of day,\ngeographical position. Most scintillation occurs for a few hours after sunset\nduring the peak years of the solar cycle. Typically delay locked loop/phase\nlocked loop designs of GPS/SBAS receivers enable them to handle moderate amount\nif scintillations. Consequently, any attempt to determine the effects of\nscintillations on GPS/SBAS must consider both predictions of scintillation\nactivity in the ionosphere and residual effect of this activity after\nprocessing by a receiver. In this work dual frequency (f1 = 1.5 GHz, f2 = 1.2\nGHz) GPS data recorded at low latitude station Varanasi (Geographic latitude\n250 18/ N, longitude 820 59/ E) have been analyzed to monitor the amplitude\nscintillation index (S4) from January 2009 to December 2009.

One may,\nhowever, ask if a semiconducting band gap alone is sufficient to quench the\ncurrent in graphene. In this paper we demonstrate that despite a bulk band gap\ngraphene can still have metallic conductance along the sample edges (provided\nthat they are shorter than the localization length). We find this for\nsingle-layer graphene with a zigzag-type boundary which hosts gapless\npropagating edge states even in the presence of a bulk band gap. By generating\ninter-valley scattering, sample disorder reduces the edge conductance.
