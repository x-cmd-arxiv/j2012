Broad iron emission lines originating from\nthe irradiation of cool matter can indicate that there is an inner disk below a\nhot coronal flow.These emission lines have been detected in X-ray binaries.\nObservations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM Newton and Suzaku have\nconfirmed the presence of these emission lines also in a large fraction of\nSeyfert-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). We investigate the accretion flow\ngeometry for which broad iron emission lines can arise in hard and soft\nspectral state. We study an ADAF-type coronal flow, where the ions are\nviscously heated and electrons receive their heat only by collisions from the\nions and are Compton cooled by photons from an underlying cool disk. For a\nstrong mass flow in the disk and the resulting strong Compton cooling only a\nvery weak coronal flow is possible. This limitation allows the formation of\nADAF-type coronae above weak inner disks in the hard state, but almost rules\nthem out in the soft state. The observed hard X-ray luminosity in the soft\nstate, of up to 10% or more of the total flux, indicates that there is a\nheating process that directly accelerates the electrons.

More specifically, we propose alternative\nfixed core&adaptive width, adaptive core&fixed width, and adaptive\ncore&adaptive width strategies which enforce different constraints reflecting\nthe high level structural characteristics of the series in the data set.\nExperiment results show that the proposed sDTW algorithms help achieve much\nhigher accuracy in DTWcomputation and time series retrieval than fixed core &\nfixed width algorithms that do not leverage local features of the given time\nseries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 16:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-02"}

One problem many scientists\nshare is the analysis of the massive spatial models they build.

The Bloom filter, a compact data structure supporting set insertion\nand membership queries, has found wide application in databases, storage\nsystems, and networks. Because the Bloom filter performs frequent random reads\nand writes, it is used almost exclusively in RAM, limiting the size of the sets\nit can represent. This paper first describes the quotient filter, which\nsupports the basic operations of the Bloom filter, achieving roughly comparable\nperformance in terms of space and time, but with better data locality.\nOperations on the quotient filter require only a small number of contiguous\naccesses. The quotient filter has other advantages over the Bloom filter: it\nsupports deletions, it can be dynamically resized, and two quotient filters can\nbe efficiently merged. The paper then gives two data structures, the buffered\nquotient filter and the cascade filter, which exploit the quotient filter\nadvantages and thus serve as SSD-optimized alternatives to the Bloom filter.\nThe cascade filter has better asymptotic I/O performance than the buffered\nquotient filter, but the buffered quotient filter outperforms the cascade\nfilter on small to medium data sets.

In\nuncertain databases, the support of an itemset is a random variable instead of\na fixed occurrence counting of this itemset. Thus, unlike the corresponding\nproblem in deterministic databases where the frequent itemset has a unique\ndefinition, the frequent itemset under uncertain environments has two different\ndefinitions so far. The first definition, referred as the expected\nsupport-based frequent itemset, employs the expectation of the support of an\nitemset to measure whether this itemset is frequent. The second definition,\nreferred as the probabilistic frequent itemset, uses the probability of the\nsupport of an itemset to measure its frequency. Thus, existing work on mining\nfrequent itemsets over uncertain databases is divided into two different groups\nand no study is conducted to comprehensively compare the two different\ndefinitions. In addition, since no uniform experimental platform exists,\ncurrent solutions for the same definition even generate inconsistent results.\nIn this paper, we firstly aim to clarify the relationship between the two\ndifferent definitions. Through extensive experiments, we verify that the two\ndefinitions have a tight connection and can be unified together when the size\nof data is large enough. Secondly, we provide baseline implementations of eight\nexisting representative algorithms and test their performances with uniform\nmeasures fairly. Finally, according to the fair tests over many different\nbenchmark data sets, we clarify several existing inconsistent conclusions and\ndiscuss some new findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 17:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-02"}

In a Chinese auction, multiple\nplayers compete for several items by buying tickets, which can be used to win\nthe items. In front of each item there is a basket, and the players can bid by\nplacing tickets in the basket(s) corresponding to the item(s) they are trying\nto win. After all the players have placed their tickets, a ticket is drawn at\nrandom from each basket and the item is given to the owner of the winning\nticket. While a player is never guaranteed to win an item, they can improve\ntheir chances of getting it by increasing the number of tickets for that item.\n  In this paper we investigate the existence of pure Nash equilibria in both\nthe continuous and discrete settings. When the players have continuous budgets,\nwe show that a pure Nash equilibrium may not exist for asymmetric games when\nsome valuations are zero. In that case we prove that the auctioneer can\nstabilize the game by placing his own ticket in each basket. On the other hand,\nwhen all the valuations are strictly positive, a pure Nash equilibrium is\nguaranteed to exist, and the equilibrium strategies are symmetric when both\nvaluations and budgets are symmetric. We also study Chinese auctions with\ndiscrete budgets, for which we give both existence results and counterexamples.\nWhile the literature on rent-seeking contests traditionally focuses on\ncontinuous costly tickets, the discrete variant is very natural and more\nclosely models the version of the auction held in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 17:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2012 16:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-04"}

We use a statistical thermodynamic model to\ninvestigate the composition of the successive multiple guest clathrates that\nmay have formed during the cooling of the primordial nebula from the most\nabundant volatiles present in the gas phase. These clathrates agglomerated with\nthe other ices (pure condensates or stoichiometric hydrates) and formed the\nbuilding blocks of comets. We report that molecular nitrogen is a poor\nclathrate former, when we consider a plausible gas phase composition of the\nprimordial nebula. This implies that its trapping into cometesimals requires a\nlow disk temperature ($\\sim$20 K) in order to allow the formation of its pure\ncondensate. We find that it is possible to explain the lack of molecular\nnitrogen in comets as a consequence of their postformation internal heating\nengendered by the decay of short-lived radiogenic nuclides. This scenario is\nfound consistent with the presence of nitrogen-rich ice covers on Pluto and\nTriton.

The Teff we infer for the primary and secondary, from the\nTiO-epsilon bands alone, show the same reversal, in the same ratio, as is\nempirically observed, bolstering the validity of our analysis. In turn, this\nimplies that if suppression of convection by magnetic fields on the primary is\nthe fundamental cause of the Teff reversal, then it cannot be a local\nsuppression yielding spots mainly on the primary (though both components may be\nequally spotted), but a global suppression in the interior of the primary.

This work is based on optical photometry obtained for three GRB-SNe\nevents: GRB 060729, GRB 090618 and XRF 100316D (an X-Ray Flash is similar to a\nL-GRB, but has a lower peak energy). For GRB 060729 and GRB 090618 we model the\noptical light curves and account for light coming from three sources: the host\ngalaxy, the afterglow and the supernova. When we remove the host flux, and\nmodel the afterglow, the re- maining flux resembles that of a SN, both in the\nshape of the light curve and the shape of the spectral energy distribution.\n  Our investigation of XRF 100316D and its spectroscopically-confirmed Ic-BL SN\n2010bh is more detailed as we were able to obtain optical and infrared data in\nmany filters, which we utilize to created a quasi-bolometric light curve that\nwe model to determine physical parameters of the SN...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 18:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-02"}

We are given a\ncollection of n jobs, where each job has an integer length as well as a set Ti\nof time intervals in which it can be feasibly scheduled. Given a parameter B,\nthe processor can schedule up to B jobs at a timeslot t so long as it is\n\"active\" at t. The goal is to schedule all the jobs in the fewest number of\nactive timeslots. The machine consumes a fixed amount of energy per active\ntimeslot, regardless of the number of jobs scheduled in that slot (as long as\nthe number of jobs is non-zero). In other words, subject to all units of each\njob being scheduled in its feasible region and at each slot at most B jobs\nbeing scheduled, we are interested in minimizing the total time during which\nthe machine is active. We present a linear time algorithm for the case where\njobs are unit length and each Ti is a single interval. For general Ti, we show\nthat the problem is NP-complete even for B = 3. However when B = 2, we show\nthat it can be efficiently solved. In addition, we consider a version of the\nproblem where jobs have arbitrary lengths and can be preempted at any point in\ntime. For general B, the problem can be solved by linear programming. For B =\n2, the problem amounts to finding a triangle-free 2-matching on a special\ngraph. We extend the algorithm of Babenko et. al. to handle our variant, and\nalso to handle non-unit length jobs. This yields an O(sqrt(L)m) time algorithm\nto solve the preemptive scheduling problem for B = 2, where L is the sum of the\njob lengths. We also show that for B = 2 and unit length jobs, the optimal\nnon-preemptive schedule has at most 4/3 times the active time of the optimal\npreemptive schedule; this bound extends to several versions of the problem when\njobs have arbitrary length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 18:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-02"}

Narrow-band Pa-alpha image is obtained using\nthe ANIR near-infrared camera on the mini-TAO 1m telescope. The image enables\nus to derive accurate star formation rates within the galaxy directly. The\ntotal star formation rate, 22.2 M_sun/yr, was found to be much higher than\nprevious estimates. Ages of individual star forming blobs estimated from\nequivalent widths indicate that most star forming regions are ~7 Myr old,\nexcept for a giant HII region at the bridge which is much younger. Comparison\nbetween star formation rates and molecular gas masses for the regions with the\nsame age exhibits a surprisingly tight correlation, a slope of unity, and star\nformation efficiencies comparable to those of starburst galaxies. These results\nsuggest that Taffy I has just evolved into a starburst system after the\ncollision, and the star forming sites are at a similar stage in their evolution\nfrom natal molecular clouds except for the bridge region. The tight\nSchmidt-Kennicutt law supports the scenario that dispersion in the star\nformation law is in large part due to differences in evolutionary stage of star\nforming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 18:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Based on these simulations a\nnew relationship between scale size and galactocentric distance is derived: the\nscale size of star clusters is proportional to the hyperbolic tangent of the\ngalactocentric distance. The half-mass radius of star clusters increases\nsystematically with galactocentric distance but levels off when star clusters\norbit the galaxy beyond ~40 kpc. These simulations show that the half-mass\nradius of individual star clusters varies significantly as they evolve over a\nHubble time, more so for clusters with shorter relaxation times, and remains\nconstant through several relaxation times only in certain situations when\nexpansion driven by the internal dynamics of the star cluster and the influence\nof the host galaxy tidal field balance each other. Indeed, the radius of a star\ncluster evolving within the inner 20 kpc of a realistic galactic gravitational\npotential is severely truncated by tidal interactions and does not remain\nconstant over a Hubble time. Furthermore, the half-mass radius of star clusters\nmeasured with present day observations bears no memory of the original cluster\nsize. Stellar evolution and tidal stripping are the two competing physical\nmechanisms that determine the present day size of globular clusters. These\nsimulations also show that extended star clusters can form at large\ngalactocentric distances while remaining fully bound to the host galaxy. There\nis thus no need to invoke accretion from an external galaxy to explain the\npresence of extended clusters at large galactocentric distances in a Milky\nWay-type galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

At a given\nredshift, we selected the HST band that most closely samples a common\nrest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients in\ngalaxies. At fixed n_c, galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of ~3 from\nz~3 to z~0. The size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant in\nsize from z~3 to z~2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. The evolution in\nthe surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r<2 kpc\nwas in place by z~2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at larger\nradii. This inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the larger\nsizes and higher Sersic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. At z<2,\nthe effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as r_e M^{2.0}, consistent\nwith scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver of\nsize evolution.

We\nderive the coupled spin-charge dynamic equations in the presence of inelastic\nscattering and provide a new formalism that describes the spin relaxation and\ndynamics in both the weak and the strong SOC regime in a unified way. In the\nweak SOC regime, as expected, our theory reproduces all previous\nzero-temperature results, most of which have focused on impurity-scattering\ninduced spin-charge dynamics. In the regime where the strength of the Rashba\nand linear Dresselhaus SOC match, known as the SU(2) symmetry point,\nexperiments have observed the spin-helix mode with a large spin-lifetime whose\nunexplained non-monotonic temperature dependence peaks at around 75 K.

Does a algorithm use local or\nglobal network state? This is the key question in adaptive routing. In many\ntraffic patterns, the ignorance of global network state, leading to routing\nselection based only on local congestion information, tends to violate global\nload balance. To attack the load balance issue in adapting routing, some global\nadaptive routing algorithms introduce a congestion propagation network to\nobtain global network status information, such as Regional Congestion Awareness\n(RCA) and Destination Based Adaptive Routing (DBAR).\n  However, the congestion propagation network leads to additional power and\narea consumption which cannot be ignored. From another view, if we just\nincrease the bandwidth between neighbor nodes with the wires used to build the\ncongestion propagation network, the network performance could be improved as\nwell. In this paper, we propose a global adaptive routing algorithm without\nemploying the additional congestion propagation network. Our algorithm obtains\nthe global network state in a novel way, and can offer significant improvement\nthan the base-line local adaptive routing algorithm (xy-adaptive algorithm\nwhich selects routing based on local congestion information in each hop) for\nboth medium and high injection rates.\n  In wormhole flow control, all the routing information (flit id, source node\nid, destination node id, vc id and address) is contained in head flit, and data\nis carried in body flits. As a result, there are always many free bits in the\nhead flit, especially when the bandwidth is 128-bits which is normal in\ninterconnection network design. Then, we can use these free bits in the head\nflit to propagate global congestion information but not increase the number of\nflits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 02:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-03"}

In addition, their speed distribution is very narrow ($\\sim 20$\n{km/s}). The particles have isotropic velocity distribution (perhaps, in\ncontrast to the galactic dark matter). The extragalactic dark matter should\ngive a significant contribution to the direct detection signal. If the detector\nis sensitive only to the fast particles ($v<450$ {km/s}), the signal may even\ndominate.\n  The density of other possible types of the extragalactic dark matter (for\ninstance, of the diffuse component of the Virgo Supercluster) should be\nrelatively small and comparable with the average dark matter density of the\nUniverse.

These rich phases are expected due to the strong interplay between\ncharge, spin and orbital degree of freedom at the interface between these\ncomplex oxides, leading to the electronic reconstruction in this system.\nHowever, until now all of these new properties have been studied extensively\nbased on the interfaces which involve a polar LaAlO$_3$ layer. To investigate\nthe role of the A and B cationic sites of the ABO$_3$ polar layer, here we\nstudy various combinations of polar/nonpolar oxide (NdAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$,\nPrAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ and NdGaO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$) interfaces which are similar in\nnature to LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. Our results show that all of these new\ninterfaces can also produce 2DEG at their interfaces, supporting the idea that\nthe electronic reconstruction is the driving mechanism for the creation of the\n2DEG at these oxide interfaces. Furthermore, the electrical properties of these\ninterfaces are shown to be strongly governed by the interface strain and strong\ncorrelation effects provided by the polar layers. Our observations may provide\na novel approach to further tune the properties of the 2DEG at the selected\npolar/nonpolar oxide interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 06:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-31"}

The first is that recent studies of QT are considerably advanced over\nolder studies, which were chiefly limited to thermal counterflow in 4He, which\nhas no analogue with classical traditional turbulence, whereas new studies on\nQT are focused on a comparison between QT and classical turbulence. The second\nreason is the realization of atomic BECs in 1995, for which modern optical\ntechniques enable the direct control and visualization of the condensate and\ncan even change the interaction; such direct control is impossible in other\nquantum condensates like superfluid helium and superconductors.

We develop here a policy iteration algorithm for zero-sum\nstochastic games with mean payoff, following an idea of two of the authors\n(Cochet-Terrasson and Gaubert, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci.

The\nalgorithm relies on a notion of nonlinear spectral projection (Akian and\nGaubert, Nonlinear Analysis TMA, 2003), which is analogous to the notion of\nreduction of super-harmonic functions in linear potential theory. To avoid\ncycling, at each degenerate iteration (in which the mean payoff vector is not\nimproved), the new relative value is obtained by reducing the earlier one. We\nshow that the sequence of values and relative values satisfies a\nlexicographical monotonicity property, which implies that the algorithm does\nterminate. We illustrate the algorithm by a mean-payoff version of Richman\ngames (stochastic tug-of-war or discrete infinity Laplacian type equation), in\nwhich degenerate iterations are frequent. We report numerical experiments on\nlarge scale instances, arising from the latter games, as well as from monotone\ndiscretizations of a mean-payoff pursuit-evasion deterministic differential\ngame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 09:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-03"}

Praesepe is an\ninteresting open cluster for the study of the stellar and substellar mass\nfunction (MF), considering its intermediate age and its nearby distance. Here\nwe present the results of a wide field, near-infrared study of Praesepe using\nthe Data Release 9 (DR9) of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS)\nGalactic Clusters Survey (GCS). We obtained cluster candidates of Praesepe\nbased on a 3sigma astrometric and 5 band photometric selection. We derived a\nbinary frequency for Praesepe of 25.6+/-3.0% in the 0.2-0.45Msol mass range,\n19.6+/-3.0% for 0.1-0.2Msol, and 23.2+/-5.6% for 0.07-0.1Msol. We also studied\nthe variability of the cluster candidates of Praesepe and we conclude that\nseven objects could be variable. We inferred the luminosity function of\nPraesepe in the Z- and J- bands and derived its MF. We observe that our\ndetermination of the MF of Praesepe differs from previous studies: while\nprevious MFs present an increase from 0.6 to 0.1Msol, our MF shows a decrease.\nWe looked at the MF of Praesepe in two different regions of the cluster, i.e.\nwithin and beyond 1.25deg, and we observed that both regions present a MF which\ndecrease to lower masses. We compared our results with the Hyades, the Pleiades\nand alpha Per MF in the mass range of 0.072-0.6Msol and showed that the\nPraesepe MF is more similar to alpha Per although they are respectively aged\n~85 and ~600Myr.

The agreement with the CE\napproximation supplies an analytical formula that allows to develop kinetic\ntransport theory at fixed shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\\eta/s$.\nThis open the possibility to explore dissipative non-equilibrium evolution of\nthe distribution functions vs T-dependent $\\eta/s$ and particle momenta in the\ndynamics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 13:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 09:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

This is a simplifying assumption, because most organisms possess\ngenetic traits that affect their population structure to some degree. These\ntraits, such as a group size preference, affect the relatedness of interacting\nindividuals and hence the opportunity for kin or group selection. We argue that\nmodels that do not explicitly consider their evolution cannot provide a\nsatisfactory account of the origin of cooperation, because they cannot explain\nhow the prerequisite population structures arise. Here, we consider the\nconcurrent evolution of genetic traits that affect population structure, with\nthose that affect social behavior. We show that not only does population\nstructure drive social evolution, as in previous models, but that the\nopportunity for cooperation can in turn drive the creation of population\nstructures that support it. This occurs through the generation of linkage\ndisequilibrium between socio-behavioral and population-structuring traits, such\nthat direct kin selection on social behavior creates indirect selection\npressure on population structure. We illustrate our argument with a model of\nthe concurrent evolution of group size preference and social behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 13:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-03"}

Injecting spin-polarised electrons into a\nsuperconductor thus creates both spin and charge imbalances [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\n7] (respectively Q* and S*, cf. Ref. [4]). These must relax when the injection\nstops, but not necessarily over the same time (or length) scale as spin\nrelaxation requires spin-dependent interactions while charge relaxation does\nnot. These different relaxation times can be probed by creating a dynamic\nequilibrium between continuous injection and relaxation, which leads to\nconstant-in-time spin and charge imbalances. These scale with their respective\nrelaxation times and with the injection current. While charge imbalances in\nsuperconductors have been studied in great detail both theoretically [8] and\nexperimentally [9], spin imbalances have not received much experimental\nattention [6, 10] despite intriguing theoretical predictions of spin-charge\nseparation effects [11, 12].

The TRT consists of a barrel section at small pseudorapidity\n(eta) and two separate end-cap partitions at large eta. The detector\nperformance and its operational conditions were permanently monitored during\nall commissioning and data-taking stages using various software tools, one of\nwhich - TRTViewer - is described in the present paper. The TRTViewer is the\ndedicated program for monitoring the TRT raw data quality and detector\nperformance at different hardware levels: individual straws, readout chips and\nelectronic boards. The data analysis results can be presented on the\nevent-by-event basis or in the form of color maps representing the operation\nparameters (efficiencies, timing, occupancy, etc.) according to the real\ngeometrical position of the detector hardware elements. The paper describes the\nTRTViewer software package as the event displaying tool, raw data processor and\nhistogram and operation parameters presenter, which works with the different\nsources of input information: raw data files, online monitoring histograms,\noffline analysis histograms and TRT DAQ Configuration database. The package\nproved to be one of the main instruments for the fast and effective TRT\ndiagnostics during debugging and operation periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 14:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

In principle, individual selection could act on such parameters so\nas to strengthen the force of between-group selection and hence increase\ncooperation and individual fitness, as illustrated in our previous work.\nHowever, such a process cannot operate in parameter regions where group\nselection effects are totally absent, since there would be no selective\ngradient to follow. One key parameter, which when increased often rapidly\ncauses group selection effects to tend to zero, is initial group size, for when\ngroups are formed randomly then even moderately sized groups lack significant\nvariance in their composition. However, the consequent restriction of any group\nselection effect to small sized groups is derived from models that assume\nselfish types will competitively exclude their more cooperative counterparts at\nwithin-group equilibrium. In such cases, diversity in the migrant pool can tend\nto zero and accordingly variance in group composition cannot be generated. In\ncontrast, we show that if within-group dynamics lead to a stable coexistence of\nselfish and cooperative types, then the range of group sizes showing some\neffect of group selection is much larger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 15:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-03"}

The observed\nratio of 16O/18O for RCB stars is in the range of 0.3-20 much smaller than the\nsolar value of ~500. In this paper, we investigate whether such a low ratio can\nbe obtained in simulations of the merger of a CO and a He white dwarf. We\npresent the results of five 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the\nmerger of a double white dwarf system where the total mass is 0.9 Mdot and the\ninitial mass ratio (q) varies between 0.5 and 0.99. We identify in simulations\nwith $q\\lesssim0.7$ a feature around the merged stars where the temperatures\nand densities are suitable for forming 18O. However, more 16O is being\ndredged-up from the C- and O-rich accretor during the merger than the amount of\n18O that is produced. Therefore, on a dynamical time scale over which our\nhydrodynamics simulation runs, a 16O/18O ratio of ~2000 in the \"best\" case is\nfound. If the conditions found in the hydrodynamic simulations persist for 10^6\nseconds the oxygen ratio drops to 16 in one case studied, while in a hundred\nyears it drops to ~4 in another case studied, consistent with the observed\nvalues in RCB stars. Therefore, the merger of two white dwarfs remains a strong\ncandidate for the formation of these enigmatic stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 15:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Rev. Lett. 106 130401) devoted to the study of the instability of the\nsuperfluid flow of a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate in presence of a\nrepulsive optical barrier. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field equation, we\nobserve, consistently with what we found in Piazza et al (2009 Phys. Rev. A 80\n021601), that the superflow with one unit of angular momentum becomes unstable\nat a critical strength of the barrier, and decays through the mechanism of\nphase slippage performed by pairs of vortex-antivortex lines annihilating.\nWhile this picture qualitatively agrees with the experimental findings, the\nmeasured critical barrier height is not very well reproduced by the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, indicating that thermal fluctuations can play an\nimportant role (Mathey et al 2012 arXiv:1207.0501). As an alternative\nexplanation of the discrepancy, we consider the effect of the finite resolution\nof the imaging system. At the critical point, the superfluid velocity in the\nvicinity of the obstacle is always of the order of the sound speed in that\nregion, $v_{\\rm barr}=c_{\\rm l}$. In particular, in the hydrodynamic regime\n(not reached in the above experiment), the critical point is determined by\napplying the Landau criterion inside the barrier region. On the other hand, the\nFeynman critical velocity $v_{\\rm f}$ is much lower than the observed critical\nvelocity. We argue that this is a general feature of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation, where we have $v_{\\rm f}=\\epsilon\\ c_{\\rm l}$ with $\\epsilon$ being a\nsmall parameter of the model.
