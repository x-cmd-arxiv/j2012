This\ncomposite state differs from the SM for three main reasons. Its decay constant\nis in general larger than the electroweak scale, hence suppressing all the\ncouplings to standard model particles with respect to an elementary Higgs\nboson, with the exception of the coupling to photons and gluons, which is\nexpected to be larger than the standard-model equivalent.\n  We discuss three classes of questions. Is it possible to lower the decay\nconstant, by changing the geometry of the holographic model? Is it possible to\nlower the overall scale of the strong dynamics, by modifying the way in which\nelectroweak symmetry breaking is implemented in the holographic model? Is there\na clear indication in the data that production mechanisms other than\ngluon-gluon fusion have been observed, disfavoring models in which the\nholographic techni-dilaton has a large decay constant?\n  We show that all of these questions are still open, given the present status\nof theoretical as well as phenomenological studies, and that at present the\ntechni-dilaton hypothesis yields a fit to the data which is either as good as\nthe elementary Higgs hypothesis, or marginally better, depending on what sets\nof data are used in the fit. We identify clear strategies for future work aimed\nat addressing these three classes of open questions.\n  In the process, we also compute the complete scalar spectrum of the\ntwo-scalar truncation describing the GPPZ model, as well as the decay constant\nof the holographic techni-dilaton in this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 17:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 06:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In the transverse region, both the multiplicity and the scalar sum of\nthe transverse momentum at fixed pT^JET vary significantly with R, while the\naverage charged-particle transverse momentum has a minimal dependence on R.\nPredictions from several Monte Carlo tunes have been compared to the data; the\npredictions from Pythia 6, based on tunes that have been determined using LHC\ndata, show reasonable agreement with the data, including the dependence on R.\nComparisons with other generators indicate that additional tuning of soft-QCD\nparameters is necessary for these generators.

In this paper, we present the first\ncomprehensive analysis of optical-optical and optical-NIR colours, as a\nfunction of galaxy mass, out to the halo region (8Re) of early-type galaxies\n(ETGs). We select a sample of 674 massive ETGs (M*>3x10^10MSun) from the\nSDSS-based SPIDER survey. By comparing with a large range of population\nsynthesis models, we derive robust constraints on the radial trends in age and\nmetallicity. Metallicity is unambiguously found to decrease outwards, with a\nmeasurable steepening of the slope in the outer regions (Re<R<8Re). The\ngradients in stellar age are found to be more sensitive to the models used, but\nin general, the outer regions of ETGs feature older populations compared to the\ncores. This trend is strongest for the most massive galaxies in our sample\n(M*>10^11MSun). Furthermore, when segregating with respect to large scale\nenvironment, the age gradient is more significant in ETGs residing in higher\ndensity regions. These results shed light on the processes leading from the\nformation of the central core to the growth of the stellar envelope of massive\ngalaxies. The fact that the populations in the outer regions are older and more\nmetal-poor than in the core suggests a process whereby the envelope of massive\ngalaxies is made up of accreted small satellites (i.e. minor mergers) whose\nstars were born during the first stages of galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 19:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We derive\na two-selection colour criterion from this sample of log(F70/F500)\\geq 1 and\nlog(F160/F350)\\geq 1.6 to identify an additional 31 embedded massive star\ncandidates with no associated star-formation tracers. Using this result we can\nbuild a picture of the present day star-formation of the complex, and by\nextrapolating an initial mass function, suggest a current population of \\approx\n2 \\times 10^4 young stellar objects (YSOs) present, corresponding to a star\nformation rate (SFR) of 0.01-0.02 M\\odot yr^-1. Comparing this resolved star\nformation rate, to extragalactic star formation rate tracers (based on the\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation), we find the star formation activity is\nunderestimated by a factor of \\geq 2 in comparison to the SFR derived from the\nYSO population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The R-band magnitude of J1432+3358 is 22.29 AB, more than\ntwo magnitudes brighter than typical L* LBGs at this redshift.

Furthermore in the high-beta solar wind plasma\nwhistler waves meet the Landau resonance with electrons for velocities less\nthan the thermal speed, and consequently the electric force is small compared\nto the mirror force. As whistlers propagate through the inhomogeneous solar\nwind, the perpendicular wave number increases through refraction, increasing\nthe Landau damping rate. However, the whistlers can survive because the\nbackground kinetic Alfven wave turbulence creates a plateau by quasilinear\ndiffusion in the solar wind electron distribution at small velocities. It is\nfound that for whistler energy density of only ~10^-3 that of the kinetic\nAlfven waves, the quasilinear diffusion rate due to whistlers is comparable to\nKAW.

We found that altitude, dispersal events and\nadmixture among subspecies formed a complex hierarchical genetic structure\nwithin teosinte. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium revealed four mega-base\nscale inversions that segregated among populations and had altitudinal clines.\nBased on patterns of differentiation and correlation with environmental\nvariation, inversions and nongenic regions play an important role in local\nadaptation of teosinte. Further, we note that strongly differentiated\nindividual populations can bias the identification of adaptive loci. The role\nof inversions in local adaptation has been predicted by theory and requires\nattention as genome-wide data become available for additional plant species.\nThese results also suggest a potentially important role for noncoding\nvariation, especially in large plant genomes in which the gene space represents\na fraction of the entire genome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 00:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-01"}

In this paper, we investigate five coronal eruptions originating\nfrom four sigmoidal active regions, using high-cadence, high-resolution\nnarrowband EUV images obtained by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO}). The\nmagnitudes of the flares associated with the eruptions range from the\nGOES-class B to X. Owing to the high-sensitivity and broad temperature coverage\nof the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO, we are able to identify\nboth the contracting and erupting components of the eruptions: the former is\nobserved in cold AIA channels as the contracting coronal loops overlying the\nelbows of the sigmoid, and the latter is preferentially observed in warm/hot\nAIA channels as an expanding bubble originating from the center of the sigmoid.\nThe initiation of eruption always precedes the contraction, and in the\nenergetically mild events (B and C flares), it also precedes the increase in\nGOES soft X-ray fluxes. In the more energetic events, the eruption is\nsimultaneous with the impulsive phase of the nonthermal hard X-ray emission.\nThese observations confirm the loop contraction as an integrated process in\neruptions with partially opened arcades. The consequence of contraction is a\nnew equilibrium with reduced magnetic energy, as the contracting loops never\nregain their original positions. The contracting process is a direct\nconsequence of flare energy release, as evidenced by the strong correlation of\nthe maximal contracting speed, and strong anti-correlation of the time delay of\ncontraction relative to expansion, with the peak soft X-ray flux. This is also\nimplied by the relationship between contraction and expansion, i.e., their\ntiming and speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 01:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We then propagate these residuals into two\nmetrics of interest for 21cm EoR experiments - the angular and two-dimensional\npower spectrum - using a combination of full analytic covariant derivation,\nanalytic variant derivation, and covariant Monte Carlo simulations. This\nmethodology differs from previous work in two ways: (1) it uses information\ntheory to set the point source position error, rather than assuming a global\nroot-mean-square error, and (2) it describes a method for propagating the\nerrors analytically, thereby obtaining the full correlation structure of the\npower spectra.

In many cases, the signal sparsity\nand the recovery performance can be further improved by replacing the L1 norm\nwith a \"weighted\" L1 norm. Without any prior information about nonzero elements\nof the signal, the procedure for selecting weights is iterative in nature.\nCommon approaches update the weights at every iteration using the solution of a\nweighted L1 problem from the previous iteration.\n  In this paper, we present two homotopy-based algorithms that efficiently\nsolve reweighted L1 problems. First, we present an algorithm that quickly\nupdates the solution of a weighted L1 problem as the weights change. Since the\nsolution changes only slightly with small changes in the weights, we develop a\nhomotopy algorithm that replaces the old weights with the new ones in a small\nnumber of computationally inexpensive steps. Second, we propose an algorithm\nthat solves a weighted L1 problem by adaptively selecting the weights while\nestimating the signal. This algorithm integrates the reweighting into every\nstep along the homotopy path by changing the weights according to the changes\nin the solution and its support, allowing us to achieve a high quality signal\nreconstruction by solving a single homotopy problem. We compare the performance\nof both algorithms, in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational\ncomplexity, against state-of-the-art solvers and show that our methods have\nsmaller computational cost.

Many solutions to this problem\nhave been proposed, including restricting the type of weights used and\nemploying a different valuation function that forces convergence. In this paper\nwe describe an alternative approach that, rather than seeking to avoid the\ninevitable divergences, instead embraces them as a source of useful\ninformation. Specifically, rather than taking coefficients from an arbitrary\nsemiring S we instead take them from S^N. Doing this is useful because it gives\nus information about how the weight of an infinite word does or does not\ndiverge, and if it does diverge what form the divergence takes --- e.g.,\npolynomial, exponential, etc. This approach has proved to be incredibly useful\nin the field of quantum simulation because when studying infinite systems,\ninformation about how quantities of interest, such as energy or magnetization,\ndiverge is exactly what we want.\n  In this paper we introduce a new kind of automaton which we call a diverging\nautomaton that maps infinite words to sequences of weights from a semiring and\nwhich employs a Buchi-like boundary condition. We then develop a theory for\ndiverging power series and prove a Kleene Theorem connecting rational diverging\npower series to diverging automata. Afterward we repeat this process by\nintroducing bidiverging automata which map biinfinite words to elements in S^(Z\nx N), developing a theory for bidiverging power series, and proving another\nKleene Theorem.

The rapidity divergence is handled by\nintroducing the $\\delta$ regulator in the collinear Wilson lines. The collinear\npart, which consists of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution\nfunction (TMDPDF), is free of the rapidity divergence after the soft zero-bin\nsubtraction. There still remains the problem of mixing between the ultraviolet\nand infrared divergences, which forbids the renormalization group description.\nWe show that the mixing is cancelled by the soft function.

Both the 13CO and C18O lines\nexhibit two well separated velocity components at about 1.3 and 8.7 km/s. The\nemission of both CO isotopologues is more widely distributed than the\nsubmillimetre dust continuum emission as probed by LABOCA. The LABOCA\n870-micron peak position of SMM 3 is devoid of strong CO isotopologue emission,\nwhich is consistent with our earlier detection of strong CO depletion in the\nsource. No signatures of a large-scale outflow were found towards SMM 3. The\n13CO and C18O emission seen at ~1.3 km/s is concentrated into a single\nclump-like feature at the eastern part of the map. The peak H2 column density\ntowards a C18O maximum of the low-velocity component is estimated to be ~10^22\ncm-2. A velocity gradient was found across both the 13CO and C18O maps.\nInterestingly, SMM 3 lies on the border of this velocity gradient. The 13CO and\nC18O emission at ~1.3 km/s is likely to originate from the \"low-velocity part\"\nof Orion B. Our analysis suggests that it contains high density gas, which\nconforms to our earlier detection of deuterated species at similarly low radial\nvelocities. The sharp velocity gradient in the region might represent a shock\nfront resulting from the feedback from the nearby expanding HII region NGC\n2024.

The complex conductivity\nand hence the frequency dependence of the experimentally measured forward\nscattering parameter $S_{21}$ of the SR as a function of $P_{abs}$ were found.\nThe non-equilibrium $S_{21}$ cannot be accurately modeled by a thermal\ndistribution at an elevated temperature $T_{21}^*$ having a higher\nquality-factor in all cases studied and for low $P_{abs}$ $T_{21}^*\\sim T_N^*$.\n  Using $\\tau_r$ and $N_{qp}$ we determined the achievable Noise Equivalent\nPower of the resonator used as a detector as a function of $P_{abs}$. Simpler\nexpressions for $T_N^*$ as a function of $P_{abs}$ were derived which give a\nvery good account of $T_N^*$ and also $N_{qp}$ and $\\tau_r$. We conclude that\nmultiple photon absorption from the probe increases the quasiparticle number\nabove the thermal background and ultimately limits the achievable NEP of the\nresonator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 08:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In this paper\nwe present a general discussion of the constraints of the renormalization group\n(RG) invariance on the choice of the renormalization scale. We adopt the RG\nbased equations, which incorporate the scheme parameters, for a general\nexposition of RG invariance, since they simultaneously express the invariance\nof physical observables under both the variation of the renormalization scale\nand the renormalization scheme parameters. We then discuss the self-consistency\nrequirements of the RG, such as reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, which\nmust be satisfied by the scale-setting method. The Principle of Minimal\nSensitivity (PMS) requires the slope of the approximant of an observable to\nvanish at the renormalization point. This criterion provides a\nscheme-independent estimation, but it violates the symmetry and transitivity\nproperties of the RG and does not reproduce the Gell-Mann-Low scale for QED\nobservables.

We\nreport four faint T-dwarf candidates in the direction of the Serpens Core with\nCH4_on-CH4_off above 0.2 mag, estimated visual extinction in the range 1-9 mag\nand spectral type in the range T1-T5 based on their dereddened CH4_on-CH4_off\ncolors.

The properties of the other two candidates (ID3 and 4)\nare consistent with them being young members of the Serpens Core cluster,\nalthough our analysis can not be considered conclusive. In particular, ID3 may\nalso be a foreground T-dwarf. It is detected by the Spitzer c2d survey but only\nflux upper limits are available above 5.8 microns and, hence, we can not assess\nthe presence of a possible disk around this object.

However, this potential cannot be realised\nwithout a quantitative model for the QPO. We have recently shown that the same\ntruncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which is used to interpret the spectral\ntransitions can also directly produce the QPO from Lense-Thirring (vertical)\nprecession of the hot inner flow. This correctly predicts both the frequency\nand spectrum of the QPO, and the tight correlation of these properties with the\ntotal spectrum of the source via a changing truncation radius between the disc\nand hot flow. This model predicts a unique iron line signature as a vertically\ntilted flow illuminates different azimuths of the disc as it precesses. The\niron line arising from this rotating illumination is blue shifted when the flow\nirradiates the approaching region of the spinning disc and red shifted when the\nflow irradiates the receding region of the disc. This gives rise to a\ncharacteristic rocking of the iron line on the QPO frequency which is a\nnecessary (and probably sufficient) test of a Lense-Thirring origin. This is\nalso an independent test of disc truncation models for the low/hard state, as\nvertical precession cannot occur if there is a disc in the midplane.\n  We show that it may be possible to observe this effect using archival data\nfrom the Rossi X-ray timing explorer (RXTE) or XMM Newton. However, a clean\ntest requires a combination of moderate resolution and good statistics, such as\nwould be available from a long XMM-Newton observation or with data from the\nproposed ESA mission LOFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 12:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The method is based on the efficient coupling of different\nspatial resolution levels, taking advantage of the low sampling cost in a\ncoarse space and by developing local reconstruction strategies from\ncoarse-grained dynamics. Microscopic reconstruction corrects possibly\nsignificant errors introduced through coarse-graining, leading to the\ncontrolled-error approximation of the sampled stochastic process. In this\nmanner, the proposed multi-level algorithm overcomes known shortcomings of\ncoarse-graining of particle systems with complex interactions such as combined\nlong and short-range particle interactions and/or complex lattice geometries.\n  Specifically, we provide error analysis for the approximation of long-time\nstationary dynamics in terms of relative entropy and prove that information\nloss in the multi-level methods is growing linearly in time, which in turn\nimplies that an appropriate observable in the stationary regime is the\ninformation loss of the path measures per unit time. We show that this\nobservable can be either estimated a priori, or it can be tracked\ncomputationally a posteriori in the course of a simulation. The stationary\nregime is of critical importance to molecular simulations as it is relevant to\nlong-time sampling, obtaining phase diagrams and in studying metastability\nproperties of high-dimensional complex systems. Finally, the multi-level nature\nof the method provides flexibility in combining rejection-free and null-event\nimplementations, generating a hierarchy of algorithms with an adjustable number\nof rejections that includes well-known rejection-free and null-event\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 12:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-06"}

We find\nthat if the size of the neighbourhood is less than five, complete\nclassification of all rules is possible. Among 5-site rules, those with von\nNeuman neighbourhoods as well as neighbourhoods corresponding to T, V, and Z\npentominos can also be completely classified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2012 15:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-06"}

Such loop prediction challenges, which arise frequently in\ncomparative modeling and protein design, can become intractable as loop lengths\nexceed 10 residues and if surrounding side-chain conformations are erased. This\narticle introduces a modeling strategy based on a 'stepwise ansatz', recently\ndeveloped for RNA modeling, which posits that any realistic all-atom molecular\nconformation can be built up by residue-by-residue stepwise enumeration. When\nharnessed to a dynamic-programming-like recursion in the Rosetta framework, the\nresulting stepwise assembly (SWA) protocol enables enumerative sampling of a 12\nresidue loop at a significant but achievable cost of thousands of CPU-hours. In\na previously established benchmark, SWA recovers crystallographic conformations\nwith sub-Angstrom accuracy for 19 of 20 loops, compared to 14 of 20 by KIC\nmodeling with a comparable expenditure of computational power. Furthermore, SWA\ngives high accuracy results on an additional set of 15 loops highlighted in the\nbiological literature for their irregularity or unusual length. Successes\ninclude cis-Pro touch turns, loops that pass through tunnels of other\nside-chains, and loops of lengths up to 24 residues. Remaining problem cases\nare traced to inaccuracies in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. In five\nadditional blind tests, SWA achieves sub-Angstrom accuracy models, including\nthe first such success in a protein/RNA binding interface, the YbxF/kink-turn\ninteraction in the fourth RNA-puzzle competition. These results establish\nall-atom enumeration as a systematic approach to protein structure that can\nleverage high performance computing and physically realistic energy functions\nto more consistently achieve atomic resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 19:06:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2013 15:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}
