Our primary sample consists of old elliptical galaxies selected\nfrom the ACS Virgo and Fornax surveys. To improve statistics at both the lowest\nand highest X-ray luminosity, we also use previously reported results from\nother galaxies. It is well known that the LMXB fraction is considerably higher\nin red, metal-rich, than in blue, metal-poor GCs. In this paper, we test\nwhether this metallicity effect is X-ray luminosity-dependent, and find that\nthe effect holds uniformly in a wide luminosity range. This result is\nstatistically significant (at >= 3 sigma) in LMXBs with luminosities in the\nrange LX = 2 x 10^37 - 5 x 10^38 erg s-1, where the ratio of LMXB fractions in\nmetal-rich to metal-poor GCs is R = 3.4 +- 0.5. A similar ratio is also found\nat lower (down to 10^36 erg s-1) and higher luminosities (up to the ULX\nregime), but with less significance (~2 sigma confidence). Because different\ntypes of LMXBs dominate in different luminosities, our finding requires a new\nexplanation for the metallicity effect in dynamically formed LMXBs. We confirm\nthat the metallicity effect is not affected by other factors such as stellar\nage, GC mass, stellar encounter rate, and galacto-centric distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 16:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 19:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

It is also known\nthat genealogical trees for populations under selection are quantifiably\ndifferent from those expected under neutral evolution and described\nstatistically by Kingman's coalescent. While differences in the statistical\nstructure of genealogies have long been used as a test for the presence of\nselection, the full extent of the information that they contain has not been\nexploited. Here we shall demonstrate that the shape of the reconstructed\ngenealogical tree for a moderately large number of random genomic samples taken\nfrom a fitness diverse, but otherwise unstructured asexual population can be\nused to predict the relative fitness of individuals within the sample. To\nachieve this we define a heuristic algorithm, which we test in silico using\nsimulations of a Wright-Fisher model for a realistic range of mutation rates\nand selection strength. Our inferred fitness ranking is based on a linear\ndiscriminator which identifies rapidly coalescing lineages in the reconstructed\ntree. Inferred fitness ranking correlates strongly with actual fitness, with a\ngenome in the top 10% ranked being in the top 20% fittest with false discovery\nrate of 0.1-0.3 depending on the mutation/selection parameters. The ranking\nalso enables to predict the genotypes that future populations inherit from the\npresent one. While the inference accuracy increases monotonically with sample\nsize, samples of 200 nearly saturate the performance. We propose that our\napproach can be used for inferring relative fitness of genomes obtained in\nsingle-cell sequencing of tumors and in monitoring viral outbreaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 16:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2013 00:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-04"}

Red\ngiants serve as seeds for the dynamical production of bright LMXBs via two\nchannels - binary exchanges and physical collisions - and the increase of the\nnumber densities and masses of red giants boost LMXB production, leading to the\nobserved difference.

Pre-stellar cores provide the original reservoir of\nmaterial from which future planetary systems are built, but few observational\nconstraints exist on the formation of water and its partitioning between gas\nand ice in the densest cores. Thanks to the high sensitivity of the Herschel\nSpace Observatory, we report on the first detection of water vapor at high\nspectral resolution toward a dense cloud on the verge of star formation, the\npre-stellar core L1544. The line shows an inverse P-Cygni profile,\ncharacteristic of gravitational contraction. To reproduce the observations,\nwater vapor has to be present in the cold and dense central few thousand AU of\nL1544, where species heavier than Helium are expected to freeze-out onto dust\ngrains, and the ortho:para H2 ratio has to be around 1:1 or larger. The\nobserved amount of water vapor within the core (about 1.5x10^{-6} Msun) can be\nmaintained by Far-UV photons locally produced by the impact of galactic cosmic\nrays with H2 molecules. Such FUV photons irradiate the icy mantles, liberating\nwater wapor in the core center. Our Herschel data, combined with radiative\ntransfer and chemical/dynamical models, shed light on the interplay between gas\nand solids in dense interstellar clouds and provide the first measurement of\nthe water vapor abundance profile across the parent cloud of a future\nsolar-type star and its potential planetary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 19:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Our blind analysis is designed to\nprevent experimenter bias. The joint analysis of the data sets allows a\ntime-delay distance measurement to 6% precision that takes into account all\nknown systematic uncertainties.

The first introduces the\nNewton complementary dual of a rational map. One main result is that this dual\npreserves birationality and gives an involutional map of the Cremona group to\nitself that restricts to the monomial Cremona subgroup and preserves de\nJonqui\\`eres maps. In the monomial restriction this duality commutes with\ntaking inverse in the group, but is a not a group homomorphism. The second\nconstruction is an iterative process to obtain rational maps in increasing\ndimension. Starting with birational maps, it leads to rational maps whose\ntopological degree is under control. Making use of monoids, the resulting\nconstruct is in fact birational if the original map is so. A variation of this\nidea is considered in order to preserve properties of the base ideal, such as\nCohen--Macaulayness. Combining the two methods, one is able to produce explicit\ninfinite families of Cohen--Macaulay Cremona maps with prescribed dimension,\ncodimension and degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 21:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-31"}

Using a simple method, we\ncompute absorption line profiles against a continuum point source for several\nsimulations of accretion disk winds. We investigate the geometrical,\nionization, and dynamical effects on the absorption line shapes. We find that\nsignificant complexity and diversity of the absorption line profile shapes can\nbe produced by the non-monotonic distribution of the wind velocity, density,\nand ionization state. Non-monotonic distributions of such quantities are\npresent even in steady-state, smooth disk winds, and naturally lead to the\nformation of multiple and detached absorption troughs. These results\ndemonstrate that the part of a wind where an absorption line is formed is not\nrepresentative of the entire wind. Thus, the information contained in the\nabsorption line is incomplete if not even insufficient to well estimate gross\nproperties of the wind such as the total mass and energy fluxes. In addition,\nthe highly dynamical nature of certain portions of disk winds can have\nimportant effects on the estimates of the wind properties.

Recent studies with simplified models have identified two advantages\nof coupling fast and slow feedback loops. Namely, this dual-time structure\nenables a fast response while enhancing resistances of responses and\nbistability to stimulus noise. We now find that in addition: 1) the dual-time\nstructure confers resistance to internal noise due to molecule number\nfluctuations, and 2) model variants with altered coupling, which better\nrepresent some specific systems, share all the above advantages. We develop a\nsimilar bistable model with a fast autoactivation loop coupled to a slow loop,\nwhich minimally represents positive feedback that may be essential for\nlong-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). The advantages of fast response and\nnoise resistance carry over to this model. Empirically, LTP develops resistance\nto reversal over ~1 h. The model suggests this resistance may result from\nincreased amounts of synaptic kinases involved in positive feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 23:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-31"}

Initially, k pieces of information (henceforth called tokens) are\ndistributed among n nodes. The tokens need to be broadcast to all nodes through\na synchronous network in which the topology can change arbitrarily from round\nto round provided that some connectivity requirements are satisfied.\n  If the network is guaranteed to be connected in every round and each node can\nbroadcast a single token per round to its neighbors, there is a simple token\ndissemination algorithm that manages to deliver all k tokens to all the nodes\nin O(nk) rounds. Interestingly, in a recent paper, Dutta et al. proved an\nalmost matching Omega(n + nk/log n) lower bound for deterministic\ntoken-forwarding algorithms that are not allowed to combine, split, or change\ntokens in any way. In the present paper, we extend this bound in different\nways.\n  If nodes are allowed to forward b < k tokens instead of only one token in\nevery round, a straight-forward extension of the O(nk) algorithm disseminates\nall k tokens in time O(nk/b). We show that for any randomized token-forwarding\nalgorithm, Omega(n + nk/(b^2 log n log log n)) rounds are necessary. If nodes\ncan only send a single token per round, but we are guaranteed that the network\ngraph is c-vertex connected in every round, we show a lower bound of\nOmega(nk/(c log^{3/2} n)), which almost matches the currently best O(nk/c)\nupper bound. Further, if the network is T-interval connected, a notion that\ncaptures connection stability over time, we prove that Omega(n + nk/(T^2 log\nn)) rounds are needed. The best known upper bound in this case manages to solve\nthe problem in O(n + nk/T) rounds. Finally, we show that even if each node only\nneeds to obtain a delta-fraction of all the tokens for some delta in [0,1],\nOmega(nk delta^3 log n) are still required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 23:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-31"}

Subjects then performed a\ngoal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the\nKMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops\nat designated points within the VRE.\n  Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was\n77.2 +/- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10^-23),\nwith chance performance being 50%.

These few driver alterations reside in a cancer\ngenome alongside tens of thousands of other mutations that are widely believed\nto have no role in cancer and termed passengers. Many passengers, however, fall\nwithin protein coding genes and other functional elements and can possibly have\ndeleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate a potential of mildly\ndeleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic\nprogression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer\nprogression with the analysis of cancer sequencing data. In our simulations,\nindividual cells stochastically divide, acquire advantageous driver and\ndeleterious passenger mutations, or die. Surprisingly, despite selection\nagainst them, passengers accumulate and largely evade selection during\nprogression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers\nalters the course of progression leading to several phenomena observed in\noncology that cannot be explained by a traditional driver-centric view. We\ntested predictions of the model using cancer genomic data. We find that many\npassenger mutations are likely to be damaging and that, in agreement with the\nmodel, they have largely evaded purifying selection. Finally, we used our model\nto explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either 1)\nincreasing the mutation rate; or 2) exacerbating their deleterious effects.\nWhile both approaches lead to cancer regression, the later leads to less\nfrequent relapse. Our results suggest a new framework for understanding cancer\nprogression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 03:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The UBVRI light curves\ndemonstrated an interesting two-stage evolution during the nebular phase, which\nalmost flatten out after about 90 days from the optical maximum. SN 2010jl has\none of the highest intrinsic H_alpha luminosity ever recorded for a SN IIn,\nespecially at late phase, suggesting a strong interaction of SN ejecta with the\ndense circumstellar material (CSM) ejected by the progenitor. This is also\nindicated by the remarkably strong Balmer lines persisting in the optical\nspectra. One interesting spectral evolution about SN 2010jl is the appearance\nof asymmetry of the Balmer lines. These lines can be well decomposed into a\nnarrow component and an intermediate-width component. The intermediate-width\ncomponent showed a steady increase in both strength and blueshift with time\nuntil t ~ 400 days after maximum, but it became less blueshifted at t ~ 500\ndays when the line profile appeared relatively symmetric again. Owing to that a\npure reddening effect will lead to a sudden decline of the light curves and a\nprogressive blueshift of the spectral lines, we therefore propose that the\nasymmetric profiles of H lines seen in SN 2010jl is unlikely due to the\nextinction by newly formed dust inside the ejecta, contrary to the explanation\nby some early studies. Based on a simple CSM-interaction model, we speculate\nthat the progenitor of SN 2010jl may suffer a gigantic mass loss (~ 30-50\nM_sun) in a few decades before explosion. Considering a slow moving stellar\nwind (e.g., ~ 28 km/s) inferred for the preexisting, dense CSM shell and the\nextremely high mass-loss rate (1-2 M_sun per yr), we suggest that the\nprogenitor of SN 2010jl might have experienced a red supergiant stage and\nexplode finally as a post-red supergiant star with an initial mass above 30-40\nM_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 04:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Previous dynamo models suggest that\nsolutions become multipolar once inertia becomes influential. Being tailored\nfor terrestrial planets, most of these models neglected the background density\nstratification. Aims: we investigate the influence of the density\nstratification on convection-driven dynamo models. Methods: three-dimensional\nnonlinear simulations of rapidly rotating spherical shells are employed using\nthe anelastic approximation to incorporate density stratification. A systematic\nparametric study for various density stratifications and Rayleigh numbers\nallows to explore the dependence of the magnetic field topology on these\nparameters. Results: anelastic dynamo models tend to produce a broad range of\nmagnetic field geometries that fall on two distinct branches with either strong\ndipole-dominated or weak multipolar fields. As long as inertia is weak, both\nbranches can coexist but the dipolar branch vanishes once inertia becomes\ninfluential. The dipolar branch also vanishes for stronger density\nstratifications. The reason is the concentration of the convective columns in a\nnarrow region close to the outer boundary equator, a configuration that favors\nnon-axisymmetric solutions. In multipolar solutions, zonal flows can become\nsignificant and participate in the toroidal field generation. Parker dynamo\nwaves may then play an important role close to onset of dynamo action leading\nto a cyclic magnetic field behavior. Conclusion: Our simulations also suggest\nthat the fact that late M dwarfs have dipolar or multipolar magnetic fields can\nbe explained in two ways. They may differ either by the relative influence of\ninertia or fall into the regime where both types of solutions coexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 07:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Focusing on this\nscenario, this paper introduces the cycle consistency matrix (CCM) as a\npowerful analytical tool for characterizing and avoiding absorbing sets in\nseparable circulant-based (SCB) LDPC codes. SCB codes include a wide variety of\nregular LDPC codes such as array-based LDPC codes as well as many common\nquasi-cyclic codes. As a consequence of its cycle structure, each potential\nabsorbing set in an SCB LDPC code has a CCM, and an absorbing set can be\npresent in an SCB LDPC code only if the associated CCM has a nontrivial null\nspace.\n  CCM-based analysis can determine the multiplicity of an absorbing set in an\nSCB code and CCM-based constructions avoid certain small absorbing sets\ncompletely. While these techniques can be applied to an SCB code of any rate,\nlower-rate SCB codes can usually avoid small absorbing sets because of their\nhigher variable node degree.

There are a number of situations\nsuch as high applied voltages, high concentration of electrolytes, systems with\nmultivalent ions, or solvent-free ionic liquids where the classical theory is\noften applied but the fundamental assumptions cannot be justified. Perhaps the\nmost basic assumption underlying continuum models in electrokinetics is the\nmean-field approximation, that the electric field acting on each discrete ion\nis self-consistently determined by the local mean charge density. This paper\nconsiders situations where the mean-field approximation breaks down and\nelectrostatic correlations become important. A fourth-order modified Poisson\nequation is developed that accounts for electrostatic correlations and captures\nthe essential features in a simple continuum framework. The theory is derived\nvariationally as a gradient approximation for non-local electrostatics, in\nwhich the dielectric permittivity becomes a differential operator. The only new\nparameter is a characteristic length scale for correlated ion pairs. The model\nis able to capture subtle aspects of more detailed simulations based on Monte\nCarlo, molecular dynamics, or density functional theory and allows for the\nstraightforward calculation of electrokinetic flows in correlated liquids, for\nthe first time. Departures from classical Helmholtz-Smoluchowski theory are\ncontrolled by the dimensionless ratio of the correlation length to the Debye\nscreening length. Charge-density oscillations tend to reduce electro-osmotic\nflow and streaming current, and over-screening of the surface charge can lead\nto flow reversal. These effects also help to explain the apparent\ncharge-induced thickening of double layers in induced-charge electrokinetic\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 07:27:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 23:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We\nused a Molecular Dynamics (MD) inspired model, similar to discrete element\nmethod (DEM), that is suitable to model granular material and to observe the\ntrajectory of single particle, so to identify its dynamical properties. We\nconsider that the triggering of shallow landslides is caused by the decrease of\nthe static friction along the sliding surface due to water infiltration by\nrainfall. Thence the triggering is caused by two following conditions: (a) a\nthreshold speed of the particles and (b) a condition on the static friction,\nbetween particles and slope surface, based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure\ncriterion. The latter static condition is used in the geotechnical model to\nestimate the possibility of landslide triggering. Finally the interaction force\nbetween particles is defined trough a potential that, in the absence of\nexperimental data, we have modeled as the Lennard-Jones 2-1 potential. In the\nmodel the viscosity is also introduced and for a large range of values of the\nmodel's parameters, we observe a characteristic velocity pattern, with\nacceleration increments, typical of real landslides. The results of simulations\nare quite promising: the energy and the time triggering distributions of local\navalanches shows a power law distribution, analogous to the observed\nGutenberg-Richter and Omori power law distributions for earthquakes.

Much important\nresearch has been invested in decreasing the number of collisions in order to\nobtain faster algorithms for communication in such networks.\n  This paper proposes a novel approach for wireless communication, which\nembraces collisions rather than avoiding them, over an additive channel. It\nintroduces a coding technique called Bounded-Contention Coding (BCC) that\nallows collisions to be successfully decoded by the receiving nodes into the\noriginal transmissions and whose complexity depends on a bound on the\ncontention among the transmitters.\n  BCC enables deterministic local broadcast in a network with n nodes and at\nmost a transmitters with information of l bits each within O(a log n + al) bits\nof communication with full-duplex radios, and O((a log n + al)(log n)) bits,\nwith high probability, with half-duplex radios. When combined with random\nlinear network coding, BCC gives global broadcast within O((D + a + log n)(a\nlog n + l)) bits, with high probability. This also holds in dynamic networks\nthat can change arbitrarily over time by a worst-case adversary. When no bound\non the contention is given, it is shown how to probabilistically estimate it\nand obtain global broadcast that is adaptive to the true contention in the\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 10:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-31"}

Most observational studies so far point towards brown dwarfs sharing\na similar formation mechanism as the one accepted for low mass stars.

In this second paper of a series devoted to\nthe study of the spectroscopic properties of the members of the Lambda Orionis\nStar Forming Region, we study accretion, activity and rotation for a wide set\nof spectroscopically confirmed members of the central star cluster Collinder 69\nto draw analogies and/or differences between the brown dwarf and stellar\npopulations of this cluster. Moreover, we present comparisons with other star\nforming regions of similar and different ages to address environmental effects\non our conclusions. Methods. We study prominent photospheric lines to derive\nrotational velocities and emission lines to distinguish between accretion\nprocesses and chromospheric activity. In addition, we include information about\ndisk presence and X-ray emission. Results. We report very large differences in\nthe disk fractions of low mass stars and brown dwarfs (~58%) when compared to\nhigher mass stars (26+4-3%) with 0.6 Msun being the critical mass we find for\nthis dichotomy. As a byproduct, we address the implications of the spatial\ndistribution of disk and diskless members in the formation scenario of the\ncluster itself. We have used the Halpha emission to discriminate among\naccreting and non-accreting sources finding that 38+8-7% of sources harboring\ndisks undergo active accretion and that his percentage stays similar in the\nsubstellar regime. For those sources we have estimated accretion rates.\nFinally, regarding rotational velocities, we find a high dispersion in vsin(i)\nwhich is even larger among the diskless population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 12:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

Then, we show that detecting attacks can be parallelized, and can\nbe solved using state reachability queries under SC semantics in a suitably\ninstrumented program obtained by a linear size source-to-source translation.\nImportantly, the construction is valid for an arbitrary number of addresses and\nan arbitrary number of parallel threads, and it is independent from the data\ndomain and from the size of store buffers in the TSO semantics. In particular,\nwhen the data domain is finite and the number of addresses is fixed, we obtain\ndecidability and complexity results for robustness, even for an arbitrary\nnumber of threads.\n  As a second contribution, we provide an algorithm for computing an optimal\nset of fences that enforce robustness. We consider two criteria of optimality:\nminimization of program size and maximization of its performance. The\nalgorithms we define are implemented, and we successfully applied them to\nanalyzing and correcting several concurrent algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 12:32:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 10:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-30"}

To\ndetect statistically significant communities, a common approach is to resample\nthe original network and analyze the communities. But resampling assumes\nindependence between samples, while the components of a network are inherently\ndependent. Therefore, we must understand how breaking dependencies between\nresampled components affects the results of the significance analysis. Here we\nuse scientific communication as a model system to analyze this effect. Our\ndataset includes citations among articles published in journals in the years\n1984-2010. We compare parametric resampling of citations with non-parametric\narticle resampling. While citation resampling breaks link dependencies, article\nresampling maintains such dependencies. We find that citation resampling\nunderestimates the variance of link weights. Moreover, this underestimation\nexplains most of the differences in the significance analysis of ranking and\nclustering. Therefore, when only link weights are available and article\nresampling is not an option, we suggest a simple parametric resampling scheme\nthat generates link-weight variances close to the link-weight variances of\narticle resampling. Nevertheless, when we highlight and summarize important\nstructural changes in science, the more dependencies we can maintain in the\nresampling scheme, the earlier we can predict structural change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 12:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 10:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-12"}

We establish a convergence result to asymptotic\nsolutions as time goes to infinity under rather general assumptions by using\ndynamical properties of value functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 15:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 04:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-13"}

A prominent example is the Efimov effect, which predicts\nthe emergence of an infinite tower of three-body bound states obeying discrete\nscale invariance when the particles interact resonantly. Because of its\nuniversality and peculiarity, the Efimov effect has been the subject of\nextensive research in chemical, atomic, nuclear and particle physics for\ndecades. Here we employ an anisotropic Heisenberg model to show that collective\nexcitations in quantum magnets (magnons) also exhibit the Efimov effect. We\nlocate anisotropy-induced two-magnon resonances, compute binding energies of\nthree magnons and find that they fit into the universal scaling law. We propose\nseveral approaches to experimentally realize the Efimov effect in quantum\nmagnets, where the emergent Efimov states of magnons can be observed with\ncommonly used spectroscopic measurements. Our study thus opens up new avenues\nfor universal few-body physics in condensed matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 15:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2013 11:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-08-26"}

The algebra generated by SDEs in tensor models (for random tensors in a\nsuitable ensemble) is a specific generalization of the Virasoro algebra and it\nis important to show that these new symmetries determine the physical\nsolutions. We prove this result for random tensors at large N. Compared to\nmatrix models, tensor models have more than a single invariant at each order in\nthe tensor entries and the SDEs make them proliferate. However, the specific\ncombinatorics of the dominant observables allows to restrict to linear SDEs and\nwe show that they determine a unique physical perturbative solution.

The\nleading idea is to describe the trading of these goods by means of some\nfundamental rules in price theory, in particular by using Cobb-Douglas utility\nfunctions for the binary exchange, and the Edgeworth box for the description of\nthe common exchange area in which utility is increasing for both agents. This\nleads to a Boltzmann-type equation in which the post-interaction variables\ndepend in a nonlinear way from the pre-interaction ones. Other models will be\nderived, by suitably linearizing this Boltzmann equation. In presence of\nuncertainty in the exchanges, it is shown that the solution to some of the\nlinearized kinetic equations develop Pareto tails, where the Pareto index\ndepends on the ratio between the gain and the variance of the uncertainty. In\nparticular, the result holds true for the solution of a drift-diffusion\nequation of Fokker-Planck type, obtained from the linear Boltzmann equation as\nthe limit of quasi-invariant trades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 19:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
