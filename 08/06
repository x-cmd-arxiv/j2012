The model consists of input-output transfer\nfunctions, which are derived from differential equations, using stable\nequilibria. We select a set of 'source' species, which receive input signals.\nSignals are transmitted to all other species in the system (the 'target'\nspecies) with a specific delay and transmission strength. The delay is computed\nas the maximal reaction time until a stable equilibrium for the target species\nis reached, in the context of all other reactions in the system. The\ntransmission strength is the concentration change of the target species. The\ncomputed input-output transfer functions can be stored in a matrix, fitted with\nparameters, and recalled to build discrete dynamical models. By separating\nreaction time and concentration we can greatly simplify the model,\ncircumventing typical problems of complex dynamical systems. The transfer\nfunction transformation can be applied to mass-action kinetic models of signal\ntransduction. The paper shows that this approach yields significant insight,\nwhile remaining an executable dynamical model for signal transduction. In\nparticular we can deconstruct the complex system into local transfer functions\nbetween individual species. As an example, we examine modularity and signal\nintegration using a published model of striatal neural plasticity. The modules\nthat emerge correspond to a known biological distinction between\ncalcium-dependent and cAMP-dependent pathways. We also found that overall\ninterconnectedness depends on the magnitude of input, with high connectivity at\nlow input and less connectivity at moderate to high input. This general result,\nwhich directly follows from the properties of individual transfer functions,\ncontradicts notions of ubiquitous complexity by showing input-dependent signal\ntransmission inactivation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2012 21:42:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Aug 2012 14:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 21:59:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2013 04:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-26"}

Many manifold learning methods require the estimation of the tangent\nspace of the manifold at a point from locally available data samples. Local\nsampling conditions such as (i) the size of the neighborhood (sampling width)\nand (ii) the number of samples in the neighborhood (sampling density) affect\nthe performance of learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a theoretical\nanalysis of local sampling conditions for the estimation of the tangent space\nat a point P lying on a m-dimensional Riemannian manifold S in R^n. Assuming a\nsmooth embedding of S in R^n, we estimate the tangent space T_P S by performing\na Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on points sampled from the neighborhood of\nP on S. Our analysis explicitly takes into account the second order properties\nof the manifold at P, namely the principal curvatures as well as the higher\norder terms. We consider a random sampling framework and leverage recent\nresults from random matrix theory to derive conditions on the sampling width\nand the local sampling density for an accurate estimation of tangent subspaces.\nWe measure the estimation accuracy by the angle between the estimated tangent\nspace and the true tangent space T_P S and we give conditions for this angle to\nbe bounded with high probability.

The \"{\\delta}N formalism\" is a popular\nand powerful technique for computing non-linear evolution of cosmological\nperturbations on large scales. In particular, it enables us to compute the\ncurvature perturbation, {\\zeta}, on large scales without actually solving\nperturbed field equations. However, people often wonder why this is the case.\nIn order for this approach to be valid, the perturbed Hamiltonian constraint\nand matter-field equations on large scales must, with a suitable choice of\ncoordinates, take on the same forms as the corresponding unperturbed equations.\nWe find that this is possible when (1) the unperturbed metric is given by a\nhomogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric; and (2)\non large scales and with a suitable choice of coordinates, one can ignore the\nshift vector (g0i) as well as time-dependence of tensor perturbations to\ngij/a2(t) of the perturbed metric. While the first condition has to be assumed\na priori, the second condition can be met when (3) the anisotropic stress\nbecomes negligible on large scales. However, in order to explicitly show that\nthe second condition follows from the third condition, one has to use\ngravitational field equations, and thus this statement may depend on the\ndetails of theory of gravitation. Finally, as the {\\delta}N formalism uses only\nthe Hamiltonian constraint and matter-field equations, it does not a priori\nrespect the momentum constraint. We show that the violation of the momentum\nconstraint only yields a decaying mode solution for {\\zeta}, and the violation\nvanishes when the slow-roll conditions are satisfied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 02:51:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 13:17:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2013 15:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

It is analytically\nshown that under an applied electric field, the spin density wave gains a\ntime-dependent phase shift $\\phi(t)$. Without the spin-orbit coupling, the\nphase shift increases linearly with time and is equivalent to a normal Doppler\nshift in optical measurements. Due to the joint effect of spin-orbit coupling\nand the applied electric field, the phase shift behaviors differently at the\nearly and the later stages. At the early stage, the phase shifts are the same\nwith or without the spin-orbit coupling. While at the later stage, the phase\nshift deviates from the normal Doppler one when the spin-orbit coupling is\npresent. The crossover time from the early normal Doppler behavior to the\nanomalous one at the later stage is inversely proportional to the spin\ndiffusion coefficient, wave vector of the spin density wave and the spin-orbit\ncoupling strength. In the high temperature regime, the crossover time becomes\nlarge as a result of the decreased spin diffusion coefficient.

The \"Rhineland Hypothesis\" proposes\nthat Eastern European Jews emerged from a small group of German Jews who\nmigrated eastward and expanded rapidly. Alternatively, the \"Khazarian\nHypothesis\" suggests that Eastern European descended from Judean tribes who\njoined the Khazars, an amalgam of Turkic clans that settled the Caucasus in the\nearly centuries CE and converted to Judaism in the 8th century. The Judaized\nEmpire was continuously reinforced with Mesopotamian and Greco-Roman Jews until\nthe 13th century. Following the collapse of their empire, the Judeo-Khazars\nfled to Eastern Europe. The rise of European Jewry is therefore explained by\nthe contribution of the Judeo-Khazars. Thus far, however, their contribution\nhas been estimated only empirically; the absence of genome-wide data from\nCaucasus populations precluded testing the Khazarian Hypothesis. Recent\nsequencing of modern Caucasus populations prompted us to revisit the Khazarian\nHypothesis and compare it with the Rhineland Hypothesis. We applied a wide\nrange of population genetic analyses - including principal component,\nbiogeographical origin, admixture, identity by descent, allele sharing\ndistance, and uniparental analyses - to compare these two hypotheses. Our\nfindings support the Khazarian Hypothesis and portray the European Jewish\ngenome as a mosaic of Caucasus, European, and Semitic ancestries, thereby\nconsolidating previous contradictory reports of Jewish ancestry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 06:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-19"}

A small bipole emerged in\nthe sunspot complex and subsequently created a quadrupolar flux system.\nNon-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation from vector magnetograms\nreveals its energetic nature: the fast-shearing bipole accumulated ~2e31 erg\nfree energy (10% of AR total) over just one day despite its relatively small\nmagnetic flux (5% of AR total). During the eruption, the ejected plasma\nfollowed a highly inclined trajectory, over 60 degrees with respect to the\nradial direction, forming a jet-like, inverted-Y shaped structure in its wake.\nField extrapolation suggests complicated magnetic connectivity with a coronal\nnull point, which is favorable of reconnection between different flux\ncomponents in the quadrupolar system. Indeed, multiple pairs of flare ribbons\nbrightened simultaneously, and coronal reconnection signatures appeared near\nthe inferred null. Part of the magnetic setting resembles that of a\nblowout-type jet; the observed inverted-Y structure likely outlines the open\nfield lines along the separatrix surface.

Considerable dispersion in this\nrelation discovered for normal galaxies, however, complicates its usability. In\norder to investigate the cause of the dispersion, in this paper, we select five\nnearby spiral galaxies, and perform spatially resolved studies on each of the\ngalaxies, with a combination of ultraviolet and infrared imaging data. We\nmeasure all positions within each galaxy and divide the extracted regions into\nyoung and evolved stellar populations. By means of this approach, we attempt to\ndiscover separate effects of dust attenuation and stellar population age on the\nIRX-UV relation for individual galaxies. In this work, in addition to dust\nattenuation, stellar population age is interpreted to be another parameter in\nthe IRX-UV function, and the diversity of star formation histories is suggested\nto disperse the age effects. At the same time, strong evidence shows the\nnecessity of more parameters in the interpretation of observational data, such\nas variations in attenuation/extinction law. Fractional contributions of\ndifferent components to the integrated luminosities of the galaxies suggest\nthat the integrated measurements of galaxies which comprise different\npopulations would weaken the effect of the age parameter on IRX-UV diagrams.\nThe dependance of the IRX-UV relation on luminosity and radial distance in\ngalaxies presents weak trends, which offers an implication of selective\neffects.

We study physical processes\ngiving rise to the variable emission of SgrA* from the radio to the X-ray\ndomain. To explain the statistics of the observed variability of the (sub-)mm\nspectrum of SgrA*, we use a sample of simultaneous NIR/X-ray flare peaks and\nmodel the flares using a synchrotron and SSC mechanism. The observations reveal\nflaring activity in all wavelength bands that can be modeled as the signal from\nadiabatically expanding synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) components. The model\nparameters suggest that either the adiabatically expanding source components\nhave a bulk motion larger than v_exp or the expanding material contributes to a\ncorona or disk, confined to the immediate surroundings of SgrA*. For the bulk\nof the synchrotron and SSC models, we find synchrotron turnover frequencies in\nthe range 300-400 GHz. For the pure synchrotron models this results in\ndensities of relativistic particles of the order of 10^6.5 cm^-3 and for the\nSSC models, the median densities are about one order of magnitude higher.\nHowever, to obtain a realistic description of the frequency-dependent\nvariability amplitude of SgrA*, models with higher turnover frequencies and\neven higher densities are required.

In such cases, one can resort to so-called choice functions. They\nprovide a means to determine which options in a particular set are optimal, and\nallow incomparability among any number of options. Applying choice functions in\nsequential decision problems can be highly non-trivial, as the usual properties\nof maximising expected utility may no longer be satisfied. In this paper, we\nstudy one of these properties: we revisit and reinterpret Selten's concept of\nsubgame perfectness in the context of decision trees, leading us to the concept\nof subtree perfectness, which basically says that the optimal solution of a\ndecision tree should not depend on any larger tree it may be embedded in. In\nother words, subtree perfectness excludes counterfactual reasoning, and\ntherefore may be desirable from some philosophical points of view. Subtree\nperfectness is also desirable from a practical point of view, because it admits\nefficient algorithms for solving decision trees, such as backward induction.\nThe main contribution of this paper is a very simple non-technical criterion\nfor determining whether any given choice function will satisfy subtree\nperfectness or not. We demonstrate the theorem and illustrate subtree\nperfectness, or the lack thereof, through numerous examples, for a wide variety\nof choice functions, where incomparability amongst strategies can be caused by\nimprecision in either probabilities or utilities. We find that almost no choice\nfunction, except for maximising expected utility, satisfies it in general. We\nalso find that choice functions other than maximising expected utility can\nsatisfy it, provided that we restrict either the structure of the tree, or the\nstructure of the choice function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 12:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-10"}

In both regimes of motion the resulting force comprises\nlateral and normal velocity-dependent components which may depend in a subtle\nway on the Doppler effect and TE-TM polarization mixing. For lateral\ndisplacements in particular, polarization mixing, which is here interpreted as\nan effective magneto-electric effect due to the reduced symmetry induced by the\nmotion of the slab, gives rise to a velocity dependent force contribution that\nis sensitive to the phase difference between the two polarization amplitudes.\nThis term gives rise to a rather peculiar optical response on the moving body\nand specific caseses are illustrated for incident radiation of arbitrarily\ndirected linear polarization. The additional force due to polarization mixing\nmay cancel to first order in V/c with the first order Doppler contribution\nyielding an overall vanishing of the velocity-dependent component of the force\non the body.

Typically variable screening based on model fits using only main\neffects must be performed first. One problem with screening is that important\nvariables may be missed if they are only useful for prediction when certain\ninteraction terms are also present in the model.\n  To tackle this issue, we introduce a new method we call Backtracking.

We also determine the potential of the phantom scalar\nfield and phantom tachyon field corresponding to the generalized equation of\nstate $p=(\\alpha \\rho+k\\rho^{1+1/n})c^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 15:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

The major drawback of\nminwise hashing is the expensive preprocessing cost, as the method requires\napplying (e.g.,) k=200 to 500 permutations on the data. The testing time can\nalso be expensive if a new data point (e.g., a new document or image) has not\nbeen processed, which might be a significant issue in user-facing applications.\n  We develop a very simple solution based on one permutation hashing.\nConceptually, given a massive binary data matrix, we permute the columns only\nonce and divide the permuted columns evenly into k bins; and we simply store,\nfor each data vector, the smallest nonzero location in each bin. The\ninteresting probability analysis (which is validated by experiments) reveals\nthat our one permutation scheme should perform very similarly to the original\n(k-permutation) minwise hashing. In fact, the one permutation scheme can be\neven slightly more accurate, due to the \"sample-without-replacement\" effect.\n  Our experiments with training linear SVM and logistic regression on the\nwebspam dataset demonstrate that this one permutation hashing scheme can\nachieve the same (or even slightly better) accuracies compared to the original\nk-permutation scheme. To test the robustness of our method, we also experiment\nwith the small news20 dataset which is very sparse and has merely on average\n500 nonzeros in each data vector. Interestingly, our one permutation scheme\nnoticeably outperforms the k-permutation scheme when k is not too small on the\nnews20 dataset. In summary, our method can achieve at least the same accuracy\nas the original k-permutation scheme, at merely 1/k of the original\npreprocessing cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 12:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-08"}
