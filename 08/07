But this requires a thorough study to extract the strength and weakness of\nthe most recognized cryptosystems. Our first goal in this work is to approach\nto this standardization, by applying a study which permit to extract the best\ncryptosystems. As we will see in this work and as Boneh and Boyen said in 2011\n(Journal of Cryptology) the BB1 and BB2 are the most efficient schemes in the\nmodel selective ID and without random oracle (they are the only schemes traced\nin this model). This is right as those schemes are secure (under this model),\nefficient and useful for some applications. Our second goal behind this work is\nto make an approvement in BB2 to admit a more efficient schemes. We will study\nthe security of our schemes, which is basing on an efficient strong\nDiffie-Hellman problem compared to BB1 and BB2. More than that our HIBE support\ns+ID-HIBE compared to BBG (Boneh Boyen Goh). Additionally the ID in our scheme\nwill be in Zp instead of Zp* as with BBG.

The work function was\nfound to increase with uniaxial tensile strain while decreasing with\ncompression. The variation of the work function under strain is primarily due\nto the shift of the Fermi energy with strain. In addition, the relationship\nbetween the work function variation and the core level shift with strain is\ndiscussed. Distinct trends of the core level shift under tensile and\ncompressive strain were discovered. For AGNRs with the edge carbon atoms\npassivated by oxygen, the work function is higher than for nanoribbons with the\nedge passivated by hydrogen under a moderate strain. The difference between the\nwork functions in these two edge passivations is enlarged (reduced) under a\nsufficient tensile (compressive) strain. This has been correlated to a\ndirect-indirect band gap transition for tensile strains of about 4% and to a\nstructural transformation for large compressive strains at about -12%.\nFurthermore, the effect of the surface species decoration, such as H, F, or OH\nwith different covering density, was investigated. It was found that the work\nfunction varies with the type and coverage of surface functional species. F and\nOH decoration increase the work function while H decreases it. The surface\nfunctional species were decorated on either one side or both sides of AGNRs.\nThe difference in the work functions between one-side and two-side decorations\nwas found to be relatively small, which may suggest an introduced surface\ndipole plays a minor role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 19:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

Several tree-SPH\n(smoothed particle hydrodynamics) simulations have been carried out to study\nthe dependence of the star formation rate on the mass and size of a stellar\nbulge. In addition, different strengths of ram pressure and different\nalignments of the disc with respect to the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are\napplied. As claimed in previous works, when ram pressure is acting on a galaxy,\nthe star formation rate (SFR) is enhanced and rises up to four times with\nincreasing ICM density compared to galaxies that evolve in isolation. However,\na bulge suppresses the SFR when the same ram pressure is applied. Consequently,\nfewer new stars are formed because the SFR can be lowered by up to 2 M_sun/yr.\nFurthermore, the denser the surrounding gas, the more inter-stellar medium\n(ISM) is stripped. While at an ICM density of 10^-28 g/cm^3 about 30% of the\nISM is stripped, the galaxy is almost completely (more than 90%) stripped when\nan ICM density of 10^-27 g/cm^3 is applied. But again, a bulge prevents the\nstripping of the ISM and reduces the amount being stripped by up to 10%.\nThereby, fewer stars are formed in the wake if the galaxy contains a bulge. The\ndependence of the SFR on the disc tilt angle is not very pronounced. Hereby a\nslight trend of decreasing star formation with increasing inclination angle can\nbe determined. Furthermore, with increasing disc tilt angles, less gas is\nstripped and therefore fewer stars are formed in the wake. Reducing the disc\ngas mass fraction results in a lower SFR when the galaxies evolve in vacuum. On\nthe other hand, the enhancement of the SFR in case of acting ram pressure is\nless pronounced with increasing gas mass fraction. Moreover, the fractional\namount of stripped gas does not depend on the gas mass fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 20:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

It will be showed and motivated that\nsocial systems are typically chaotic, non-linear and/or non-equilibrium and\ntherefore complex systems. It is discussed that the rapid change in global\nconsumer behaviour is underway, that further increases the complexity in\nbusiness and management. For policy making under complexity, following\nprinciples are offered: openness and international competition, tolerance and\nvariety of ideas, self-reliability and low dependence on external help. The\nchapter contains four applications that build on the theoretical motivation of\ncomplexity in social systems. The first application demonstrates that small\neconomies have good prospects to gain from the global processes underway, if\nthey can demonstrate production flexibility, reliable business ethics and good\nrisk management. The second application elaborates on and discusses the\nopportunities and challenges in decision making under complexity from macro and\nmicro economic perspective. In this environment, the challenges for corporate\nmanagement are being also permanently changed: the balance between short term\nnoise and long term chaos whose attractor includes customers, shareholders and\nemployees must be found. The emergence of chaos in economic relationships is\ndemonstrated by a simple system of differential equations that relate the\nstakeholders described above. The chapter concludes with two financial\napplications: about debt and risk management. The non-equilibrium economic\nestablishment leads to additional problems by using excessive borrowing;\nunexpected downturns in economy can more easily kill companies.

Here, we\ninvestigate how the intensity of interspecific competition influences the\npersistence time of a native species in the face of repeated and ongoing\nintroductions of the nonnative species. We analyze two stochastic models: a\nmodel for the population dynamics of both species and a model that additionally\nincludes the population genetics of the native species at a locus involved in\nits adaptation to a changing environment. Counterintuitively, both models\npredict that the persistence time of the native species is lowest for an\nintermediate intensity of competition. This phenomenon results from the\nopposing effects of competition at different stages of the invasion process:\nWith increasing competition intensity more introduction events are needed until\na new species can establish, but increasing competition also speeds up the\nexclusion of the native species by an established nonnative competitor. By\ncomparing the ecological and the eco-genetic model, we detect and quantify a\nsynergistic feedback between ecological and genetic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 21:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2013 18:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-03"}

Here, a\nfinite-element model of stresses near the front of a tidewater glacier is used\nto investigate the effects of frontal melting on calving, independently of the\ncalving criterion used. Applications of the stress model to idealized scenarios\nreveal that undercutting of the ice front due to frontal melting can drive\ncalving at up to ten times the mean melt rate. Factors which cause increased\nfrontal melt-driven calving include a strong thermal gradient in the ice, and a\nconcentration of frontal melt at the base of the glacier. These properties are\ntypical of both Arctic and Antarctic tidewater glaciers. The finding that\nfrontal melt near the base is a strong driver of calving leads to the\nconclusion that water temperatures near the bed of the glacier are critically\nimportant to the glacier front, and thus the flow of the glacier. These\nconclusions are robust against changes in the basal boundary condition and the\nchoice of calving criterion, as well as variations in the glacier size or level\nof crevassing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 22:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

We investigate their emission-line properties and compare them\nwith those of AGN with higher-mass black holes.

This trend of\nincreasing [O III] EW with line symmetry could be explained by a high covering\nfactor of lower ionization gas in the NLR.

It is shown that the admittance real part can be negative in a certain\nfrequency range. As revealed, if the i-section somewhat shorter than one\nmicrometer, this range corresponds to the terahertz frequencies. Due to the\neffect of the self-consistent electric field, the behavior of the GTUNNETT\nadmittance in the range of its negativity of its real part is rather sensitive\nto the relation between the number of graphene layers and dielectric constant.\nThe obtained results demonstrate that GTUNNETTs with optimized structure can be\nused in efficient terahertz oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 01:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Rather than analyzing this game directly, we consider a\nclosely related game in which the players choose positive real numbers between\n1 and 10, multiply them together, and move the decimal point, if necessary, so\nthat the result is between 1 and 10. The mixed strategies are probability\ndistributions on this interval, and it is shown that for both players it is\noptimal to choose their numbers from the Benford distribution.

The main pressure support of these bubbles is\nnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. For such a\nscenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays from\nthese systems. Hydra A, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale AGN\noutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being a\ngamma-ray emitter with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) array and\nthe Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Data obtained in 20.2 hours of\ndedicated H.E.S.S. observations and 38 months of Fermi-LAT data, gathered by\nits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-ray\nsignal. No signal has been found in either data set. Upper limits on the\ngamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. These are the first\nlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting cluster\nscale AGN outbursts. The non-detection of Hydra A in gamma-rays has important\nimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside the\nbubbles in this system. For the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadronic\ncosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing between\ncosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. However, hadronic cosmic\nrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubbles\nagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. The largest population of\nhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-Compton gamma-ray\nproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of Hydra A. The limit on the\ninverse-Compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of the\nequipartition value of 16 muG in the inner lobes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 08:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The INTEGRAL, RXTE, and Swift data reveal the X-ray pulsation at a\nperiod of 2.5 milliseconds up to ~65 keV. The pulsed fraction is consistent\nwith being constant, i.e. energy independent and has a typical value of 6-7%.\nThe nearly sinusoidal pulses show soft lags that seem to saturate near 10 keV\nat a rather small value of ~ -60\\mu s with those observed in other accreting\npulsars.

Thus, we hereby propose a unique\nmethod to perform efficient voice morphing and conversion based on GMM,which\novercomes the traditional-method effects of over-smoothening. It uses a\ntechnique of glottal waveform separation and prediction of excitations and\nhence the result shows that not only over-smoothening is eliminated but also\nthe transformed vocal tract parameters match with the target. Moreover, the\nsynthesized speech thus obtained is found to be of a sufficiently high quality.\nThus, voice morphing based on a unique GMM approach has been proposed and also\ncritically evaluated based on various subjective and objective evaluation\nparameters. Further, an application of voice morphing for Laryngectomees which\ndeploys this unique approach has been recommended by this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 13:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Evaluating quantitatively the\neffects of such excitation requires a realistic modeling of the momentum loss\nprofiles associated with stellar jets. In this work, we model linear momentum\nloss as a time-variable stochastic process that results in a zero mean stellar\nacceleration. Momentum loss may involve periodic or random polarity reversals.\nWe characterize orbital excitation as a function of the variability timescale\nand identify a novel excitation resonance between a planet's orbital period and\nthe jet's variability timescale where the former equals twice the latter. For\nconstant variability timescales, resonance is efficient for both periodic and\nrandom polarity reversals, the latter being stronger than the former. For a\ntime variable variability timescale, resonance crossing is a more efficient\nexcitation mechanism when polarity reversals are periodic. Each polarity\nreversal type has distinct features that may help constrain the magnetic\nhistory of the star through the observation of its planetary companions. For\ninstance, outward planet migration to large distances from parent stars is one\nof the natural outcomes of periodic polarity reversal excitation if resonance\ncrossing is sufficiently slow. Applying the excitation mechanism to the solar\nsystem, we find that the planet-jet variability resonance with periodic\npolarity reversal momentum loss is a possible origin for the hitherto\nunexplained inclination of Jupiter's orbit by 6 deg. with respect to the Sun's\nequator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 14:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 13:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

It is known\nthat all possible multiple tilers in 3D are zonotopes. In 2D it was known by\nthe work of M. Kolountzakis that, unless $P$ is a parallelogram, the multiset\nof translation vectors $\\Lambda$ must be a finite union of translated lattices\n(also known as quasi periodic sets). In that work [Kolountzakis, 2002], the\nauthor asked whether the same quasi-periodic structure on the translation\nvectors would be true in 3D. Here we prove that this conclusion is indeed true\nfor 3D.\n  Namely, we show that if $P$ is a convex multiple tiler in 3D, with a discrete\nmultiset $\\Lambda$ of translation vectors, then $\\Lambda$ has to be a finite\nunion of translated lattices, unless $P$ belongs to a special class of\nzonotopes. This exceptional class consists of two-flat zonotopes $P$, defined\nby the Minkowski sum of $n+m$ line segments that lie in the union of two\ndifferent two-dimensional subspaces $H_1$ and $H_2$. Equivalently, a two-flat\nzonotope $P$ may be thought of as the Minkowski sum of two 2-dimensional\nsymmetric polygons one of which may degenerate into a single line segment. It\nturns out that rational two-flat zonotopes admit a multiple tiling with an\naperiodic (non-quasi-periodic) set of translation vectors $\\Lambda$. We note\nthat it may be quite difficult to offer a visualization of these 3-dimensional\nnon-quasi-periodic tilings, and that we discovered them by using Fourier\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 15:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-09"}

It offers the ability for\ncustomers to have greater control and ready access applications of health\ninformation, clinical information, and social interaction between interested\ngroups. However, providing empowerment in any state of interaction levels to\ncustomers (patients) in a healthcare organization is challenging tasks.\nCustomers are empowered in the sense of controlling the process of interaction\nbetween a firm with its customers, and among customers themselves. This paper\ndiscusses dimension of customers' empowerment in e-health business process. We\npropose reference model of Personal Health Cycle (PHC) as a holistic view of\nhealthcare business process. The PHC is used to define and distinct electronic\nhealth record (EHR) from electronic medical record (EMR) and customers\nempowerment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2012 15:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

We formulate and develop the Structured Prediction Cascade\narchitecture: a sequence of increasingly complex models that progressively\nfilter the space of possible outputs. The key principle of our approach is that\neach model in the cascade is optimized to accurately filter and refine the\nstructured output state space of the next model, speeding up both learning and\ninference in the next layer of the cascade. We learn cascades by optimizing a\nnovel convex loss function that controls the trade-off between the filtering\nefficiency and the accuracy of the cascade, and provide generalization bounds\nfor both accuracy and efficiency. We also extend our approach to intractable\nmodels using tree-decomposition ensembles, and provide algorithms and theory\nfor this setting. We evaluate our approach on several large-scale problems,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance in handwriting recognition and human\npose recognition. We find that structured prediction cascades allow tremendous\nspeedups and the use of previously intractable features and models in both\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2012 16:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-17"}
