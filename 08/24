We show that if\nthe twist is initially concentrated inside the unstable layer, the\nmodifications of the instability reported by several authors (see e.g. Cattaneo\net al. (1990)) are only observed when the calculation is restricted to two\ndimensions. In three dimensions, the usual interchange instability occurs, in\nthe direction fixed by the field lines at the interface between the layer and\nthe field-free region. We therefore introduce a new configuration: the\ninstability now develops in a weakly magnetised atmosphere where the direction\nof the field can vary with respect to the direction of the strong unstable\nfield below, the twist being now concentrated at the upper interface. Both\nlinear stability analysis and non-linear direct numerical simulations are used\nto study this configuration. We show that from the small-scale interchange\ninstability, large-scale twisted coherent magnetic structures are spontaneously\nformed, with possible implications to the formation of active regions from a\ndeep-seated solar magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 16:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

As a result, PSWFs\nare becoming increasing popular in various areas in which such function occur -\nthis includes physics (e.g. wave phenomena, fluid dynamics), engineering (e.g.\nsignal processing, filter design), etc.\n  To use PSWFs as a computational tool, one needs fast and accurate numerical\nalgorithms for the evaluation of PSWFs and related quantities, as well as for\nthe construction of quadratures, interpolation formulas, etc. Even though, for\nthe last half a century, substantial progress has been made in design of such\nalgorithms, the complexity of many of the existing algorithms, however, is at\nleast quadratic in the band limit $c$. For example, the evaluation of the $n$th\neigenvalue of the prolate integral operator requires at least $O(c^2)$\noperations. Therefore, while the existing algorithms are quite satisfactory for\nmoderate values of $c$ (e.g. $c \\leq 10^3$), they tend to be relatively slow\nwhen $c$ is large (e.g. $c \\geq 10^4$).\n  In this paper, we describe several numerical algorithms for the evaluation of\nPSWFs and related quantities, and design a class of PSWF-based quadratures for\nthe integration of bandlimited functions. Also, we perform detailed analysis of\nthe related properties of PSWFs. While the analysis is somewhat involved, the\nresulting numerical algorithms are quite simple and efficient in practice.

The new algorithm is conceptually\nsimple, versatile and robust, and parallelises trivially; it combines features\nof extant evolutionary algorithms with some novel ones, and fares well on the\nproblem of fitting binary-lens microlensing lightcurves, as well as on a number\nof other difficult optimisation problems. Success rates in excess of 90% are\nachieved when fitting synthetic though noisy binary-lens lightcurves, allowing\nno more than 20 minutes per fit on a desktop computer; this success rate is\nshown to compare very favourably with that of both a conventional (iterated\nsimplex) algorithm, and a more state-of-the-art, artificial neural\nnetwork-based approach. As such, this work provides proof of concept for the\nuse of an evolutionary algorithm as the basis for real-time, autonomous\nmodelling of microlensing events. Further work is required to investigate how\nthe algorithm will fare when faced with more complex and realistic microlensing\nmodelling problems; it is, however, argued here that the use of parallel\ncomputing platforms, such as inexpensive graphics processing units, should\nallow fitting times to be constrained to under an hour, even when dealing with\ncomplicated microlensing models. In any event, it is hoped that this work might\nstimulate some interest in evolutionary algorithms, and that the algorithm\ndescribed here might prove useful for solving microlensing and/or more general\nmodel-fitting problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 19:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

We argue that the concept\nof corridor implied volatility (CIV) should be used instead of the popular\nmodel-free option-implied volatility (MFIV) when assessing the fractional\ncointegrating relation as the latter may introduce bias to the estimation. For\nthe realized volatility, we use recently proposed methods which are robust to\nnoise as well as jumps and interestingly we find that it does not affect the\nimplied-realized volatility relation. In addition, we develop a new tool for\nthe estimation of fractional cointegrating relation between implied and\nrealized volatility based on wavelets, a wavelet band least squares (WBLS). The\nmain advantage of WBLS in comparison to other frequency domain methods is that\nit allows us to work conveniently with potentially non-stationary volatility\ndue to the properties of wavelets. We study the dynamics of the relationship in\nthe time-frequency domain with the wavelet coherence confirming that the\ndependence comes solely from the lower frequencies of the spectra. Motivated by\nthis result we estimate the relationship only on this part of the spectra using\nWBLS and compare our results to the fully modified narrow-band least squares\n(FMNBLS) based on the Fourier frequencies. In the estimation, we use the S&P\n500 and DAX monthly and bi-weekly option prices covering the recent financial\ncrisis and we conclude that in the long-run, volatility inferred from the\noption prices using the corridor implied volatility (CIV) provides an unbiased\nforecast of the realized volatility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 19:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 19:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-15"}

This is\nthe first survey of [OI]63um, one of the main photodissociation region (PDR)\ncooling lines, in SMGs. New high-resolution ALMA interferometric 870um\ncontinuum imaging confirms that these six Herschel-targeted SMG counterparts\nare bona fide sources of submm emission.

Results indicated a pervasive\ninfluence of non-African admixture in many African populations, motivating the\ndevelopment and application of a novel admixture detection method. Admixture\nproportions varied among populations, with greater admixture in urban\nlocations. Admixture levels also varied across the genome, with localized peaks\nand valleys suggestive of a non-neutral introgression process. Genomes from the\nsame location differed starkly in ancestry, suggesting that isolation\nmechanisms may exist within African populations. After removing putatively\nadmixed genomic segments, the greatest genetic diversity was observed in\nsouthern Africa (e.g. Zambia), while diversity in other populations was largely\nconsistent with a geographic expansion from this potentially ancestral region.\nThe European population showed different levels of diversity reduction on each\nchromosome arm, and some African populations displayed chromosome arm-specific\ndiversity reductions. Inversions in the European sample were associated with\nstrong elevations in diversity across chromosome arms. Genomic scans were\nconducted to identify loci that may represent targets of positive selection. A\ndisproportionate number of candidate selective sweep regions were located near\ngenes with varied roles in gene regulation.

To test these\nhypotheses we utilized two established paradigms, behavioral priming and\nphysiological suppression, to examine response to the repetition of concepts\nacross perceptual modalities.\n  Typically, examinations of the relationship between behavioral priming and\nsuppression have queried the extent to which suppression effects in different\nbrain regions correlate with single measures of behavioral priming. In\ncontrast, we were interested in the extent to which suppression effects within\na single brain region would correlate with multiple measures of behavioral\npriming. While many sensory regions show suppression effects to specific\nperceptual repetitions, we hypothesized that a region engaged in conceptual\nrepresentation would show suppression effects to conceptual repetitions, even\nwhen the stimuli were perceptually distinct.\n  Using BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) data, we determined that\nsuppression effects in perirhinal cortex, a temporal lobe region, significantly\ncorrelate with behavioral priming in a multimodal manner.

To this end, we need to measure and model the linear\npolarization produced by scattering processes in strong UV lines, such as the\nhydrogen Ly$\\alpha$ line. The interpretation of the observed Stokes profiles\nwill require taking into account that the outer solar atmosphere is highly\nstructured and dynamic, and that the height of the transition region may well\nvary from one place in the atmosphere to another. Here we report on the\nLy$\\alpha$ scattering polarization signals we have calculated in a realistic\nmodel of an enhanced network region, resulting from a state-of-the-art\nradiation MHD simulation. This model is characterized by spatially complex\nvariations of the physical quantities at transition region heights.

More importantly, we show that via the Hanle effect the model's\nmagnetic field produces significant changes in the emergent $Q/I$ and $U/I$\nprofiles. Therefore, we argue that by measuring the polarization signals\nproduced by scattering processes and the Hanle effect in Ly$\\alpha$ and\ncontrasting them with those computed in increasingly realistic atmospheric\nmodels, we should be able to decipher the magnetic, thermal and dynamic\nstructure of the upper chromosphere and transition region of the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 08:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Using numerical solutions\ndescribing forced inertial modes of a uniformly rotating fluid inside a\nspherical shell, we first identify the observed oscillations of the Couette\nflow with non-axisymmetric, retrograde, equatorially anti-symmetric inertial\nmodes, confirming first attempts using a full sphere model. Although the model\nhas no differential rotation, identification is possible because a large\nfraction of the fluid in a spherical Couette flow rotates rigidly. From the\nobserved sequence of the excited modes appearing when the inner sphere is\nslowed down by step, we identify a critical Rossby number associated with a\ngiven mode and below which it is excited. The matching between this critical\nnumber and the one derived from the phase velocity of the numerically computed\nmodes shows that these modes are excited by an instability likely driven by the\ncritical layer that develops in the shear layer staying along the tangent\ncylinder of the inner sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 09:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

Such priors include a global spatial smoothing\nparameter, whereas real risk surfaces are likely to include areas of smooth\nevolution as well as discontinuities, the latter of which are known as risk\nboundaries. Therefore, this paper proposes an extension to the class of CAR\npriors, which can identify both areas of localised spatial smoothness and risk\nboundaries. However, allowing for this localised smoothing requires large\nnumbers of correlation parameters to be estimated, which are unlikely to be\nwell identified from the data.

Up to now this scenario has been studied\nmostly in 2D razor thin disks. A 3D study including, simultaneously, the\nformation and resulting dust concentration of the vortices with vertical\nsettling, was still missing. The Rossby wave instability self-consistently\nforms 3D vortices, which have the unique quality of presenting a large scale\nvertical velocity in their centre. Here we aim to study how this newly\ndiscovered effect can alter the dynamic evolution of the dust. We perform\nglobal 3D simulations of the RWI in a radially and vertically stratified disk\nusing the code MPI-AMRVAC. After the growth phase of the instability, the gas\nand solid phases are modelled by a bi-fluid approach, where the dust is\nconsidered as a fluid without pressure. Both the drag force of the gas on the\ndust and the back-reaction of the dust on the gas are included. Multiple grain\nsizes from 1mm to 5cm are used with a constant density distribution. We obtain\nin a short timescale a high concentration of the largest grains in the\nvortices. Indeed, in 3 rotations the dust-to-gas density ratio grows from 10^-2\nto unity leading to a concentration of mass up to that of Mars in one vortex.\nThe presence of the radial drift is also at the origin of a dust pile-up at the\nradius of the vortices. Lastly, the vertical velocity of the gas in the vortex\ncauses the sedimentation process to be reversed, the mm size dust is lifted and\nhigher concentrations are obtained in the upper layer than in the mid-plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 10:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We present a new image recognition algorithm that allows us to\ndifferentiate features within a 3-D data cube (longitude, latitude, radial\nvelocity) and to parameterize individual coherent structures. We compiled an HI\nobject catalog of LA objects within an area of 70 degr x 85 degr (1.6 sr) of\nthe LA region.

Some blended gas components\n(we estimate 5%) escape detection, but we find a total gas content of the LA\nthat is about 50% higher than previously assumed. These methods allow the\ndeceleration of the LA clouds to be traced towards the Milky Way disk by drag\nforces. The derived velocity gradient strongly supports the assumption that the\nwhole LA originates entirely in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).

The\ndissipative force acting on stars in the disk leads to an enhanced mass flow\ntowards the super-massive black hole and to an asymmetry in the phase space\ndistribution due to the rotating accretion disk. The accretion disk is\nconsidered as a stationary Keplerian rotating disk, which is vertically\nextended in order to employ a fully self-consistent treatment of stellar\ndynamics including the dissipative force originating from star-gas ram pressure\neffects. The stellar system is treated with a direct high-accuracy N-body\nintegration code. A star-by-star representation, desirable in N-body\nsimulations, cannot be extended to real particle numbers yet. Hence, we\ncarefully discuss the scaling behavior of our model with regard to particle\nnumber and tidal accretion radius. The main idea is to find a family of models\nfor which the ratio of two-body relaxation time and dissipation time (for\nkinetic energy of stellar orbits) is constant, which then allows us to\nextrapolate our results to real parameters of galactic nuclei. Our model is\nderived from basic physical principles and as such it provides insight into the\nrole of physical processes in galactic nuclei, but it should be regarded as a\nfirst step towards more realistic and more comprehensive simulations.\nNevertheless, the following conclusions appear to be robust: the star accretion\nrate onto the accretion disk and subsequently onto the super-massive black hole\nis enhanced by a significant factor compared to purely stellar dynamical\nsystems neglecting the disk. This process leads to enhanced fueling of central\ndisks in active galactic nuclei and to an enhanced rate of tidal stellar\ndisruptions.

The simplifications that can happen in this limit, and that we will\nconsider, are: (i) the theory's Feynman diagrams can be drawn on a plane\nwithout lines intersecting (called `planarity'); and (ii) the theory, or a\nsector of it, becomes integrable, and indeed corresponds to a well-studied\nsystem, viz. a spin chain. Planarity is important because it shows how a\nquantum field theory can exhibit extended, in particular string-like,\nstructures; in some cases, this gives a connection with string theory, and thus\nwith gravity.\n  Previous philosophical literature about how one theory (or a sector, or\nregime, of a theory) might be emergent from, and-or reduced to, another one has\ntended to emphasize cases, such as occur in statistical mechanics, where the\nsystem before the limit has finitely many degrees of freedom.

It has been suggested that these\nexcesses may be due to light mass, m_chi ~ 5-10 GeV, WIMPs. The Earth's motion\nwith respect to the Galactic rest frame leads to a directional dependence in\nthe WIMP scattering rate, providing a powerful signal of the Galactic origin of\nany recoil excess. We investigate whether direct detection experiments with\ndirectional sensitivity have the potential to observe this anisotropic\nscattering rate with the elastically scattering light WIMPs proposed to explain\nthe observed excesses. We find that the number of recoils required to detect an\nanisotropic signal from light WIMPs at 5 sigma significance varies from 7 to\nmore than 190 over the set of target nuclei and energy thresholds expected for\ndirectional detectors. Smaller numbers arise from configurations where the\ndetector is only sensitive to recoils from the highest speed, and hence most\nanisotropic, WIMPs. However, the event rate above threshold is very small in\nthese cases, leading to the need for large experimental exposures to accumulate\neven a small number of events. To account for this sensitivity to the tail of\nthe WIMP velocity distribution, whose shape is not well known, we consider two\nexemplar halo models spanning the range of possibilities.

In contrast to the band structure calculations, it is found\nthat the parent phase of CeOBiS$_2$ is a bad metal, instead of an band\ninsulator. By doping electrons into the system, it is surprising to find that\nsuperconductivity appears together with an insulating normal state. This\nevolution is clearly different from the cuprate and the iron pnictide systems,\nand is interpreted as approaching the von Hove singularity. Furthermore,\nferromagnetism which may arise from the Ce moments, has been observed in the\nlow temperature region in all samples, suggesting the co-existence of\nsuperconductivity and ferromagnetism in the superconducting samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 15:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-01"}

This theory yields a generalized Lindblad\nequation for the density operator of the dot, with time-dependent damping and\ndecoherence due to phonon transitions between the instantaneous dressed states.\nIt captures similar physics to the form recently applied to Rabi oscillation\nexperiments [A. J. Ramsay et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 017402 (2010)], but\nguarantees positivity of the density operator. At sufficiently low\ntemperatures, it gives results equivalent to those of fully non-Markovian\napproaches [S. Luker et al., Phys. Rev.

We apply it to adiabatic rapid passage experiments, and show how the\npulses can be shaped to maximize the probability of creating a single exciton\nusing a frequency-swept laser pulse. We also use this theory to propose and\nanalyze methods to determine the phonon density of states experimentally, i.e.\nphonon spectroscopy, by exploring the dependence of the effective damping rates\non the driving field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 15:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 May 2013 15:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}

In this paper, we\nimprove this result by showing that a binary alphabet is sufficient to\nestablish this hierarchy. As a consequence of our construction, we solve the\nopen problem formulated by Meduna et al. Then we extend these results to\nm-state realtime deterministic pushdown automata, for all m at least 1.
