This central theme is\nmotivated by a host of applications, e.g., in mathematical physics, and in\nstochastic differential equations, and their use in financial models. In this\npaper, we show that, for three classes of cases in the correspondence, it is\npossible to obtain explicit formulas which are amenable to computations of the\nrespective Gaussian stochastic processes. For achieving this, we first develop\ntwo functional analytic tools. They are: $(i)$ an identification of a universal\nsample space $\\Omega$ where we may realize the particular Gaussian processes in\nthe correspondence; and (ii) a procedure for discretizing computations in\n$\\Omega$. The three classes of processes we study are as follows: Processes\nassociated with: (a) arbitrarily given sigma finite regular measures on a fixed\nBorel measure space; (b) with Hilbert spaces of sigma-functions; and (c) with\nsystems of self-similar measures arising in the theory of iterated function\nsystems.

The\nobjective is to spread multiple rumors over a graph as efficiently as possible.\nFWR accomplishes this by having nodes record which messages they have forwarded\nto each neighbor, so that each message is forwarded at most once to each\nneighbor. We prove that FWR spreads a rumor over a strongly connected digraph,\nwith high probability, in time which is within a constant factor of optimal for\ndigraphs with bounded out-degree. Moreover, on digraphs with bounded out-degree\nand bounded number of rumors, the number of transmissions required by FWR is\narbitrarily better than that of existing approaches. Specifically, FWR requires\nO(n) messages on bounded-degree graphs with n nodes, whereas classical\nforwarding and an approach based on network coding both require {\\omega}(n)\nmessages. Our results are obtained using combinatorial and probabilistic\narguments. Notably, they do not depend on expansion properties of the\nunderlying graph, and consequently the message complexity of FWR is arbitrarily\nbetter than classical forwarding even on constant-degree expander graphs, as n\n\\rightarrow \\infty. In resource-constrained applications, where each\ntransmission consumes battery power and bandwidth, our results suggest that\nusing a small amount of memory at each node leads to a significant savings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2012 18:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-15"}

Planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary disk\nof planetesimals was large (M_disk>50 M_Earth), but we found that a massive\ndisk would lead to excessive dynamical damping (e.g., final e_55 < 0.01\ncompared to present e_55=0.044, where e_55 is the amplitude of the fifth\neccentric mode in the Jupiter's orbit), and to smooth migration that violates\nconstraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets.

Due to short free-fall times, these high-density regions achieve high\nlocal star formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound clusters.\nStar-forming regions of lower density remain substructured and gas-rich, ending\nup unbound when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the tidal\nperturbation of star-forming regions by nearby, dense giant molecular clouds\nimposes a minimum density contrast required for the collapse to a bound\ncluster. The fraction of all star formation that occurs in bound stellar\nclusters (the cluster formation efficiency or CFE) follows by integration of\nthese local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum\nof the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE as a\nfunction of observable galaxy properties, and find that it increases with the\ngas surface density, from ~1% in low-density galaxies to a peak value of ~70%\nat densities of ~10^3 Msun pc^-2. This explains the observation that the CFE\nincreases with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf, spiral, and\nstarburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our model results with observed galaxies\nyields excellent agreement. The model is applied further by calculating the\nspatial variation of the CFE within single galaxies.

Mid-IR integrated optical systems are\ncapable of addressing applications including industrial process and\nenvironmental monitoring, threat detection, medical diagnostics, and free-space\ncommunication. Rapid progress has led to the demonstration of various silicon\ncomponents designed for the on-chip processing of mid-IR signals, including\nwaveguides, vertical grating couplers, microcavities, and electrooptic\nmodulators. Even so, a notable obstacle to the continued advancement of\nchip-scale systems is imposed by the narrow-bandgap semiconductors, such as\nInSb and HgCdTe, traditionally used to convert mid-IR photons to electrical\ncurrents. The cryogenic or multi-stage thermo-electric cooling required to\nsuppress dark current noise, exponentially dependent upon the ratio Eg/kT, can\nlimit the development of small, low-power, and low-cost integrated optical\nsystems for the mid-IR.

Recent studies indicate that some pathologies present\ntopological network alterations relative to norms seen in the general\npopulation. Therefore, methods to discriminate the processes that generate the\ndifferent classes of networks (e.g., normal and disease) might be crucial for\nthe diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. It is known that\nseveral topological properties of a network (graph) can be described by the\ndistribution of the spectrum of its adjacency matrix. Moreover, large networks\ngenerated by the same random process have the same spectrum distribution,\nallowing us to use it as a \"fingerprint\". Based on this relationship, we\nintroduce and propose the entropy of a graph spectrum to measure the\n\"uncertainty\" of a random graph and the Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon\ndivergences between graph spectra to compare networks.

The variability of the\ntransit depth is then a consequence of changes in the cloud optical depth.\nAims. We aim to validate the disintegrating-planet scenario by modeling the\ndetailed shape of the observed light curve, and thereby constrain the cloud\nparticle properties to better understand the nature of this intriguing object.\nMethods. We analysed the six publicly-available quarters of raw Kepler data,\nphase-folded the light curve and fitted it to a model for the trailing dust\ncloud. Constraints on the particle properties were investigated with a\nlight-scattering code. Results. The light curve exhibits clear signatures of\nlight scattering and absorption by dust, including a brightening in flux just\nbefore ingress correlated with the transit depth and explained by forward\nscattering, and an asymmetry in the transit light curve shape, which is easily\nreproduced by an exponentially decaying distribution of optically thin dust,\nwith a typical grain size of 0.1 micron.

Instead of using observed\nshears and redshifts to constrain cosmological parameters, we ask how well the\nshears around clusters can constrain the redshifts, assuming fixed cosmological\nparameters. This provides a check on photometric redshifts, independent of\nsource spectral energy distribution properties and therefore free of\nconfounding factors such as misidentification of spectral breaks. We find that\n~40 massive ($\\sigma_v=1200$ km/s) cluster lenses are sufficient to determine\nthe fraction of sources in each of six coarse redshift bins to ~11%, given weak\n(20%) priors on the masses of the highest-redshift lenses, tight (5%) priors on\nthe masses of the lowest-redshift lenses, and only modest (20-50%) priors on\ncalibration and evolution effects. Additional massive lenses drive down\nuncertainties as $N_{lens}^0.5$, but the improvement slows as one is forced to\nuse lenses further down the mass function. Future large surveys contain enough\nclusters to reach 1% precision in the bin fractions if the tight lens mass\npriors can be maintained for large samples of lenses.

Hence, gate voltage modulation of edge states via a QPC can\nprovide a means of modulating the spin or charge current flow in TI-based\nspintronics devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 05:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-25"}

These entities fully characterize the vacuum Riemann tensor.\nIn this paper, we compute and depict the tendex and vortex lines, and their\ntendicities and vorticities, outside the horizons of stationary (Schwarzschild\nand Kerr) black holes; and we introduce and depict the black holes' horizon\ntendicity and vorticity (the normal-normal components of $E$ and $B$ on the\nhorizon). For Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, the horizon tendicity is\nproportional to the horizon's intrinsic scalar curvature, and the horizon\nvorticity is proportional to an extrinsic scalar curvature. We show that, for\nhorizon-penetrating time slices, all these entities ($E$, $B$, the tendex lines\nand vortex lines, the lines' tendicities and vorticities, and the horizon\ntendicities and vorticities) are affected only weakly by changes of slicing and\nchanges of spatial coordinates, within those slicing and coordinate choices\nthat are commonly used for black holes.

These modes can be classified by\nmode indexes (n,l,m), and parity, which can be electric [(-1)^l] or magnetic\n[(-1)^(l+1)]. Among our discoveries are these: (i) There is a near duality\nbetween modes of the same (n,l,m): a duality in which the tendex and vortex\nstructures of electric-parity modes are interchanged with the vortex and tendex\nstructures (respectively) of magnetic-parity modes. (ii) This near duality is\nperfect for the modes' complex eigenfrequencies (which are well known to be\nidentical) and perfect on the horizon; it is slightly broken in the equatorial\nplane of a non-spinning hole, and the breaking becomes greater out of the\nequatorial plane, and greater as the hole is spun up; but even out of the plane\nfor fast-spinning holes, the duality is surprisingly good. (iii)\nElectric-parity modes can be regarded as generated by 3-D tendexes that stick\nradially out of the horizon.

The proper\nmotions will use the Hipparcos data, with epoch 1991.25, as first epoch and the\nfirst intermediate-release Gaia astrometry, with epoch ~2014.5, as second\nepoch. The expected HTPM proper-motion standard errors are 30-190 muas/yr,\ndepending on stellar magnitude. Depending on the characteristics of an object,\nin particular its distance and velocity, its radial velocity can have a\nsignificant impact on the determination of its proper motion. The impact of\nthis perspective acceleration is largest for fast-moving, nearby stars. Our\ngoal is to determine, for each star in the Hipparcos catalogue, the\nradial-velocity standard error that is required to guarantee a negligible\ncontribution of perspective acceleration to the HTPM proper-motion precision.\nWe employ two evaluation criteria, both based on Monte-Carlo simulations, with\nwhich we determine which stars need to be spectroscopically (re-)measured. Both\ncriteria take the Hipparcos measurement errors into account. For each star in\nthe Hipparcos catalogue, we determine the confidence level with which the\navailable radial velocity and its standard error, taken from the XHIP\ncompilation catalogue, are acceptable. We find that for 97 stars, the radial\nvelocities available in the literature are insufficiently precise for a 68.27%\nconfidence level. We also identify 109 stars for which radial velocities are\ncurrently unknown yet need to be acquired to meet the 68.27% confidence level.\nTo satisfy the radial-velocity requirements coming from our study will be a\ndaunting task consuming a significant amount of spectroscopic telescope time.\nFortunately, the follow-up spectroscopy is not time-critical since the HTPM\nproper motions can be corrected a posteriori once (improved) radial velocities\nbecome available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 07:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-16"}

Our goal is to select k centers in a graph, and assign each\nnode to a nearby center, so that we respect the capacity constraints on\ncenters. The objective is to minimize the maximum distance a node has to travel\nto get to its assigned center. This problem is NP-hard, even when centers have\nno capacity restrictions and optimal factor 2 approximation algorithms are\nknown. With capacities, when all centers have identical capacities, a 6\napproximation is known with no better lower bounds than for the infinite\ncapacity version.\n  While many generalizations and variations of this problem have been studied\nextensively, no progress was made on the capacitated version for a general\ncapacity function. We develop the first constant factor approximation algorithm\nfor this problem. Our algorithm uses an LP rounding approach to solve this\nproblem, and works for the case of non-uniform hard capacities, when multiple\ncopies of a node may not be chosen and can be extended to the case when there\nis a hard bound on the number of copies of a node that may be selected. In\naddition we establish a lower bound on the integrality gap of 7(5) for\nnon-uniform (uniform) hard capacities. In addition we prove that if there is a\n(3-eps)-factor approximation for this problem then P=NP.\n  Finally, for non-uniform soft capacities we present a much simpler\n11-approximation algorithm, which we find as one more evidence that hard\ncapacities are much harder to deal with.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 08:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-16"}

The difficulty is that\ntraditional matrix-vector multiplication style iterative methods may not always\nadapt well to the distributed setting owing to communication bandwidth\nrestrictions and convergence rates.\n  In this paper, we present fast random walk-based distributed algorithms for\ncomputing PageRanks in general graphs and prove strong bounds on the round\ncomplexity.

We show that for a generic class of\nmanifolds, $\\Omega$ is isometric to the wave spectrum $\\Omega_{L_0}$ of the\nminimal Laplacian $L_0=-\\Delta|_{C^\\infty_0(\\Omega\\backslash \\partial \\Omega)}$\nacting in ${\\cal H}=L_2(\\Omega)$, whereas $L_0$ is determined by the inverse\ndata up to unitary equivalence. Hence, the manifold can be recovered (up to\nisometry) by the scheme `data $\\Rightarrow L_0 \\Rightarrow \\Omega_{L_0}\n\\overset{\\rm isom}= \\Omega$'.\n  The wave spectrum is relevant to a wide class of dynamical systems, which\ndescribe the finite speed wave propagation processes.

One of the ways of improving the QoS is\nan efficient scheduling algorithm which incorporates the needs of the users and\nvariation in channel condition. The parameters used to measure the efficiency\nof the scheduling algorithms are the Jain Fairness Index and the overall system\nthroughput. In this paper we have proposed a variance based scheduling\nalgorithm which selects the user who has the highest variance of data\ntransmitted in a given time frame as a parameter for scheduling. This ensures\nthat eventually, the users transmit almost equal amounts of data regardless of\nchannel condition. The simulation results shows that the proposed algorithm\nachieves high Jain Fairness Index of 0.92 with a lesser drop in the system\nthroughput 18% as compared to Dynamically altering Proportionally Fair\nAlgorithm's 20% using the Proportionally Fair Algorithm as reference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 10:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-16"}

Indeed, we give an\nequivalent description of the new definition in terms of the \\textrm{Tor} (or\n\\textrm{Ext}) groups, similar to the existing one for homogeneous algebras, and\nalso a complete characterization of the multi-Koszul property, which derives\nfrom the study of some associated homogeneous algebras, providing a very strong\nlink between the new definition and the generalized Koszul property for the\nassociated homogeneous algebras mentioned before. We further obtain an explicit\ndescription of the Yoneda algebra of a multi-Koszul algebra. As a consequence,\nwe get that the Yoneda algebra of a multi-Koszul algebra is generated in\ndegrees 1 and 2, so a $\\mathcal{K}_{2}$ algebra in the sense of T. Cassidy and\nB. Shelton. We also exhibit several examples and we provide a minimal graded\nprojective resolution of the algebra $A$ considered as an $A$-bimodule, which\nmay be used to compute the Hochschild (co)homology groups. Finally, we find\nnecessary and sufficient conditions on some (fixed) sequences of vector\nsubspaces of the tensor powers of the base space $V$ to obtain in this case the\nmulti-Koszul property in the case we have relations in only two degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 12:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-16"}

Several years ago the pioneering works of T. Asano, J. Matousek and\nT.

An\nimportant member in this family is called \"a zone diagram\". The implicit nature\nof zone diagrams implies, as already observed in the original works, that their\ncomputation is a challenging task. In a continuous setting this task has been\naddressed (briefly) only by these authors in the Euclidean plane with point\nsites. We discuss the possibility to compute zone diagrams in a wide class of\nspaces and also shed new light on their computation in the original setting.\nThe class of spaces, which is introduced here, includes, in particular,\nEuclidean spheres and finite dimensional strictly convex normed spaces. Sites\nof a general form are allowed and it is shown that a generalization of the\niterative method suggested by Asano, Matousek and Tokuyama converges to a\ndouble zone diagram, another implicit geometric object whose existence is known\nin general. Occasionally a zone diagram can be obtained from this procedure.\nThe actual (approximate) computation of the iterations is based on a simple\nalgorithm which enables the approximate computation of Voronoi diagrams in a\ngeneral setting.

These are the regions where the acceleration of the gas takes place and\nthe most recent mass-loss episodes can be seen. We used the HIFI instrument\non-board the Herschel Space Observatory to observe sub-mm and FIR transitions\nof CO, water, and their isotopologues in a sample of two RSGs (NML Cyg and\nBetelgeuse) and two YHGs (IRC+10420 and AFGL 2343) stars. We present an\ninventory of the detected lines and analyse the information revealed by their\nspectral profiles. On the basis of the results presented in an earlier study,\nwe model the CO and 13CO emission in IRC+10420 and compare it to a set of lines\nranging from the mm, to the FIR. Red supergiants have stronger high-excitation\nlines than the YHGs, indicating that they harbour dense and hot inner shells\ncontributing to these transitions. Consequently, these high-J lines in RSGs\noriginate from acceleration layers that have not yet reached the circumstellar\nterminal velocity and have narrower profiles than their flat-topped lower-J\ncounterparts. The YHGs tend to lack this inner component, in line with the\npicture of detached, hollow envelopes derived from studies at longer\nwavelengths. NH3 is only detected in two sources (NML Cyg, IRC+10420), which\nare also observed to be the strongest water-line emitters of the studied\nsample. In contrast, OH is detected in all sources and does not seem to\ncorrelate with the water line intensities. We show that the IRC+10420 model\nderived solely from mm low-J CO transitions is capable of reproducing the\nhigh-J transitions when the temperature in the inner shell is simply lowered by\nabout 30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 15:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

FOCLASA 2012\nwas held in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, on September 8, 2012 as a satellite event\nof CONCUR 2012, the 23rd International Conference on Concurrency Theory. The\nworkshop provides a venue where researchers and practitioners could meet,\nexchange ideas, identify common problems, determine some of the key and\nfundamental issues related to coordination languages and self adaptation, and\nexplore together and disseminate solutions. Indeed, a number of hot research\ntopics are currently sharing the common problem of combining concurrent,\ndistributed, mobile and heterogeneous components, trying to harness the\nintrinsic complexity of the resulting systems. Computation nowadays is becoming\ninherently concurrent, either because of characteristics of the hardware (with\nmulticore processors becoming omnipresent) or due to the ubiquitous presence of\ndistributed systems (incarnated in the Internet). Computational systems are\ntherefore typically distributed, concurrent, mobile, and often involve\ncomposition of heterogeneous components. To specify and reason about such\nsystems and go beyond the functional correctness proofs, e.g., by supporting\nreusability and improving maintainability, approaches such as coordination\nlanguages and self adaptation are recognised as fundamental.\n  This year, we received 13 submissions involving 35 authors from 10 different\ncountries. Papers underwent a rigorous review process, and all accepted papers\nreceived 3 review reports. After the review process, the international Program\nCommittee of FOCLASA 2012 decided to select 8 papers for presentation during\nthe workshop and inclusion in these proceedings.

How should be an answer to this question? At\nthis level, we are so deep that all our concepts are obscure. Quantum theory\n(QT) is at this level. The quest for interpreting it fails because the clarity\nof our actual fundamental concepts in ordinary language cannot match the\nprecision of the theory's mathematical formalism. The interpretation of quantum\nmechanics should define and bring clarity to fundamental concepts; not simply\nrely over them. Quantum theory requires a new worldview, the one that will make\nit understandable. We discuss on the formulation and interpretation of closed,\nand final theories, in other words, completely axiomatic theories that define\ntheir own conceptual framework, and closed theories that cannot be made\nsimpler. We claim that everything we can properly say about a theory follows\nfrom its interpretation, and that interpreting is saying the meaning of each of\nits mathematical statements. We argue that quantum mechanics is a closed\ntheory; and, therefore, that part of it is part of the final or fundamental\ntheory of physics (FTP). We propose a new entirely axiomatic formulation of\npart of quantum theory (including all its mathematical framework) in which new\npowerful and useful elements are added to the existing formalism. Our\ninterpretation is straightforward: it allows us reading or saying the meaning\nof each of the theory's axiom, theorem or element. We state that the proposed\ntheory is the FTP. Its interpretation may dissolve most of the existing\nparadoxes around QT. The principle of excluded middle is not valid in general.\nBoth epistemic and ontic elements are present in the theory since it is a\ntheory of knowledge and truth. This and other fundamental concepts are defined\nby the theory, which can represent both reality and our knowledge about it.\nAesthetics is one of its key features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 03:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 15:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-19"}

Multiple sensors of different gases used\nfor detecting gas mixture of multiple gases, results in cross-sensitivity. The\ncross-sensitivity is a major issue and the problem is viewed as pattern\nrecognition problem. The objective of this article is to present performance\nanalysis of the real valued neuro genetic algorithm which is applied for\nmultiple gas detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 04:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-06"}
