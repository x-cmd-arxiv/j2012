This\nis a physical and feasible scenario since the source satisfies the dominant\nenergy condition. It is possible to realize the geometric flow as a result of\nvariations of the matter content of the brane, actually, as its tensions.\nFurthermore, the Ricci flow defines a family of string-like branes and we\nstudied the effects that the evolution of the transverse space has on the\ngeometric and physical quantities. The geometric flow makes the cosmological\nconstant and the relationship between the Planck masses evolves. The\ngravitational massless mode remains trapped to the brane and the width of the\nmode depends on the evolution parameter. For the Kaluza-Klein modes, the\nasymptotic spectrum of mass is the same as for the thin string-like brane and\nthe analogue Schroedinger potential also changes according to the flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2012 16:39:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2012 19:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-21"}

Thereby the sort of the step can be observed as well\nas its target, a generated subterm. In both systems there are four sorts of\ndecomposition steps: -lambda-> steps (decomposing a lambda-abstraction), -@0>\nand -@1> steps (decomposing an application into its function and argument), and\nrespectively, -del-> steps (delimiting the scope of an abstraction, for\n-reg->), and -S-> (delimiting of scopes, for -reg+->).

A single-hop\nbroadcasting system model is considered that aims to deliver a block of packets\nto all receivers in the presence of packet erasures. For a fair and\nanalytically tractable comparison between the two coding schemes, the\ntransmission comprises two phases: a systematic transmission phase and a\nnetwork coded transmission phase which is further divided into rounds. After\nthe systematic transmission phase and given the same packet reception state,\nthree quantitative metrics are proposed and derived in each scheme: 1) the\nabsolute minimum number of transmissions in the first coded transmission round\n(assuming no erasures), 2) probability distribution of extra coded\ntransmissions in a subsequent round (due to erasures), and 3) average packet\ndecoding delay. This comparative study enables application-aware adaptive\nselection between IDNC and RLNC after systematic transmission phase.\n  One contribution of this paper is to provide a deep and systematic\nunderstanding of the IDNC scheme, to propose the notion of packet diversity and\nan optimal IDNC encoding scheme for minimizing metric 1. This is generally\nNP-hard, but nevertheless required for characterizing and deriving all the\nthree metrics. Analytical and numerical results show that there is no clear\nwinner between RLNC and IDNC if one is concerned with both throughput and\ndecoding delay performance. IDNC is more preferable than RLNC when the number\nof receivers is smaller than packet block size, and the case reverses when the\nnumber of receivers is much greater than the packet block size. In the middle\nregime, the choice can depend on the application and a specific instance of the\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2012 21:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

For decades research\nwas frustrated by poor stoichiometry and the ready reaction of the materials in\nambient conditions, and only recently have these impediments finally been\novercome by advances in thin film fabrication with ultra-high vacuum based\ngrowth technology. Currently, the field of research into the RENs is growing\nrapidly, motivated by the materials demands of proposed electronic and\nspintronic devices. Both semiconducting and ferromagnetic properties have been\nestablished in some of the RENs which thus attract interest for the potential\nto exploit the spin of charge carriers in semiconductor technologies for both\nfundamental and applied science. In this review, we take stock of where\nprogress has occurred within the last decade in both theoretical and\nexperimental fields, and which has led to the point where a proof-of-concept\nspintronic device based on RENs has already been demonstrated. The article is\norganized into three major parts. First, we describe the epitaxial growth of\nREN thin films and their structural properties, with an emphasis on their\nprospective spintronic applications. Then, we conduct a critical review of the\ndifferent advanced theoretical calculations utilised to determine both the\nelectronic structure and the origins of the magnetism in these compounds. The\nrest of the review is devoted to the recent experimental results on optical,\nelectrical and magnetic properties and their relation to current theoretical\ndescriptions. These results are discussed particularly with regard to the\ncontroversy about the exact nature of the magnetic state and conduction\nprocesses in the RENs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2012 07:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-01"}

Although\nthe rates of these systems may be above those of NS-NS mergers, BH-NS and BH-BH\nsystems are difficult to detect, and thusfar none have been observed. But the\nprogenitors of BH-NS and BH-BH binary systems may have been observed, in the\nform of High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs). In this paper, we continue work\nstudying these potential progenitors of these important gravitational wave\nsources. In the first two papers of the series, we have demonstrated that IC10\nX-1 and NGC300 X-1 are direct progenitors of BH-BH systems and that Cyg X-1 may\nform, alas with a very low probability, a BH-NS system. Here, we analyze the\nGalactic binaries GX 301-2, Vela X-1, XTEJ1855-026, 4U1907+09, Cir X-1 and\nextra-galactic LMC X-1, LMC X-3, M33 X-1. In each case, we find that the future\nevolution will not allow the formation of a BH-NS nor a BH-BH system. Most of\nthese binaries will soon merge in the common envelope phase, with a compact\nobject sinking into a helium-rich core of a stellar companion. This\n\"helium-merger\" may be a progenitor for long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).\nBased on the observed HMXB population, the rate of helium-mergers may make up a\nsizable fraction of long-duration GRBs. Due to this high number of potential\nGRB progenitors, a chance that a Galactic HMXB has caused one of the recent\nmajor mass extinction events is significant (10-20%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Aug 2012 11:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-14"}

This sample is enhanced by literature radii measurements\nto form a data set of 33 K-M dwarfs with diameters measured to better than 5%.\nFor all 33 stars, we compute absolute luminosities, linear radii, and effective\ntemperatures (Teff). We develop empirical relations for \\simK0 to M4 main-\nsequence stars between the stellar Teff, radius, and luminosity to broad-band\ncolor indices and metallicity. These relations are valid for metallicities\nbetween [Fe/H] = -0.5 and +0.1 dex, and are accurate to ~2%, ~5%, and ~4% for\nTeff, radius, and luminosity, respectively. Our results show that it is\nnecessary to use metallicity dependent transformations to convert colors into\nstellar Teffs, radii, and luminosities. We find no sensitivity to metallicity\non relations between global stellar properties, e.g., Teff-radius and\nTeff-luminosity. Robust examinations of single star Teffs and radii compared to\nevolutionary model predictions on the luminosity-Teff and luminosity-radius\nplanes reveals that models overestimate the Teffs of stars with Teff < 5000 K\nby ~3%, and underestimate the radii of stars with radii < 0.7 R\\odot by ~5%.\nThese conclusions additionally suggest that the models overestimate the effects\nthat the stellar metallicity may have on the astrophysical properties of an\nobject.
