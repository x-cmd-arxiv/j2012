We\nshow that the problem of choosing leaders in order to minimize this error can\nbe solved using supermodular optimization techniques, leading to efficient\nalgorithms that are within a provable bound of the optimum.

The Fourier-spectrum of the radiation is shown to have a\nsizable intensity well into the GHz frequency range. The emission is mainly due\nto transverse currents induced by the geomagnetic field and to the excess\ncharge produced by the Askaryan effect. At these frequencies only a\nsignificantly reduced volume of the shower around the axis contributes\ncoherently to the signal observed on the ground. The size of the coherently\nemitting volume depends on frequency, shower geometry and observer position,\nand is interpreted in terms of the relative time delays.

We\nhave observed twenty dust-enshrouded AGB stars as part of the Keck Aperture\nMasking Experiment, resolving all of them in multiple near-infrared bands\nbetween 1.5 microns and 3.1 microns. We find 45% of the targets to show\nmeasurable elongations that, when correcting for the greater distances of the\ntargets, would correspond to significantly asymmetric dust shells on par with\nthe well-known cases of IRC+10216 or CIT6. Using radiative transfer models, we\nfind the sublimation temperature of 1130 +- 90 K and 1170 +- 60 K for silicates\nand amorphous carbon respectively, both somewhat lower than expected from\nlaboratory measurements and vastly below temperatures inferred from the inner\nedge of YSO disks. The fact that O-rich and C-rich dust types showed the same\nsublimation temperature was surprising as well. For the most optically-thick\nshells (tau > 2 at 2.2 microns), the temperature profile of the inner dust\nshell is observed to change substantially, an effect we suggest could arise\nwhen individual dust clumps become optically-thick at the highest mass-loss\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Aug 2012 21:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For EPI\ntime series the ACS data is usually acquired once prior to the time series. In\nthis case the interleaved R-shot EPI trajectory, where R is the GRAPPA\nreduction factor, offers advantages which we justify from a theoretical and\nexperimental perspective. Unfortunately, interleaved R-shot ACS can be\ncorrupted due to perturbations to the signal (such as direct and indirect\nmotion effects) occurring between the shots, and these perturbations may lead\nto artifacts in GRAPPA-reconstructed images. Consequently we also present a\nmethod of acquiring interleaved ACS data in a manner which can reduce the\neffects of inter-shot signal perturbations. This method makes use of the phase\ncorrection data, conveniently a part of many standard EPI sequences, to assess\nthe signal perturbations between the segments of R-shot EPI ACS scans. The\nphase correction scans serve as navigator echoes, or more accurately a\nperturbation-sensitive signal, to which a root-mean-square deviation\nperturbation metric is applied for the determination of the best available\ncomplete ACS data set among multiple complete sets of ACS data acquired prior\nto the EPI time series.

In this paper, we study HAP as an\nalternative or complementary fast-evolving technology to provide mobile\nservices in rural areas of emerging countries, where business models need to be\ncarefully tailored to the reality of their related markets. In these large\nareas with low user density, mobile services uptake is likely to be slowed by a\nservice profitability which is in turn limited by a relatively low average\nrevenue per user. Through three architectures enabling different business roles\nand using different terrestrial, HAP and satellite backhaul solutions, we\ndevise how to use in an efficient and profitable fashion these multi-purpose\naerial platforms, in complement to existing access and backhauling satellite or\nterrestrial technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2012 09:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-07"}

A cylindrical tube with, transverse to\nthe background magnetic field, inhomogeneity scale of the order of ion inertial\nlength is considered on which IAWs with frequency $0.3 \\omega_{ci}$ are\nlaunched that are allowed to develop three wavelength. As a result time-varying\nparallel electric fields are generated in the density gradient regions which\naccelerate electrons in the parallel to magnetic field direction. Driven\nperpendicular electric field of IAWs also heats ions in the transverse\ndirection. Such numerical setup is relevant for solar flaring loops and earth\nauroral zone. This first, 3D, fully-kinetic simulation demonstrates electron\nacceleration efficiency in the density inhomogeneity regions, along the\nmagnetic field, of the order of 45% and ion heating, in the transverse to the\nmagnetic field direction, of 75%. The latter is a factor of two times higher\nthan the previous 2.5D analogous study and is in accordance with solar flare\nparticle acceleration observations. We find that the generated parallel\nelectric field is localised in the density inhomogeneity region and rotates in\nthe same direction and with the same angular frequency as the initially\nlaunched IAW. Our numerical simulations seem also to suggest that the \"knee\"\noften found in the solar flare electron spectra can alternatively be\ninterpreted as the Landau damping (Cerenkov resonance effect) of IAWs due to\nthe wave-particle interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Aug 2012 15:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}
