Thus, high spatial resolution\nmultiwavelength studies of nearby Lya emitters, like Haro 2, are highly needed.\nFor that purpose, we have used Chandra X-ray and HST (UV, optical and NIR)\nimages of Haro 2, and STIS and ground-based spectral images along its major and\nminor axes, to characterize the Lya emission and the properties of the stellar\npopulation. The UV, Ha (Halpha) and FIR luminosities of the Haro 2 nuclear\nstarburst are reproduced using evolutionary synthesis models assuming a young\nstellar population with ages ~3.5-5.0 Myr, affected by differential\ninterstellar extinctions. The observed X-ray emission is attributed to gas\nheated by the mechanical energy released by the starburst (soft component) and\na Ultra-Luminous X-ray source candidate (hard). Both compact and diffuse Lya\ncomponents are observed. Whereas Lya is spatially decoupled from Balmer lines\nemission, Balmer decrement and UV continuum, the diffuse Lya component is\nspatially correlated with the diffuse soft X-ray emission. Moreover, unlike the\ncompact one, diffuse Lya shows luminosities larger than predicted from Ha,\nassuming case B recombination and dust extinction as derived from Ha/Hbeta. We\npropose that, whereas the compact Lya emission is associated to the massive\nstellar clusters and is affected by outflows and dust extinction, the diffuse\nLya originates in gas ionized by the hot plasma responsible for the soft X-ray\nradiation, as suggested by their spatial correlation and by the measured\nL(Ha)/LsoftX ratios. Calibration of Lya as star formation rate tracer should\ntherefore include both effects (destruction vs. enhancement) to avoid biases in\nthe study of galaxies at cosmological distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 16:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The\nmodel is considered for a thin TiO_2 film containing a region which is highly\nself-doped with oxygen vacancies and a region which is less doped, i.e., a\nsingle-phase material with a built-in chemical inhomogeneity sandwiched between\ntwo platinum electrodes. On base of the proposed model, Strukov et al. [1] were\nable to obtain the characteristic dynamical state equation and current-voltage\nrelation for a genuine memristor. However, some fundamental facts of\nelectrochemistry have been overlooked by the authors while putting forward\ntheir model, namely the coupling of diffusion currents at the boundary between\nboth regions. The device will operate for a certain time like a \"chemical\ncapacitor\" until the chemical inhomogeneity is balanced out, thus violating the\nessential requirement on a genuine memristor, the so-called \"no energy\ndischarge property\". Moreover, the dynamical state equation for the\nHP-memristor device must fail as this relation violates by itself Landauer's\nprinciple of the minimum energy costs for information processing. Maybe, such\nan approach might be upheld if one introduces an additional prerequisite by\nspecifying the minimum amount of electric power input to the device which is\nrequired to continuously change internal, physical states of the considered\nsystem.

Although the production of both 17O\nand 18O are related to the metallicity of progenitor stars, 17O is most likely\nproduced in stars that evolve on longer timescales than those that produce 18O.\nTherefore the 17O/18O ratio need not have remained constant over time, contrary\nto preconceptions and the simplest models of GCE. An apparent linear, slope-one\ncorrelation between delta17O and delta18O in the ISM need not necessarily\nreflect an O isotopic gradient, and any slope-one galactocentric gradient need\nnot correspond to evolution in time. Instead, increasing 17O/18O is consistent\nboth with observational data from molecular clouds and with modeling of the\ncompositions of presolar grains. Models in which the rate of star formation has\ndecelerated over the past few Gyr or in which an enhanced period of star\nformation occurred shortly before solar birth (\"starburst\") can explain the\nsolar-ISM O-isotopic difference without requiring a local input of supernova\nejecta into the protosolar cloud. \"Cosmic chemical memory\" models in which\ninterstellar dust is on average older than interstellar gas predict that\nprimordial Solar System solids should be 16O-rich, relative to the Sun, in\nconflict with observations. However, scenarios in which the 16O-rich\ncontribution of very massive stars could lead to 16O-poor solids and a 16O-rich\nbulk Sun, if the Solar System formed shortly after a starburst, independent of\nthe popular scenario of photochemical self-shielding of CO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 18:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Our formulation of\nthe disc wind problem is in the spirit of the original Parker (1958) and Bondi\n(1952) problems, namely we assume an elementary flow configuration consisting\nof an outflow following pre-defined trajectories in the presence of a central\ngravitating point mass. Viscosity and heat conduction are neglected. We\nconsider two different streamline geometries, both comprised of straight lines\nin the (x,z)-plane: (i) streamlines that converge to a geometric point located\nat (x,z)=(0,-d) and (ii) streamlines that emerge at a constant inclination\nangle from the disc midplane (the x-axis, as we consider geometrically thin\naccretion discs). The former geometry is commonly used in kinematic models to\ncompute synthetic spectra, while the latter, which exhibits self-similarity, is\nlikely unused for this purpose, although it easily can be with existing\nkinematic models. We make the case that it should be, i.e. that geometry (ii)\nleads to transonic wind solutions with substantially different properties owing\nto its lack of streamline divergence. Both geometries can be used to complement\nrecent efforts to estimate photoevaporative mass loss rates from protoplanetary\ndiscs. Pertinent to understanding our disc wind results, which are also\napplicable to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, is a focused\ndiscussion on lesser known properties of classic Parker wind solutions. We find\nthat the parameter space corresponding to decelerating Parker wind solutions is\nmade larger due to rotation and leads instead to disc wind solutions that\nalways accelerate after the bulk velocity is slowed to a minimum value.\nSurprisingly, Keplerian rotation may allow for two different transonic wind\nsolutions for the same physical conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 19:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Several special types of\nrecurrent configurations and their properties via this bijection are examined.\nFor example, recurrent configurations whose sum of heights is minimal are shown\nto correspond to polyominoes of least area. Two other classes of recurrent\nconfigurations are shown to be related to bicomposition matrices, a matrix\nanalogue of set partitions, and (2+2)-free partially ordered sets.\n  A canonical toppling process for recurrent configurations gives rise to a\npath within the associated parallelogram polyominoes.

Here we report on the experimental realization of opto-electrical\ncooling, a paradigm-changing cooling and accumulation method for polar\nmolecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule's\nkinetic energy in each step of the cooling cycle via a Sisyphus effect,\nallowing cooling with only few dissipative decay processes. We demonstrate its\npotential by reducing the temperature of about 10^6 trapped CH_3F molecules by\na factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 or a\nfactor of 70 discounting trap losses. In contrast to other cooling mechanisms,\nour scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions, and works for a\nlarge variety of polar molecules.

We discuss sources of statistical and systematic noise, calibration,\ntelescope pointing, and data selection. Out of 1260 survey hours and 1024\ndetectors per array, 816 hours and 593 effective detectors remain after data\nselection for this frequency band, yielding a 38% survey efficiency. The total\nsensitivity in 2008, determined from the noise level between 5 Hz and 20 Hz in\nthe time-ordered data stream (TOD), is 32 micro-Kelvin sqrt{s} in CMB units.\nAtmospheric brightness fluctuations constitute the main contaminant in the data\nand dominate the detector noise covariance at low frequencies in the TOD. The\nmaps were made by solving the least-squares problem using the Preconditioned\nConjugate Gradient method, incorporating the details of the detector and noise\ncorrelations. Cross-correlation with WMAP sky maps, as well as analysis from\nsimulations, reveal that our maps are unbiased at multipoles ell > 300. This\npaper accompanies the public release of the 148 GHz southern stripe maps from\n2008. The techniques described here will be applied to future maps and data\nreleases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jul 2012 22:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Aug 2012 22:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Motivated by previous work on\nE/B-mode separation with shear two-point correlation functions and the\npractical considerations of data analysis, I consider E/B-mode estimators which\nare linear combinations of the binned shear correlation function data points. I\ndemonstrate that these estimators mix E- and B-modes generally. I then show how\nto define estimators which minimize this E/B-mode mixing and give practical\nrecipes for their construction and use. Using these optimal estimators, I\ndemonstrate that the vector space composed of the binned shear correlation\nfunction data points can be decomposed into approximately ambiguous, E- and\nB-mode subspaces. With simple Fisher information estimates, I show that a\nnon-trivial amount of information on typical cosmological parameters is\ncontained in the ambiguous mode subspace computed in this formalism. Next, I\ngive two examples which apply these practical estimators and recipes to generic\nproblems in cosmic shear data analysis: data compression and spatially locating\nB-mode contamination. In particular, by using wavelet-like estimators with the\nshear correlation functions directly, one can pinpoint B-mode contamination to\nspecific angular scales and extract information on its shape. Finally, I\ndiscuss how these estimators can be used as part of blinded or closed-box\ncosmic shear data analyses in order to assess and find B-mode contamination at\nhigh-precision while avoiding observer biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 02:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

It works by injecting random\nnoise into each query result, such that it is provably hard for the adversary\nto infer the presence or absence of any individual record from the published\nnoisy results. The main objective in differentially private query processing is\nto maximize the accuracy of the query results, while satisfying the privacy\nguarantees. Previous work, notably the matrix mechanism, has suggested that\nprocessing a batch of correlated queries as a whole can potentially achieve\nconsiderable accuracy gains, compared to answering them individually. However,\nas we point out in this paper, the matrix mechanism is mainly of theoretical\ninterest; in particular, several inherent problems in its design limit its\naccuracy in practice, which almost never exceeds that of naive methods. In\nfact, we are not aware of any existing solution that can effectively optimize a\nquery batch under differential privacy. Motivated by this, we propose the\nLow-Rank Mechanism (LRM), the first practical differentially private technique\nfor answering batch queries with high accuracy, based on a low rank\napproximation of the workload matrix. We prove that the accuracy provided by\nLRM is close to the theoretical lower bound for any mechanism to answer a batch\nof queries under differential privacy.

Such models must be integrated\nstarting from an assumed initial state, which is typically taken to be a\nwind-free, rest state. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of hot-Jupiter\natmospheric circulation models to initial conditions. We consider two classes\nof models--shallow-water models, which have proven successful at illuminating\nthe dynamical mechanisms at play on these planets, and full three-dimensional\nmodels similar to those being explored in the literature. Models are\ninitialized with zonal jets, and we explore a variety of different initial jet\nprofiles. We demonstrate that, in both classes of models, the final,\nequilibrated state is independent of initial condition--as long as frictional\ndrag near the bottom of the domain and/or interaction with a specified\nplanetary interior are included so that the atmosphere can adjust angular\nmomentum over time relative to the interior. When such mechanisms are included,\notherwise identical models initialized with vastly different initial conditions\nall converge to the same statistical steady state. In some cases, the models\nexhibit modest time variability; this variability results in random\nfluctuations about the statistical steady state, but we emphasize that, even in\nthese cases, the statistical steady state itself does not depend on initial\nconditions. Although the outcome of hot-Jupiter circulation models depend on\ndetails of the radiative forcing and frictional drag, aspects of which remain\nuncertain, we conclude that the specification of initial conditions is not a\nsource of uncertainty, at least over the parameter range explored in most\ncurrent models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 07:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2013 06:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-12"}

Generalization of this measure to three genomes is known as the\nmedian score (while a resulting genome is called median genome). In contrast to\nthe rearrangement distance between two genomes which can be computed in linear\ntime, computing the median score for three genomes is NP-hard. This inspires a\nquest for simpler and faster approximations for the median score, the most\nnatural of which appears to be the halved sum of pairwise distances which in\nfact represents a lower bound for the median score.\n  In this work, we study relationship and interplay of pairwise distances\nbetween three genomes and their median score under the model of\nDouble-Cut-and-Join (DCJ) rearrangements. Most remarkably we show that while a\nrearrangement may change the sum of pairwise distances by at most 2 (and thus\nchange the lower bound by at most 1), even the most \"powerful\" rearrangements\nin this respect that increase the lower bound by 1 (by moving one genome\nfarther away from each of the other two genomes), which we call strong, do not\nnecessarily affect the median score. This observation implies that the two\nmeasures are not as well-correlated as one's intuition may suggest.\n  We further prove that the median score attains the lower bound exactly on the\ntriples of genomes that can be obtained from a single genome with strong\nrearrangements. While the sum of pairwise distances with the factor 2/3\nrepresents an upper bound for the median score, its tightness remains unclear.\nNonetheless, we show that the difference of the median score and its lower\nbound is not bounded by a constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 08:20:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2012 21:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

In a realistic spectrum trading market, the\nrequests from secondary users often specify the usage of a fixed spectrum\nfrequency band in a certain geographical region and require a duration time in\na fixed available time interval. Considering the selfish behaviors of secondary\nusers, it is imperative to design a truthful auction which matches the\navailable spectrums and requests of secondary users optimally. Unfortunately,\nexisting designs either do not consider spectrum heterogeneity or ignore the\ndifferences of required time among secondary users. In this paper, we address\nthis problem by investigating how to use auction mechanisms to allocate and\nprice spectrum resources so that the social efficiency can be maximized. We\nbegin by classifying the spectrums and requests from secondary users into\ndifferent local markets which ensures there is no interference between local\nmarkets, and then we can focus on the auction in a single local market. We\nfirst design an optimal auction based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)\nmechanism to maximize the social efficiency while enforcing truthfulness. To\nreduce the computational complexity, we further propose a truthful sub-optimal\nauction with polynomial time complexity, which yields an approximation factor\n6+4\\surd2. Our extensive simulation results using real spectrum availability\ndata show that the social efficiency ratio of the sub-optimal auction is always\nabove 70% compared with the optimal auction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 09:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-02"}

The XMM-Newton spectra taken during the\ndecline then trace luminosities of 0.86-0.27 L_Edd. These spectra are all\ndominated by a hot disc component, which roughly follows a constant inner\nradius track in luminosity and temperature as the source declines. At the\nhighest luminosity the disc structure should change due to advection of\nradiation through the disc. This advected flux can be partly released at lower\nradii thus modifying the spectral shape. To study the effect of advection at\nluminosities close to Eddington we employ a fully relativistic slim disc model,\nSLIMBH, that includes advective cooling and full radiative transfer through the\nphotosphere based on TLUSTY. The model also incorporates relativistic photon\nray-tracing from the proper location of the disc photosphere rather than the\nmid-plane as the slim disc is no longer geometrically thin. We find that these\nnew models differ only slightly from the non-advective (standard) BHSPEC models\neven at the highest luminosities considered here. While both discs can fit the\nhighest luminosity data, neither is a very good fit to the *lower*\nluminosities. This could indicate a missing physical process that acts in low\nluminosity discs and subsides as the disc luminosity approaches the Eddington\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 10:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 11:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

While gene expression is often\nhighly erratic, embryonic development is usually exceedingly precise. In\nparticular, gene expression boundaries are robust not only against intrinsic\nnoise from gene expression and protein diffusion, but also against\nembryo-to-embryo variations in the morphogen gradients, which provide\npositional information to the differentiating cells. How development is robust\nagainst intra- and inter-embryonic variations is not understood. A common motif\nin the gene regulation networks that control embryonic development is mutual\nrepression between pairs of genes. To assess the role of mutual repression in\nthe robust formation of gene expression patterns, we have performed large-scale\nstochastic simulations of a minimal model of two mutually repressing gap genes\nin Drosophila, hunchback (hb) and knirps (kni). Our model includes not only\nmutual repression between hb and kni, but also the stochastic and cooperative\nactivation of hb by the anterior morphogen Bicoid (Bcd) and of kni by the\nposterior morphogen Caudal (Cad), as well as the diffusion of Hb and Kni. Our\nanalysis reveals that mutual repression can markedly increase the steepness and\nprecision of the gap gene expression boundaries. In contrast to spatial\naveraging and cooperative gene activation, mutual repression thus allows for\ngene-expression boundaries that are both steep and precise. Moreover, mutual\nrepression dramatically enhances their robustness against embryo-to-embryo\nvariations in the morphogen levels. Finally, our simulations reveal that gap\nprotein diffusion plays a critical role not only in reducing the width of gap\ngene expression boundaries via spatial averaging, but also in repairing\npatterning errors that could arise due to the bistability induced by mutual\nrepression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 10:15:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Aug 2012 11:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We find that the defects originate from a local\nincrease of a GaAs layer thickness. Modulation heights of up to 140nm for oval\ndefects and 90nm for round defects are found, while the lateral extension is\nabout 2um for oval and 4um for round defects. The GaAs thickness increase is\nattributed to Ga droplets deposited during growth due to Ga cell spitting.\nFollowing the droplet deposition, the thickness modulation expands laterally\nwhile reducing its height, yielding oval to round mounds of the interfaces and\nthe surface. With increasing growth temperature, the ellipticity of the mounds\nis decreasing and their size is increasing. This suggests that the expansion is\nrelated to the surface mobility of Ga, which with increasing temperature is\nincreasing and reducing its anisotropy between the [110] and [1-10]\ncrystallographic directions.

In\ncounting, nodes must determine the size of the network n and in naming they\nmust end up with unique identities. By anonymous we mean that all nodes begin\nfrom identical states apart possibly from a unique leader node and by unknown\nthat nodes have no a priori knowledge of the network (apart from some minimal\nknowledge when necessary) including ignorance of n. Network dynamicity is\nmodeled by the 1-interval connectivity model, in which communication is\nsynchronous and a worst-case adversary chooses the edges of every round subject\nto the condition that each instance is connected. We first focus on static\nnetworks with broadcast where we prove that, without a leader, counting is\nimpossible to solve and that naming is impossible to solve even with a leader\nand even if nodes know n. These impossibilities carry over to dynamic networks\nas well. We also show that a unique leader suffices in order to solve counting\nin linear time. Then we focus on dynamic networks with broadcast. We conjecture\nthat dynamicity renders nontrivial computation impossible. In view of this, we\nlet the nodes know an upper bound on the maximum degree that will ever appear\nand show that in this case the nodes can obtain an upper bound on n. Finally,\nwe replace broadcast with one-to-each, in which a node may send a different\nmessage to each of its neighbors. Interestingly, this natural variation is\nproved to be computationally equivalent to a full-knowledge model, in which\nunique names exist and the size of the network is known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 12:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-02"}

However, these nodes may not be appropriate relay\ncandidates for some target nodes, because they may have low importance relative\nto these subsets of target nodes.

We design a new\nopportunistic forwarding scheme, opportunistic forwarding with partial\ncentrality (OFPC), and theoretically quantify the influence of the partial\ncentrality on the data forwarding performance using graph spectrum.

Previous analysis of this cluster revealed a large\ndispersion in the line strength of the infrared Ca II triplet, suggesting an\nintrinsic star-to-star scatter in its Fe or Ca content. From our analysis, we\nassess that all the investigated stars share the same [Fe/H], [Ca/Fe] and\n[Ti/Fe] abundance ratios, while a large spread in Mg and K abundances is\ndetected. The distribution of [Mg/Fe] is bimodal, with ~40% of the observed\ntargets having subsolar [Mg/Fe], down to [Mg/Fe] ~ -1 dex, a level of\nMg-deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. It is found that the\nlarge dispersion in Mg abundances is likely the main origin of the observed\ndispersion of the Ca II triplet lines strengths (that can be erroneously\ninterpreted in terms of Fe or Ca abundance scatter) because Mg plays a relevant\nrole in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron donor. A strong depletion\nin the Mg abundance leads to an increase of the line strength of the Ca II\ntriplet, due to the variation in the electronic pressure, at a constant Fe and\nCa abundance. Finally, we detect an anti-correlation between Mg and K\nabundances, not easily explainable within the framework of the current\nnucleosynthesis models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 12:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Given the age of the system, this\nplanet should have been tidally circularized a long time ago. Many attempts to\nexplain this were proposed in recent years, either involving abnormally weak\ntides, or the perturbing action of a distant companion. We address here the\nlatter issue based on Kozai migration. We propose that GJ 436b was formerly\nlocated further away from the star and that it underwent a migration induced by\na massive, inclined perturber via Kozai mechanism. In this context, the\nperturbations by the companion trigger high amplitude variations to GJ 436b\nthat cause tides to act at periastron. Then the orbit tidally shrinks to reach\nits present day location. We numerically integrate the 3-body system including\ntides and General Relativity correction. We first show that starting from the\npresent-day location of GJ 436b inevitably leads to damping the Kozai\noscillations and to rapidly circularizing the planet. Conversely, starting from\n5-10 times further away allows the onset of Kozai cycles. The tides act in peak\neccentricity phases and reduce the semi-major axis of the planet. The net\nresult is an evolution characterized by two phases: a first one with Kozai\ncycles and a slowly shrinking semi-major axis, and a second one once the planet\ngets out of the Kozai resonance characterized by a more rapid decrease. The\ntimescale of this process appears in most cases much longer than the standard\ncircularization time of the planet by a factor larger than 50. This model can\nprovide a solution to the eccentricity paradox of GJ 436b. Depending on the\nvarious orbital configurations, it can take several Gyrs to GJ 436b to achieve\na full orbital decrease and circularization. According to this scenario, we\ncould be witnessing today the second phase of the scenario where the semi-major\naxis is already reduced while the eccentricity is still significant. We then\nexplore the parameter space and derive in which conditions this model can be\nrealistic given the age of the system. This yields constraints on the\ncharacteristics of the putative companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 14:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

From measurements of the\nresistive and bulk transitions to superconductivity in these materials, we find\nthat the resistive transition appears at a temperature considerably higher than\nthe bulk transition when superconductivity and magnetic order coexist, but this\ntemperature difference disappears in the absence of long-range magnetic order.\nFurther, in the pressure-temperature region of coexistence in CeRhIn5, a new\nanisotropy in the resistive transition develops even though the tetragonal\ncrystal structure apparently remains unchanged, implying a form of textured\nsuperconductivity. We suggest that this texture may be a generic response to\ncoexisting order in these and other heavy-fermion superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 15:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The leak can have a natural origin, it\ncan mimic measurement devices, and it can also be used to reveal dynamical\nproperties of the closed system. In this paper we provide an unified treatment\nof leaking systems and we review applications to different physical problems,\nboth in the classical and quantum pictures. Our treatment is based on the\ntransient chaos theory of open systems, which is essential because real leaks\nhave finite size and therefore estimations based on the closed system differ\nessentially from observations. The field of applications reviewed is very\nbroad, ranging from planetary astronomy and hydrodynamical flows, to plasma\nphysics and quantum fidelity. The theory is expanded and adapted to the case of\npartial leaks (partial absorption/transmission) with applications to room\nacoustics and optical microcavities in mind. Simulations in the lima .con\nfamily of billiards illustrate the main text. Regarding billiard dynamics, we\nemphasize that a correct discrete time representation can only be given in\nterms of the so- called true-time maps, while traditional Poincar \\'e maps lead\nto erroneous results. We generalize Perron-Frobenius-type operators so that\nthey describe true-time maps with partial leaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2012 15:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 21:09:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2013 12:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-07"}
