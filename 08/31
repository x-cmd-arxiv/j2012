The variability originates in\nthe disc as mass-accretion fluctuations and propagates through the disc to\n'light up' inner disc regions, eventually modulating the power-law emission\nthat is produced relatively centrally.\n  We present a comparative spectral-timing study of XMM-Newton data from the\nBHXRB SWIFT J1753.5-0127 in a bright 2009 hard state with that from the\nsignificantly fainter 2006 hard state, to show for the first time the change in\ndisc spectral-timing properties associated with a global increase in both the\naccretion rate and the relative contribution of the disc emission to the\nbolometric luminosity.\n  We show that, although there is strong evidence for intrinsic disc\nvariability in the more luminous hard state, the disc variability amplitude is\nsuppressed relative to that of the power-law emission, which contrasts with the\nbehaviour at lower luminosities where the disc variability is slightly enhanced\nwhen compared with the power-law variations. In the higher-luminosity data, the\ndisc variability below 0.6 keV becomes incoherent with the power-law and\nhigher-energy disc emission at frequencies below 0.5 Hz, in contrast with the\ncoherent variations seen in the 2006 data.\n  We explain these differences and the associated complex lags in the 2009 data\nin terms of the fluctuating disc model. If the variable signals are generated\nat small radii in the disc, the variability of disc emission can be naturally\nsuppressed by the fraction of unmodulated disc emission from larger radii. The\ndrop in coherence can be produced by disc accretion fluctuations arising at\nlarger radii which are viscously damped and hence unable to propagate to the\ninner, power-law emitting region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 16:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In the absence of\ngravitational interactions between the stars, two evolutionary modes are found:\n(1) nearly uniform precession of S about the total angular momentum vector of\nthe system; (2) damped precession, leading, in less than one precessional\nperiod, to alignment of S with the angular momentum of the rotating cluster.\nBeyond a certain distance from the SBH, the time scale for angular momentum\nchanges due to gravitational encounters between the stars is shorter than\nspin-orbit precession times. We present a model, based on the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck equation, for the stochastic evolution of star clusters due\nto gravitational encounters and use it to evaluate the evolution of S in nuclei\nwhere changes in the Lj are due to frame dragging close to the SBH and to\nencounters farther out. Long-term evolution in this case is well described as\nuniform precession of the SBH about the cluster's rotational axis, with an\nincreasingly important stochastic contribution when SBH masses are small. Spin\nprecessional periods are predicted to be strongly dependent on nuclear\nproperties, but typical values are 10-100 Myr for low-mass SBHs in dense\nnuclei, 100 Myr - 10 Gyr for intermediate mass SBHs, and > 10 Gyr for the most\nmassive SBHs. We compare the evolution of SBH spins in stellar nuclei to the\ncase of torquing by an inclined, gaseous accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 19:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

We\nstudy the modified Landau problem for both Schr\\\"odinger and Dirac particles,\nwhose Hamiltonians are obtained through a kind of non-Abelian Bopp's shift of\nthe dynamical variables from the ones of the usual problem in the normal space.\nThe spectrum of these models are considered in perturbation theory, both for\nsmall and large noncommutativity parameters. We find no constraint between the\nparameters referring to no-commutativity in coordinates and momenta but they\nrather play similar roles. Since the representation space of the unitary\nirreducible representations SL(2,R) can be realized in terms of spaces of\nsquare-integrable functions, we conclude that these models are equivalent to\nquantum mechanical models of particles living in a space with an additional\ncompact dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 21:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Oct 2012 15:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-30"}

The design of standard backoff protocol allows already\nsuccessful nodes to remain successful, giving little chance to those nodes that\nfailed to capture the channel in the beginning.

Our real-life measurements using\ncommodity hardware demonstrate that in many settings such mechanism not only\nallows to achieve better throughput, but also assures nearly perfect fairness.\nWe further corroborate these results with simulations and an analytical model.\nFinally, we present a backoff factor selection protocol which can be\nimplemented in access points to enable deployment of the penalty backoff\nprotocol to consumer devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 21:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 19:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2013 20:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-13"}

The critical aim of our work is to\nclose the knowledge gap about the adoption of a multi-band uncertainty set in\nRobust Optimization: a general definition and intensive theoretical study of a\nmulti-band model are actually still missing. Our new developments have been\nalso strongly inspired and encouraged by our industrial partners, which have\nbeen interested in getting a better modeling of arbitrary distributions, built\non historical data of the uncertainty affecting the considered real-world\nproblems. In this paper, we study the robust counterpart of a Linear\nProgramming Problem with uncertain coefficient matrix, when a multi-band\nuncertainty set is considered.

First, paths for\nanonymous communication are built without considering trust relationships\nbetween users and relays in the system. Second, the network architecture relies\non a set of centralized servers. In this paper, we propose Pisces, a\ndecentralized protocol for anonymous communications that leverages users'\nsocial links to build circuits for onion routing. We argue that such an\napproach greatly improves the system's resilience to attackers.\n  A fundamental challenge in this setting is the design of a secure process to\ndiscover peers for use in a user's circuit. All existing solutions for secure\npeer discovery leverage structured topologies and cannot be applied to\nunstructured social network topologies. In Pisces, we discover peers by using\nrandom walks in the social network graph with a bias away from highly connected\nnodes to prevent a few nodes from dominating the circuit creation process. To\nsecure the random walks, we leverage the reciprocal neighbor policy: if\nmalicious nodes try to exclude honest nodes during peer discovery so as to\nimprove the chance of being selected, then honest nodes can use a tit-for-tat\napproach and reciprocally exclude the malicious nodes from their routing\ntables. We describe a fully decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy,\nand use it to build the Pisces anonymity system.\n  Using theoretical modeling and experiments on real-world social network\ntopologies, we show that (a) the reciprocal neighbor policy mitigates active\nattacks that an adversary can perform, (b) our decentralized protocol to\nenforce this policy is secure and has low overhead, and (c) the overall\nanonymity provided by our system significantly outperforms existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 22:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-03"}

If otherwise, it is called\nsingular. In regular statistical models, the Bayes free energy, which is\ndefined by the minus logarithm of Bayes marginal likelihood, can be\nasymptotically approximated by the Schwarz Bayes information criterion (BIC),\nwhereas in singular models such approximation does not hold.\n  Recently, it was proved that the Bayes free energy of a singular model is\nasymptotically given by a generalized formula using a birational invariant, the\nreal log canonical threshold (RLCT), instead of half the number of parameters\nin BIC. Theoretical values of RLCTs in several statistical models are now being\ndiscovered based on algebraic geometrical methodology. However, it has been\ndifficult to estimate the Bayes free energy using only training samples,\nbecause an RLCT depends on an unknown true distribution.\n  In the present paper, we define a widely applicable Bayesian information\ncriterion (WBIC) by the average log likelihood function over the posterior\ndistribution with the inverse temperature $1/\\log n$, where $n$ is the number\nof training samples. We mathematically prove that WBIC has the same asymptotic\nexpansion as the Bayes free energy, even if a statistical model is singular for\nand unrealizable by a statistical model.

Each noise contribution to the visibility data is\nassociated with a relevant correlation timescale and frequency bandwidth so\nthat the net impact on a complete observation can be assessed. All quantities\nare parameterised as function of observing frequency and the visibility\nbaseline length. We apply the resulting noise budget analysis to a wide range\nof existing and planned telescope systems that will operate between about 100\nMHz and 5 GHz to ascertain the magnitude of the calibration challenges that\nthey must overcome to achieve thermal noise limited performance. We conclude\nthat calibration challenges are increased in several respects by small\ndimensions of the dishes or aperture array stations. It will be more\nchallenging to achieve thermal noise limited performance using 15 m class\ndishes rather than the 25 m dishes of current arrays. Some of the performance\nrisks are mitigated by the deployment of phased array feeds and more with the\nchoice of an (alt,az,pol) mount, although a larger dish diameter offers the\nbest prospects for risk mitigation. Many improvements to imaging performance\ncan be anticipated at the expense of greater complexity in calibration\nalgorithms. However, a fundamental limitation is ultimately imposed by an\ninsufficient number of data constraints relative to calibration variables.

We analyze the effectiveness of such error suppression techniques\nand identify critical constraints on the performance of error suppression in\nAQC, suggesting that error suppression by itself is insufficient for\nfault-tolerant, large-scale AQC and that a form of error correction is needed.\n  This manuscript has been superseded by the articles, \"Error suppression and\nerror correction in adiabatic quantum computation I: techniques and\nchallenges,\" arXiv:1307.5893, and \"Error suppression and error correction in\nadiabatic quantum computation II: non-equilibrium dynamics,\" arXiv:1307.5892.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 05:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 18:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-20"}

Theoretical studies and models\nbased on the concepts of collective dynamics in complex systems,\nreaction-diffusion processes and emergent phenomena were proposed to explain\nsome of these behaviors. In the particular case of microtubule spatial\nself-organization, it has been advanced that microtubules could behave like\nants, self-organizing by 'talking to each other' by way of hypothetic (because\nnever observed) concentrated chemical trails of tubulin that are expected to be\nreleased by their disassembling ends. Deterministic models based on this idea\nyielded indeed like-looking spatio-temporal self-organizing behaviors.\nNevertheless the question remains of whether microscopic tubulin trails\nproduced by individual or bundles of several microtubules are intense enough to\nallow microtubule self-organization at a macroscopic level. In the present\nwork, by simulating the diffusion of tubulin in microtubule solutions at the\nmicroscopic scale, we measure the shape and intensity of tubulin trails and\ndiscuss about the assumption of microtubule self-organization due to the\nproduction of chemical trails by disassembling microtubules. We show that the\ntubulin trails produced by individual microtubules or small microtubule arrays\nare very weak and not elongated even at very high reactive rates. Although the\nvariations of concentration due to such trails are not significant compared to\nnatural fluctuations of the concentration of tubuline in the chemical\nenvironment, the study shows that heterogeneities of biochemical composition\ncan form due to microtubule disassembly. They could become significant when\nproduced by numerous microtubule ends located in the same place. Their possible\nformation could play a role in certain conditions of reaction. In particular,\nit gives a mesoscopic basis to explain the collective dynamics observed in\nexcitable microtubule solutions showing the propagation of concentration waves\nof microtubules at the millimeter scale, although we doubt that individual\nmicrotubules or bundles can behave like molecular ants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 06:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-03"}

In this paper, we\napply the AG method to various SLM schemes which are the conventional SLM\nscheme and its low-complexity versions such as Lim's, Wang's, and Baxely's SLM\nschemes. Of course, the AG method can be applied to most of existing SLM\nschemes easily.

The breakup coupling in both\nthe elastic scattering and in the fusion process induced by weakly bound stable\nprojectiles is also shown to be crucial.

We aim to develope a model that fits the observed\nSNIa progenitors as well as the observed close double white dwarf population.\nWe differentiate between two scenarios for the common envelope (CE) evolution;\nthe alpha-formalism based on the energy equation and the gamma-formalism that\nis based on the angular momentum equation. In one model we apply the\nalpha-formalism always. In the second model the gamma-formalism is applied,\nunless the binary contains a compact object or the CE is triggered by a tidal\ninstability for which the alpha-formalism is used. The binary population\nsynthesis code SeBa was used to evolve binary systems from the zero-age main\nsequence to the formation of double white dwarfs and subsequent mergers. SeBa\nhas been thoroughly updated since the last publication of the content of the\ncode. The limited sample of observed double white dwarfs is better represented\nby the simulated population using the gamma-formalism than the alpha-formalism.\nFor both CE formalisms, we find that although the morphology of the simulated\ndelay time distribution matches that of the observations within the errors, the\nnormalisation and time-integrated rate per stellar mass are a factor 7-12 lower\nthan observed.

In all cases the flame initially propagates without acceleration at a\nvelocity close to the laminar flame speed. The flame configuration excludes\nmost of conventionally acknowledged phenomena of the DDT, namely, volumetric\nexplosions, igniting shock and shock waves interactions. However, after an\ninduction period, of the order of 1 sec, the flame accelerates more than 100\ntimes, within a period of 3-30 ms, until the steady-state choked regime is\nestablished.

We establish explicit\nexpressions for the rates and the efficiency (final donor-acceptor population\ndifference) of the reaction. In particular, we show that the rate increases for\na multi-level acceptor, but the efficiency does not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 14:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2012 12:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-05"}

We select 23,883\nquiescent luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the SDSS DR7 and divide them into\nfour sub-samples according to their velocity dispersions and each sub-sample is\nfurther divided into 12 redshift bins. The spectra of the LRGs in each redshift\nand velocity bin are co-added in order to obtain a combined spectrum with\nrelatively high $S/N$. Adopting the GalexEV/SteLib model, we estimate the mean\nages of the LRGs from these combined spectra by the full-spectrum fitting\nmethod. We check the reliability of the estimated age by using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and find that the estimates are robust and reliable. Assuming that\nthe LRGs in each sub-sample and each redshift bin were on average formed at the\nsame time, the Hubble parameter at the present time $H_0$ is estimated from the\nage--redshift relation obtained for each sub-sample, which is compatible with\nthe $H_0$ value measured by other methods. We demonstrate that a systematic\nbias (up to $\\sim 20%$) may be introduced to the $H_0$ estimation because of\nrecent star formation in the LRGs due to the later major mergers at $z\\la 0.4$,\nbut this bias may be negligible for those sub-samples with large velocity\ndispersions. Using the age--redshift relations obtained from the sub-sample\nwith the largest velocity dispersion or the two sub-samples with high velocity\ndispersions, we find $H_0= 65^{+7}_{-3}\\kmsmpc$ or $H_0= 74^{+5}_{-4}\\kmsmpc$\nby assuming a spatially flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

A\nstrong heating of electrons and ionization in the plasma bulk due to high bulk\nelectric fields are observed at distinct times within the RF period. Based on\nthe model the electric field is identified to be a drift field caused by a low\nelectrical conductivity due to the high electron-neutral collision frequency at\natmospheric pressure. Thus, the ionization is mainly caused by ohmic heating in\nthis \"Omega-mode\". The phase of strongest bulk electric field and ionization is\naffected by the driving voltage amplitude. At high amplitudes, the plasma\ndensity is high, so that the sheath impedance is comparable to the bulk\nresistance. Thus, voltage and current are about 45{\\deg} out of phase and\nmaximum ionization is observed during sheath expansion with local maxima at the\nsheath edges. At low driving voltages, the plasma density is low and the\ndischarge becomes more resistive resulting in a smaller phase shift of about\n4{\\deg}. Thus, maximum ionization occurs later within the RF period with a\nmaximum in the discharge center. Significant analogies to electronegative low\npressure macroscopic discharges operated in the Drift-Ambipolar mode are found,\nwhere similar mechanisms induced by a high electronegativity instead of a high\ncollision frequency have been identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 15:13:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2013 11:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-03"}

However, accurate predictions\nrequire some fine-tuning of the model parameters. This task can be simplified\nby studying several entrance channels, which populate different regions of the\nparameter space of the compound nucleus.\n  Fusion reactions play an important role in this strategy because they\nminimise the uncertainty on the entrance channel by fixing mass, charge and\nexcitation energy of the compound nucleus. If incomplete fusion is negligible,\nthe only uncertainty on the compound nucleus comes from the spin distribution.\nHowever, some de-excitation channels, such as fission, are quite sensitive to\nspin. Other entrance channels can then be used to discriminate between\nequivalent parameter sets.\n  The focus of this work is on fission and intermediate-mass-fragment emission\ncross sections of compound nuclei with 70<=A<=240. The statistical\nde-excitation model is GEMINI++. The choice of the observables is natural in\nthe framework of GEMINI++, which describes fragment emission using a\nfission-like formalism. Equivalent parameter sets for fusion reactions can be\nresolved using the spallation entrance channel. This promising strategy can\nlead to the identification of a minimal set of physical ingredients necessary\nfor a unified quantitative description of nuclear de-excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 15:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

It was shown many years ago by EPR that two\nsystems which interacted in the past and separated afterwards had to be\ndescribed in most cases by particular non-separable states which are called\nentangled. It was noticed by Zanardi et al. that a Hilbert space of possible\nstate vectors of compound physical system could be partitioned in different way\nby introducing various tensor product structures induced by the experimentally\naccessible observables (interactions and measurements). Therefore a separable\nstate in one partition could become entangled in different partition. In this\nsense the entanglement was relative to a particular set of experimental\ncapabilities. Continuing this line of thought Torre et al. claimed to prove\nthat for any separable state there existed strongly correlated physical\nobservables therefore all quantum states were entangled. The same claims one\nmay find in several recent papers. In this paper we will discuss in operational\nway the differences existing between separable, non-separable and entangled\nstates and we will show that the conclusions of Torre et al. were unjustified.\nA sufficient condition for entanglement is the violation of BI-CHSH and/or\nsteering inequalities. Since there exist experiments outside the quantum\nphysics violating these inequalities therefore in the operational approach one\ncannot say that the entanglement is an exclusive quantum phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Aug 2012 15:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 16:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-10-26"}

It is proportional to\nthe dimensionless parameter $\\beta^2 = 2GM/rc^2$, which normally is $<< 1$.\nHere $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ the mass of the gravitating body,\n$r$ the position of the metric from the gravitating body and $c$ the speed of\nlight. The seeable universe is the sphere, with center at the observer, having\na size such that it shall contain all light emitted within it. For this to\noccur one can impose that the gravitational effect on the velocity of light at\n$r$ is zero for the radial component, and non zero for the tangential one.\nLight is then trapped. The condition is given by the equality $R_g = 2GM/c^2$,\nwhere $R_g$ represents the radius of the {\\it seeable} universe. It is the\ngravitational radius of the mass $M$. The result has been presented elsewhere\nas the condition for the universe to be treated as a black hole. According to\npresent observations, for the case of our universe taken as flat ($k = 0$), and\nthe equation of state as $p = - \\rho c^2$, we prove here from the Einstein's\ncosmological equations that the universe is expanding in an accelerated way as\n$t^2$, a constant acceleration as has been observed. This implies that the\ngravitational radius of the universe (at the event horizon) expands as $t^2$.\nTaking $c$ as constant, observing the galaxies deep in space this means deep in\ntime as $ct$, linear. Then, far away galaxies from the observer that we see\ntoday will disappear in time as they get out of the distance ct that is $<\nR_g$. The accelerated expanding vacuum will drag them out of sight. This may be\na valid test for the present ideas in cosmology. Previous calculations are here\nhalved by our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 22:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2013 22:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-22"}

Providing Internet banking is increasingly\nbecoming a \"need to have\" than a \"nice to have\" service. The net banking, thus,\nnow is more of a norm rather than an exception in many developed countries due\nto the fact that it is the cheapest way of providing banking services. This\nresearch paper will introduce you to e-banking, giving the meaning, functions,\ntypes, advantages and limitations of e-banking.

The structure and properties of HA,\nwhich is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected,\nchange significantly when the virus is transmitted from avian or swine species\nto humans. Here we focus on much smaller human individual evolutionary amino\nacid mutational changes in NA, which cleaves sialic acid groups and is required\nfor influenza virus replication. We show that very small amino acid changes can\nbe monitored very accurately across many Uniprot and NCBI strains using\nhydropathicity scales to quantify the roughness of water film packages.\nQuantitative sequential analysis is most effective with the differential\nhydropathicity scale based on protein self-organized criticality (SOC). NA\nexhibits punctuated evolution at the molecular scale, millions of times smaller\nthan the more familiar species scale, and thousands of times smaller than the\ngenomic scale. Our analysis shows that large-scale vaccination programs have\nbeen responsible for a very large convergent reduction in influenza severity in\nthe last century, a reduction which is hidden from short-term studies of\nvaccine effectiveness. Hydropathic analysis is capable of interpreting and even\npredicting trends of functional changes in mutation prolific viruses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2012 21:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2012 19:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-14"}
