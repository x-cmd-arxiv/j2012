Using a very large set of deep adaptive-mesh-refinement\nsimulations, we quantify the dependence of the SFR per free-fall time,\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$, on the above parameters. Our main results are: i)\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ decreases exponentially with increasing $t_{\\rm ff}/t_{\\rm\ndyn}$, but is insensitive to changes in ${\\cal M}_{\\rm s}$, for constant values\nof $t_{\\rm ff}/t_{\\rm dyn}$ and ${\\cal M}_{\\rm a}$. ii) Decreasing values of\n${\\cal M}_{\\rm a}$ (stronger magnetic fields) reduce $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$, but\nonly to a point, beyond which $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ increases with a further\ndecrease of ${\\cal M}_{\\rm a}$. iii) For values of ${\\cal M}_{\\rm a}$\ncharacteristic of star-forming regions, $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ varies with ${\\cal\nM}_{\\rm a}$ by less than a factor of two.

Because it only\ndepends on the mean gas density and rms velocity, this law is straightforward\nto implement in simulations and analytical models of galaxy formation and\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2012 16:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 18:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

As opposed to biologically inspired models, some\ntechniques as Granger causality (GC) are purely data-driven and rely on\nstatistical prediction and temporal precedence. While powerful and widely\napplicable, this approach could suffer from two main limitations when applied\nto BOLD fMRI data: confounding effect of hemodynamic response function (HRF)\nand conditioning to a large number of variables in presence of short time\nseries. For task-related fMRI, neural population dynamics can be captured by\nmodeling signal dynamics with explicit exogenous inputs; for resting-state fMRI\non the other hand, the absence of explicit inputs makes this task more\ndifficult, unless relying on some specific prior physiological hypothesis. In\norder to overcome these issues and to allow a more general approach, here we\npresent a simple and novel blind-deconvolution technique for BOLD-fMRI signal.\nComing to the second limitation, a fully multivariate conditioning with short\nand noisy data leads to computational problems due to overfitting. Furthermore,\nconceptual issues arise in presence of redundancy. We thus apply partial\nconditioning to a limited subset of variables in the framework of information\ntheory, as recently proposed. Mixing these two improvements we compare the\ndifferences between BOLD and deconvolved BOLD level effective networks and draw\nsome conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2012 17:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

Most protein domain ranking methods rely on the pairwise comparison of\nprotein domains while neglecting the global manifold structure of the protein\ndomain database. Recently, graph regularized ranking that exploits the global\nstructure of the graph defined by the pairwise similarities has been proposed.\nHowever, the existing graph regularized ranking methods are very sensitive to\nthe choice of the graph model and parameters, and this remains a difficult\nproblem for most of the protein domain ranking methods.\n  Results To tackle this problem, we have developed the Multiple Graph\nregularized Ranking algorithm, MultiG- Rank. Instead of using a single graph to\nregularize the ranking scores, MultiG-Rank approximates the intrinsic manifold\nof protein domain distribution by combining multiple initial graphs for the\nregularization. Graph weights are learned with ranking scores jointly and\nautomatically, by alternately minimizing an ob- jective function in an\niterative algorithm. Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOP\nprotein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better ranking\nperformance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwise\nsimilarity based ranking methods.\n  Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graph\nregularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combining\nmultiple graphs. This aspect of generalization introduces a new frontier in\napplying multiple graphs to solving protein domain ranking applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2012 19:32:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2013 14:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2013 06:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-23"}

The pseudo equivalent width (pEW) and Doppler\nshift of absorption-line-like features, such as Si II 6150A, Ca II HK 3750A,\nand the Ca II IR-triplet 8150A quantities that are often associated with the\noptical depth and the velocity of a shell of interacting material, are\nimportant tools for interpreting and classifying the SN Ia spectra. In this\npaper, we examine the nature of spectral features in SN Ia spectra using W7\nmodel spectra and a technique that we call \"knock-out\" spectra. We show that\nthe P-Cyg profiles of Si II 6150A and many other features are largely emission\ndominated, rather than absorption dominated, and that the concepts of\n\"absorption line\" and \"continuum\" are therefore not adequate to describe the\nnature of spectral features in SNe Ia. Apparent absorption features, like Si II\n6150A, are frequently just coincidental troughs between two (or more)\nuncorrelated emission features. In this situation, the pEW measured between\nthese emission peaks is little related to the true strength of the presumed\nabsorption feature. Furthermore, using the same knock-out technique, we\ndemonstrate how spectral features overlap each other at different times after\nthe explosion. This overlap distorts individual line profiles and affects\nmeasured absorption-line velocities. With synthetic SN Ia ejecta\nstratifications that are tuned to match specific observations, the method\npresented in this paper can in principle be used to quantify the effects of\nspecific line opacities on measured line velocity, line strength, and line\nblending, and improve the interpretation and informative value of observed SN\nIa spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2012 19:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 07:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

Such orbits lead to time-variable\nstellar heating, which has implications for the planet's atmospheric dynamical\nregime. However, little is known about this dynamical regime, and how it may\ninfluence observations. Therefore, we present a systematic study of hot\nJupiters on highly eccentric orbits using the SPARC/MITgcm, a model which\ncouples a three-dimensional general circulation model with a plane-parallel,\ntwo-stream, non-grey radiative transfer model. In our study, we vary the\neccentricity and orbit-average stellar flux over a wide range. We demonstrate\nthat the eccentric hot Jupiter regime is qualitatively similar to that of\nplanets on circular orbits; the planets possess a superrotating equatorial jet\nand exhibit large day-night temperature variations. We show that these\nday-night heating variations induce momentum fluxes equatorward to maintain the\nsuperrotating jet throughout its orbit. As the eccentricity and/or stellar flux\nis increased, the superrotating jet strengthens and narrows, due to a smaller\nRossby deformation radius. For a select number of model integrations, we\ngenerate full-orbit lightcurves and find that the timing of transit and\nsecondary eclipse viewed from Earth with respect to periapse and apoapse can\ngreatly affect what we see in infrared (IR) lightcurves; the peak in IR flux\ncan lead or lag secondary eclipse depending on the geometry.

In the ever evolving world of dynamic and on-line data, there\nis also a need for developing solutions to index texts which arrive on-line,\ni.e. a character at a time, and still be able to quickly locate said patterns.\nIn this paper, a new solution for on-line indexing is presented by providing an\non-line suffix tree construction in $O(\\log \\log n + \\log\\log |\\Sigma|)$\nworst-case expected time per character, where $n$ is the size of the string,\nand $\\Sigma$ is the alphabet. This improves upon all previously known on-line\nsuffix tree constructions for general alphabets, at the cost of having the run\ntime in expectation.\n  The main idea is to reduce the problem of constructing a suffix tree on-line\nto an interesting variant of the order maintenance problem, which may be of\nindependent interest. In the famous order maintenance problem, one wishes to\nmaintain a dynamic list $L$ of size $n$ under insertions, deletions, and order\nqueries. In an order query, one is given two nodes from $L$ and must determine\nwhich node precedes the other in $L$. In the Predecessor search on Dynamic\nSubsets of an Ordered Dynamic List problem (POLP) it is also necessary to\nmaintain dynamic subsets of $L$ such that given some $u\\in L$ it will be\npossible to quickly locate the predecessor of $u$ in any subset. This paper\nprovides an efficient data structure capable of solving the POLP with\nworst-case expected bounds that match the currently best known bounds for\npredecessor search in the RAM model, improving over a solution which may be\nimplicitly obtained from Dietz [Die89].\n  Furthermore, this paper improves or simplifies bounds for several additional\napplications, including fully-persistent arrays and the Order-Maintenance\nProblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2012 01:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

We provide analyses of\neach of these and show that, in many cases, zero state delivery alone presents\na tractable approximation of the expected packet delivery behaviour.\nInterestingly, while coefficient-based delivery has so far been treated as a\nsecondary effect in the literature, we find that the choice of coefficients is\nextremely important in determining the delay, and a well chosen encoding scheme\ncan, in fact, contribute a significant improvement to the delivery delay.\n  Based on our delivery delay model, we develop a dynamic rate adaptation\nscheme which uses performance prediction models to determine the sender\ntransmission rate.

In this paper, we investigate\nusing the bag-of-features strategy to classify the tissue types in medical\nimaging applications. Two important issues are considered here: the visual\nvocabulary learning and weighting. Although there are already plenty of\nalgorithms to deal with them, all of them treat them independently, namely, the\nvocabulary learned first and then the histogram weighted. Inspired by\nAuto-Context who learns the features and classifier jointly, we try to develop\na novel algorithm that learns the vocabulary and weights jointly. The new\nalgorithm, called Joint-ViVo, works in an iterative way. In each iteration, we\nfirst learn the weights for each visual word by maximizing the margin of ROI\ntriplets, and then select the most discriminate visual words based on the\nlearned weights for the next iteration. We test our algorithm on three tissue\nclassification tasks: identifying brain tissue type in magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), classifying lung tissue in HRCT images, and classifying breast\ntissue density in mammograms.

The goal is to minimize the total cost of this\nresource allocation scenario.\n  FTRA generalizes the Unconstrained Fault-Tolerant Resource Allocation\n(FTRA_{\\infty}) [18] and the classical Fault-Tolerant Facility Location (FTFL)\n[13] problems: for every site i, FTRA_{\\infty} does not have the constraint\nR_i, whereas FTFL sets R_i=1. These problems are said to be uniform if all\nr_j's are the same, and general otherwise.\n  For the general metric FTRA, we first give an LP-rounding algorithm achieving\nthe approximation ratio of 4. Then we show the problem reduces to FTFL,\nimplying the ratio of 1.7245 from [3]. For the uniform FTRA, we provide a\n1.52-approximation primal-dual algorithm in O(n^4) time, where n is the total\nnumber of sites and clients. We also consider the Constrained Fault-Tolerant\nk-Resource Allocation (k-FTRA) problem where additionally the total number of\nfacilities can be opened across all sites is bounded by k. For the uniform\nk-FTRA, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm with a factor\nof 4. Note that the above results carry over to FTRA_{\\infty} and\nk-FTRA_{\\infty}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2012 13:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Oct 2012 10:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2013 05:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 May 2013 09:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Because of the relevance of magnetism to pairing, the question of\nwhether long range spin magnetic order can coexist with superconductivity\nmicroscopically has attracted strong interests. The available experimental\nmethods used to answer this question are either bulk probes or local ones\nwithout control of probing position, thus the answers range from mutual\nexclusion to homogeneous coexistence. To definitively answer this question,\nhere we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the local electronic\nstructure of an underdoped NaFe1-xCoxAs near the spin density wave (SDW) and\nsuperconducting (SC) phase boundary. Spatially resolved spectroscopy directly\nreveal both the SDW and SC gap features at the same atomic location, providing\ncompelling evidence for the microscopic coexistence of the two phases. The\nstrengths of the SDW and SC features are shown to anti correlate with each\nother, indicating the competition of the two orders. The microscopic\ncoexistence clearly indicates that Cooper pairing occurs when portions of the\nFermi surface (FS) are already gapped by the SDW order. The regime TC < T <\nTSDW thus show a strong resemblance to the pseudogap phase of the cuprates\nwhere growing experimental evidences suggest a FS reconstruction due to certain\ndensity wave order. In this phase of the pnictides, the residual FS has a\nfavorable topology for magnetically mediated pairing when the ordering moment\nof the SDW is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Aug 2012 15:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
