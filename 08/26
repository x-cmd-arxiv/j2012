In this work we study two similar VCS models\nwith conserved noise, which differ from each other by the axial symmetry of\ntheir dynamic hopping rules. We use a coarse-grained approach to analyze the\nmodels and show how to determine the coefficients of their corresponding\ncontinuous stochastic differential equation (SDE) within the same universality\nclass. The employed method makes use of small translations in a test space\nwhich contains the stationary probability density function (SPDF). In case of\nthe symmetric model we calculate all the coarse-grained coefficients of the\nrelated conserved Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. With respect to the\nsymmetric model, the asymmetric model adds new terms which have to be analyzed,\nfirst of all the diffusion term, whose coarse-grained coefficient can be\ndetermined by the same method. In contrast to other methods, the used formalism\nallows to calculate all coefficients of the SDE theoretically and within limits\nnumerically. Above all, the used approach connects the coefficients of the SDE\nwith the SPDF and hence gives them a precise physical meaning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2012 16:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2013 01:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-30"}

This\npattern resembles the curvature induced on the field-lines by a neighboring\ncharge. Not only does the latter case involve a similar curvature, it moreover\nresults in attraction/repulsion. This suggests a hitherto unnoticed causal\nsymmetry: charge acceleration-field curvature. We prove quantitatively that\nthese two phenomena are essentially one and the same. The field stores some of\nthe charge's mass, yet it is extended in space, hence when the charge\naccelerates, inertia makes the field lag behind. The resulting stress in the\nfield stores some of the charge's kinetic energy in the form of potential\nenergy. The electrostatic interaction is the approximate mirror image of this\nprocess: The potential energy stored within the field turns into the charge's\nkinetic energy. This partial symmetry offers novel insights into two debated\nissues in electromagnetism. The question whether a charge radiates in a\ngravitational field receives a new twist: If all the charge's field-lines end\nwith opposite charges that also resist gravity, no radiation is expected.\nSimilarly for the famous absence of a physical manifestation of the Maxwell\nequations' advanced solution: Just as Einstein argued, the reason for this\nabsence is probabilistic rather than reflecting some inherent time-asymmetry.\nDespite the apparent equivalence between the \"ontological\" and\n\"instrumentalist\" viewpoints concerning the physical reality of field-lines,\nthere may be cases in which their experimental predictions differ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2012 19:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

Ideally, difference systems of sets should sacrifice as\nfew bits as possible for a given code length, alphabet size, and\nerror-tolerance capability.

In fact,\nthe majority of known optimal difference systems of sets are for exceptionally\nnoisy channels, requiring a substantial amount of bits for synchronization. To\naddress this problem, we present constructions for difference systems of sets\nthat allow for higher information rates while sacrificing optimality to only a\nsmall extent.

Stellar masses are calculated based on optical data\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and atomic gas masses are calculated\nusing atomic hydrogen (HI) emission line data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA\n(ALFALFA) survey. By using the technique of abundance matching, we combine the\nmeasured baryonic function (BMF) of galaxies with the dark matter halo mass\nfunction in a LCDM universe, in order to determine the galactic baryon fraction\nas a function of host halo mass. We find that the baryon fraction of low-mass\nhalos is much smaller than the cosmic value, even when atomic gas is taken into\naccount. We find that the galactic baryon deficit increases monotonically with\ndecreasing halo mass, in contrast with previous studies which suggested an\napproximately constant baryon fraction at the low-mass end. We argue that the\nobserved baryon fractions of low mass halos cannot be explained by reionization\nheating alone, and that additional feedback mechanisms (e.g. supernova blowout)\nmust be invoked. However, the outflow rates needed to reproduce our result are\nnot easily accommodated in the standard picture of galaxy formation in a LCDM\nuniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 15:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 21:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We begin with the\nmetrics of general relativity and show how they can be used to construct by\ninspection constants of motion, which can then be used to write down the\nequations of the trajectories. This will be achieved by deriving a\nHamiltonian-Jacobi function from the metric and showing that its existence\nrequires all of the above mentioned properties.
