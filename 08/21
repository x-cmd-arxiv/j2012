This galaxy\ncontains an almost perpendicular warped ring and one possible companion galaxy\nto the NW. The radial velocity of this object is 3301\\pm65 km/s and is part of\na group of fifteen possible polar ring galaxies, according to the literature.\nIn order to better understand this system, images and long slit spectra were\nobserved with the 1.60 m OPD/LNA telescope.

This model grid is then compared to a sample of\nhigh-redshift SNe Ia in order to test whether the observed diversities can be\nexplained by luminosity and metallicity changes alone. The dispersion in\nbroadband UV flux and colours at approximately constant optical spectrum can be\nreadily matched by the model grid.

The models are less successful\nin reproducing other observed trends, such as the wavelengths of key UV\nfeatures, which are dominated by reverse fluorescence photons from the optical,\nor intermediate band photometric indices. This can be explained in terms of the\ngreater sensitivity of these detailed observables to modest changes in the\nrelative abundances.

In a\nprevious paper, we have found that indeed the conventional wisdom of binary\nformation, based on three-body encounters, is incorrect. Here we refine that\ninsight, by further dissecting the subsequent steps leading to hard binary\nformation. For this purpose, we add some analysis tools in order to make the\nstudy less subjective.

We conclude that, while three-body\nencounters can be analytically approximated as isolated, subsequent strong\nperturbations typically occur whenever those encounters give rise to democratic\nresonances.

The ISM is\nturbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating, and is subject to heating and cooling\nprocesses that control its thermodynamic behavior. The turbulence in the warm\nand hot ionized components of the ISM appears to be trans- or subsonic, and\nthus to behave nearly incompressibly. However, the neutral warm and cold\ncomponents are highly compressible, as a consequence of both thermal\ninstability in the atomic gas and of moderately-to-strongly supersonic motions\nin the roughly isothermal cold atomic and molecular components. Within this\ncontext, we discuss: i) the production and statistical distribution of\nturbulent density fluctuations in both isothermal and polytropic media; ii) the\nnature of the clumps produced by thermal instability, noting that, contrary to\nclassical ideas, they in general accrete mass from their environment; iii) the\ndensity-magnetic field correlation (or lack thereof) in turbulent density\nfluctuations, as a consequence of the superposition of the different wave modes\nin the turbulent flow; iv) the evolution of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio\n(MFR) in density fluctuations as they are built up by dynamic compressions; v)\nthe formation of cold, dense clouds aided by thermal instability; vi) the\nexpectation that star-forming molecular clouds are likely to be undergoing\nglobal gravitational contraction, rather than being near equilibrium, and vii)\nthe regulation of the star formation rate (SFR) in such gravitationally\ncontracting clouds by stellar feedback which, rather than keeping the clouds\nfrom collapsing, evaporates and diperses them while they collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 22:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 00:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

Also, we introduce a flexible two parameter weighting\nmechanism, the first parameter describes the compatibility between the datasets\nunder study and the semi-supervised clustering algorithms used to generate the\nbase partitions, the second parameter is used to provide the user feedback on\nthe these partitions. The two parameters are engaged in a \"relabeling and\nvoting\" based consensus function to produce the final clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2012 23:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-22"}

Considering the relatively small rhombohedral strain in BaTiO3, the\ncompetition between the energies of Bloch and Ising FDWs can be discussed in\nterms of a picture in which a Bloch wall is regarded as being composed of a\npair of smaller-angle Ising ones. A reduction by 40% in the parameters\ndescribing the gradient term in the GLD model brings it into better agreement\nwith the first-principles results for detailed properties such as the energies\nand widths of the FDWs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 00:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-12-11"}

For the samples obtained by natural cooling down to\nroom temperature in the furnace, referred to as furnace cooling,\nsuperconducting phase aggregates into micrometer-sized rectangular bars and\naligns as disconnected chains. Accompanying this change in morphology the\nsuperconducting shielding fraction is strongly reduced in the furnace-cooling\nsamples.

A reversible change from network to bar chains was realized by a secondary\nheat treatment in annealed samples showing large shielding fraction, i.e.,\nheating above Ts followed by slow cooling across Ts. The large shielding\nfraction observed in KxFe1.6+ySe2 single crystals actually results from a\nuniform and contiguous distribution of superconducting phase.

It is designed to enable efficient searches for obscured, previously\nunknown, PN candidates present in the photometric source catalogues of Galactic\nplane MIR sky surveys. Such selection is now possible via new, sensitive,\nhigh-to-medium resolution, MIR satellite surveys such as those from the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope and the all-sky Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)\nsatellite missions. MIR selection is based on how different colour-colour\nplanes isolate zones (sometimes overlapping) that are predominately occupied by\ndifferent astrophysical object types. These techniques depend on the\nreliability of the available MIR source photometry. In this pilot study we\nconcentrate on MIR point source detections and show that it is dangerous to\ntake the MIR GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire)\nphotometry from Spitzer for each candidate at face value without examining the\nactual MIR image data. About half of our selected sources are spurious\ndetections due to the applied source detection algorithms being affected by\ncomplex MIR backgrounds and the de-blending of diffraction spikes around bright\nMIR point sources into point sources themselves. Nevertheless, once this\nadditional visual diagnostic checking is performed, valuable MIR selected PN\ncandidates are uncovered. Four turned out to have faint, compact, optical\ncounterparts in our H-alpha survey data missed in previous optical searches. We\nconfirm all of these as true PNe via our follow-up optical spectroscopy. This\nlends weight to the veracity of our MIR technique. It demonstrates sufficient\nrobustness that high-confidence samples of new Galactic PN candidates can be\nextracted from these MIR surveys without confirmatory optical spectroscopy and\nimaging.

Currently, developers do runtime\nadaptation by using external scripts and/or by inserting operators into the\nstream processing graph that are unrelated to the data processing logic. In\nthis paper, we describe a component called orchestrator that allows users to\nwrite routines for automatically adapting the application to runtime\nconditions. Developers build an orchestrator by registering and handling events\nas well as specifying actuations. Events can be generated due to changes in the\nsystem state (e.g., application component failures), built-in system metrics\n(e.g., throughput of a connection), or custom application metrics (e.g.,\nquality score). Once the orchestrator receives an event, users can take\nadaptation actions by using the orchestrator actuation APIs. We demonstrate the\nuse of the orchestrator in IBM's System S in the context of three different\napplications, illustrating application adaptation to changes on the incoming\ndata distribution, to application failures, and on-demand dynamic composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 02:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-22"}

The radiation belts rebuild in a dynamical\nway with the energy spectra flattening on the average during the course of many\nmillennia, but without ever reaching complete steady state equilibrium between\nsuccessive geomagnetic storm events determined by southward turnings of the IMF\norientation. Considering that the entry of galactic cosmic rays and the solar\nenergetic particles with energies above a given threshold are strongly\ncontrolled by the intensity of the northward component of the interplanetary\nmagnetic field, we speculate that at earlier epochs when the geomagnetic dipole\nwas reversed, the entry of these energetic particles into the geomagnetic field\nwas facilitated when the interplanetary magnetic field was directed northward.\nUnlike in other complementary work where intensive numerical simulations have\nbeen used, our demonstration is based on a simple analytical extension of\nStormer's theory. The access of GCR and SEP beyond geomagnetic cut-off\nlatitudes is enhanced during epochs when the Earth's magnetic dipole is\nreduced, as already demonstrated earlier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 08:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-22"}

To do this we model\nhydrostatic atmospheres in a strong radial magnetic field, determining both\ntheir maximum extent and photospheric temperatures. We find that\nspatially-extended atmospheres cannot exist in such a field configuration:\ntypical maximum extent for magnetar-strength fields is ~10 m (as compared to\n200 km in the non-magnetic case). Achieving balance of gravitational and\nradiative forces over a large range of radii, which is critical to the\nexistence of extended atmospheres, is rendered impossible in strong fields due\nto the dependence of opacities on temperature and field strength. We conclude\nthat high luminosity bursts in magnetars do not lead to expansion and cooling\nof the photosphere, as in the non-magnetic case. We also find the maximum\nluminosity that can propagate through a hydrostatic magnetar atmosphere to be\nlower than previous estimates.

Self-sustained turbulent motion in microbial suspensions\npresents an intriguing example of collective dynamical behavior amongst the\nsimplest forms of life, and is important for fluid mixing and molecular\ntransport on the microscale. The mathematical characterization of turbulence\nphenomena in active non-equilibrium fluids proves even more difficult than for\nconventional liquids or gases. It is not known which features of turbulent\nphases in living matter are universal or system-specific, or which\ngeneralizations of the Navier-Stokes equations are able to describe them\nadequately. Here, we combine experiments, particle simulations, and continuum\ntheory to identify the statistical properties of self-sustained meso-scale\nturbulence in active systems. To study how dimensionality and boundary\nconditions affect collective bacterial dynamics, we measured energy spectra and\nstructure functions in dense Bacillus subtilis suspensions in quasi-2D and 3D\ngeometries. Our experimental results for the bacterial flow statistics agree\nwell with predictions from a minimal model for self-propelled rods, suggesting\nthat at high concentrations the collective motion of the bacteria is dominated\nby short-range interactions. To provide a basis for future theoretical studies,\nwe propose a minimal continuum model for incompressible bacterial flow.

The line-profile variability is dominated by a radial mode\n(f_1=7.14846 d^{-1}) and by rotational modulation (P_rot=3.638833 d). Two\nnon-radial low-amplitude modes (f_2=7.75603 d^{-1} and f_3=6.82308 d^{-1}) are\nalso detected. The four periodicities that we found are the same as the ones\ndiscovered from a companion multisite photometric campaign (Handler et al.\n2012) and known in the literature. Using the photometric constraints on the\ndegrees l of the pulsation modes, we show that both f_2 and f_3 are prograde\nmodes with (l,m)=(4,2) or (4,3). These results allowed us to deduce ranges for\nthe mass (M \\in [8.2,9.6] M_o) and central hydrogen abundance (X_c \\in\n[0.25,0.32]) of V2052 Oph, to identify the radial orders n_1=1, n_2=-3 and\nn_3=-2, and to derive an equatorial rotation velocity v_eq \\in [71,75] km\ns^{-1}. The model parameters are in full agreement with the effective\ntemperature and surface gravity deduced from spectroscopy. Only models with no\nor mild core overshooting (alpha_ov \\in [0,0.15] local pressure scale heights)\ncan account for the observed properties. Such a low overshooting is opposite to\nour previous modelling results for the non-magnetic beta Cep star theta Oph\nhaving very similar parameters, except for a slower surface rotation rate. We\ndiscuss whether this result can be explained by the presence of a magnetic\nfield in V2052 Oph that inhibits mixing in its interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 12:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Stars are known to form from the gravitational collapse of dense\nclumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it has been proposed that the\nresulting star formation rate is proportional to either the amount of mass\nabove a threshold gas surface density, or the gas volume density. These\nstar-formation prescriptions appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in our\nMilky Way Galaxy's disk as well as in distant galaxies where the star formation\nrates are often much larger. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, the Central\nMolecular Zone (CMZ), contains the largest concentration of dense, high-surface\ndensity molecular gas in the Milky Way, providing an environment where the\nvalidity of star-formation prescriptions can be tested. Here we show that by\nseveral measures, the current star formation rate in the CMZ is an\norder-of-magnitude lower than the rates predicted by the currently accepted\nprescriptions. In particular, the region 1 deg < l < 3.5 deg, |b| < 0.5 deg\ncontains ~10^7 Msun of dense molecular gas -- enough to form 1000 Orion-like\nclusters -- but the present-day star formation rate within this gas is only\nequivalent to that in Orion. In addition to density, another property of\nmolecular clouds, such as the amplitude of turbulent motions, must be included\nin the star-formation prescription to predict the star formation rate in a\ngiven mass of molecular gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 12:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In this paper, we propose\na new approach of building a massively-parallel search engine using a DB-IR\ntightly-integrated parallel DBMS and demonstrate its commercial-level\nscalability and performance. In addition, we present a hybrid (i.e., analytic\nand experimental) performance model for the parallel search engine. We have\nbuilt a five-node parallel search engine according to the proposed architecture\nusing a DB-IR tightly-integrated DBMS.

It has been shown that most of the energy is\nreleased deep in the crust by pycnonuclear reactions involving low-Z elements.\nWe discuss if NSs in very-faint X-ray transients (VFXTs; those which have peak\nX-ray luminosities < 1E36 erg/s) can be used to test this model. Unfortunately\nwe cannot conclusively answer this because of the large uncertainties in our\nestimates of the accretion rate history of those VFXTs, both the short-term\n(less than a few tens of thousands of years) and the one throughout their\nlifetime. The latter is important because it can be so low that the NSs might\nnot have accreted enough matter to become massive enough that enhanced cooling\nprocesses become active. Therefore, they could be relatively warm compared to\nother systems for which such enhanced cooling processed have been inferred.\nHowever, the amount of matter can also not be too low because then the crust\nmight not have been replaced significantly by accreted matter and thus a hybrid\ncrust of partly accreted and partly original, albeit further compressed matter,\nmight be present. This would inhibit the full range of pycnonuclear reactions\nto occur and thus very likely decreasing the amount of heat deposited in the\ncrust. Furthermore, better understanding is needed how a hybrid crust affects\nother properties such as the thermal conductivity. We also show that some\nindividual NS LMXBs might have hybrid crusts as well as the NSs in HMXBs.

In this respect, many works have\nconcentrated on the disambiguation of the cosmological signals from the\ndominant reionization foregrounds. However, even after perfect foregrounds\nremoval, our ignorance on the background reionization history can significantly\naffect the cosmological parameter estimation. In particular, the\ninterdependence between the hydrogen ionized fraction, the baryon density and\nthe optical depth to the redshift of observation induce nontrivial degeneracies\nbetween the cosmological parameters that have not been considered so far. Using\na simple, but consistent reionization model, we revisit their expected\nconstraints for a futuristic giant 21-cm omniscope by using for the first time\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on multiredshift full sky simulated\ndata. Our results agree well with the usual Fisher matrix analysis on the\nthree-dimensional flat sky power spectrum but only when the above-mentioned\ndegeneracies are kept under control. In the opposite situation, Fisher results\ncan be inaccurate. We show that these conditions can be fulfilled by combining\ncosmic microwave background measurements with multiple observation redshifts\nprobing the beginning of EoR. This allows a precise reconstruction of the total\noptical depth, reionization duration and maximal spin temperature. Finally, we\ndiscuss the robustness of these results in presence of unresolved ionizing\nsources.

By comparing the derived EMDs with\nthe \"true\" distributions from the model we assess the limitations of the\ndiagnostics, as a function of the plasma parameters and of the signal-to-noise\nof the data.\n  We find that EMDs derived from EIS synthetic data reproduce some general\ncharacteristics of the true distributions, but usually show differences from\nthe true EMDs that are much larger than the estimated uncertainties suggest,\nespecially when structures with significantly different density overlap along\nthe line-of-sight. When using AIA synthetic data the derived EMDs reproduce the\ntrue EMDs much less accurately, especially for broad EMDs. The differences\nbetween the two instruments are due to the: (1) smaller number of constraints\nprovided by AIA data, (2) broad temperature response function of the AIA\nchannels which provide looser constraints to the temperature distribution.\n  Our results suggest that EMDs derived from current observatories may often\nshow significant discrepancies from the true EMDs, rendering their\ninterpretation fraught with uncertainty. These inherent limitations to the\nmethod should be carefully considered when using these distributions to\nconstrain coronal heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Aug 2012 14:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
