The measurements reveal considerable\npiezoelectric nonlinearity, i.e., dependence of d33 on the amplitude of the\ndynamic stress. The nonlinear response suggests a large irreversible\ncontribution of non-180{\\deg} domain walls to the piezoelectric response of the\nferrite, which, at present measurement conditions, reached a maximum of 38% of\nthe total measured d33. In agreement with this interpretation, both types of\nnon-180{\\deg} domain walls, characteristic for the rhombohedral BiFeO3, i.e.,\n71{\\deg} and 109{\\deg}, were identified in the poled ceramics using\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM). In support to the link between\nnonlinearity and non-180{\\deg} domain wall contribution, we found a correlation\nbetween nonlinearity and processes leading to deppining of domain walls from\ndefects, such as quenching from above the Curie temperature and\nhigh-temperature sintering. In addition, the nonlinear piezoelectric response\nof BiFeO3 showed a frequency dependence that is qualitatively different from\nthat measured in other nonlinear ferroelectric ceramics, such as \"soft\"\n(donor-doped) Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT); possible origins of this dispersion are\ndiscussed. Finally, we show that, once released from pinning centers, the\ndomain walls can contribute extensively to the electromechanical response of\nBiFeO3; in fact, the extrinsic domain-wall contribution is relatively as large\nas in Pb-based ferroelectric ceramics with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB)\ncomposition, such as PZT. This finding might be important in the search of new\nlead-free MPB compositions based on BiFeO3 as it suggests that such\ncompositions might also exhibit large extrinsic domain-wall contribution to the\npiezoelectric response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 16:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Methods: In a previous work, we ran full 3D,\ntwo-fluid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of a planet\nembedded in a gas+dust T Tauri disk for different planet masses and grain\nsizes. In this work, the resulting dust distributions are passed to the Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer code MCFOST to construct synthetic images in the ALMA\nwavebands. We then use the ALMA simulator to produce images that include\nthermal and phase noise for a range of angular resolutions, wavelengths, and\nintegration times, as well as for different inclinations, declinations and\ndistances. We also produce images which assume that gas and dust are well mixed\nwith a gas-to-dust ratio of 100 to compare with previous ALMA predictions, all\nmade under this hypothesis. Results: Our findings clearly demonstrate the\nimportance of correctly incorporating the dust dynamics. We show that the gap\ncarved by a 1 M_J planet orbiting at 40 AU is visible with a much higher\ncontrast than the well-mixed assumption would predict. In the case of a 5 M_J\nplanet, we clearly see a deficit in dust emission in the inner disk, and point\nout the risk of interpreting the resulting image as that of a transition disk\nwith an inner hole if observed in unfavorable conditions. Planet signatures are\nfainter in more distant disks but declination or inclination to the\nline-of-sight have little effect on ALMA's ability to resolve the gaps.\nConclusions: ALMA has the potential to see signposts of planets in disks of\nnearby star-forming regions.

That is, instead\nof answering narrow questions such as \"does privacy definition Y protect X?\"\nthe goal is to answer the more general question \"what does privacy definition Y\nprotect?\"\n  The privacy guarantees we can extract are Bayesian in nature and deal with\nchanges in an attacker's beliefs. The key to our framework is an object we call\nthe row cone. Every privacy definition has a row cone, which is a convex set\nthat describes all the ways an attacker's prior beliefs can be turned into\nposterior beliefs after observing an output of an algorithm satisfying that\nprivacy definition.\n  The framework can be applied to privacy definitions or even to individual\nalgorithms to identify the types of inferences they defend against. We\nillustrate the use of our framework with analyses of several definitions and\nalgorithms for which we can derive previously unknown semantics. These include\nrandomized response, FRAPP, and several algorithms that add integer-valued\nnoise to their inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 16:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-28"}

When the laser field is turned off, the Dirac\noperator has resonances in both the positive and the negative energy continua\nwhile bound states are in the mass gap. When this system is immersed in a\nstrong laser field, the resonances move in the complex energy plane: the\nnegative energy resonances are pushed to higher energies while the bound states\nare Stark shifted. It is argued here that there is a pair production\nenhancement at the crossing of resonances by looking at a simple 1-D model: the\nnuclei are modeled simply by Dirac delta potential wells while the laser field\nis assumed to be static and of finite spatial extent. The average rate for the\nnumber of electron-positron pairs produced is evaluated and the results are\ncompared to the single nucleus and to the free cases. It is shown that\npositrons are produced by the Resonantly Enhanced Pair Production (REPP)\nmechanism, which is analogous to the resonantly enhanced ionization of\nmolecular physics.

Our\ninitial model does not support this conclusion, due to the fact that the\nreflected shock is expanding into much lower densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 20:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

A radial\nvelocity measurement confirms that, at apastron, we are now seeing direct light\nfrom star B, which is more luminous and of earlier spectral class than star A.\nEvidently, the trailing edge of the occulting screen has just become tangent to\none anse of star B's projected orbit.

Thus complete answers, existence of the limit\nmetric, regularity of the minimizing eigenfunction and various qualitative\nproperties of the metric are easily obtained from the solution of the Composite\nMembrane problem. The problem of minimizing eigenvalues over conformal classes\nhas a higher dimensional analog for the critical GJMS operator and leads to new\nclasses and questions for higher order unstable free boundary problems. In\nparticular in dimension 4 we are lead to free boundary problems involving the\nPaneitz operator and in odd dimensions to fractional free boundary problems of\nunstable type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2012 21:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 16:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2012 12:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-11"}

The results hereafter shed new light on the connection\nbetween both the volatility of the continuous component and the jump parameters\nand the behavior of ATM option prices near expiration. In the presence of a\nBrownian component, the second-order term, in time-$t$, is of the form\n$d_{2}\\,t^{(3-Y)/2}$, with $d_{2}$ only depending on $Y$, the degree of jump\nactivity, on $\\sigma$, the volatility of the continuous component, and on an\nadditional parameter controlling the intensity of the \"small\" jumps (regardless\nof their signs).

The approach\nhas two advantages: (i) it provides a unified procedure to establish the\ndiffusion approximations regardless of the structure of the queueing model or\nthe type of patience-time scaling; (ii) and it makes the diffusion analysis of\nqueues with customer abandonment essentially the same as the diffusion analysis\nof queues without customer abandonment. We demonstrate the application of this\napproach via the single server system with Markov-modulated service speeds in\nthe traditional heavy-traffic regime and the many-server system in the\nHalfin-Whitt regime and the non-degenerate slowdown regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 04:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 17:23:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2015 06:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

Using the technique of wavelet transforms a\nrepresentation of the high dimensional phase space, the resonance network or\nArnold web, is constructed and analysed. The key structures in phase space\nwhich regulate the dissociation dynamics are identified. Furthermore, we show\nthat the web is nonuniform with the classical dynamics exhibiting extensive\nstickiness, resulting in anomalous transport. Our work also shows that pairwise\nirrational barriers might be crucial even in higher dimensional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 07:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-29"}

In the case of deterministic chaotic dynamics, we will consider\nobservables specially designed to study the recurrence properties in the\nneighbourhood of periodic points.

Here we present predictions\nfor two proposed extragalactic ASKAP neutral hydrogen (HI) emission-line\nsurveys, based on semi-analytic models applied to cosmological N-body\nsimulations. The ASKAP HI All-Sky Survey, known as WALLABY, is a shallow 3 Pi\nsurvey (z = 0 - 0.26) which will probe the mass and dynamics of over 600,000\ngalaxies. A much deeper small-area HI survey, called DINGO, aims to trace the\nevolution of HI from z = 0 - 0.43, a cosmological volume of 40 million Mpc^3,\ndetecting potentially 100,000 galaxies. The high-sensitivity 30 antenna ASKAP\ncore (diameter ~2 km) will provide an angular resolution of 30 arcsec (at z=0).\nOur simulations show that the majority of galaxies detected in WALLABY (87.5%)\nwill be resolved. About 5000 galaxies will be well resolved, i.e. more than\nfive beams (2.5 arcmin) across the major axis, enabling kinematic studies of\ntheir gaseous disks. This number would rise to 160,000 galaxies if all 36 ASKAP\nantennas could be used; the additional six antennas provide baselines up to 6\nkm, resulting in an angular resolution of 10 arcsec. For DINGO this increased\nresolution is highly desirable to minimise source confusion; reducing confusion\nrates from a maximum of 10% of sources at the survey edge to 3%. We estimate\nthat the sources detected by WALLABY and DINGO will span four orders of\nmagnitude in total halo mass (from 10^{11} to 10^{15} Msol) and nearly seven\norders of magnitude in stellar mass (from 10^{5} to 10^{12} Msol), allowing us\nto investigate the process of galaxy formation across the last four billion\nyears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 09:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2012 04:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Oct 2012 02:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For problems with only continuous predictors simple random\nsubsampling is a reliable method to generate initial coefficient estimates that\ncan then be further refined. For data with categorical predictors, however,\nrandom subsampling often does not work, thus limiting the use of an otherwise\nfine estimator. This also makes the choice of estimator for robust linear\nregression dependent on the type of predictors, which is an unnecessary\nnuisance in practice. For data with categorical predictors random subsampling\noften generates singular subsamples. Since these subsamples cannot be used to\ncalculate coefficient estimates, they have to be discarded. This makes random\nsubsampling slow, especially if some levels of categorical predictors have low\nfrequency, and renders the algorithms infeasible for such problems. This paper\nintroduces an improved subsampling algorithm that only generates nonsingular\nsubsamples. We call it nonsingular subsampling. For data with continuous\nvariables it is as fast as simple random subsampling but much faster for data\nwith categorical predictors. This is achieved by using a modified LU\ndecomposition algorithm that combines the generation of a sample and the\nsolving of the least squares problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 09:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-29"}

A typical resulting relaxation rate for a self-assembled Mn-doped ZnTe\nquantum dot populated by a hole is 1 $\\mu$s. We also show that decoherence\narising from nuclear spins in lateral quantum dots is still removable by a spin\necho protocol, even if the confined electron is spin-orbit coupled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 09:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-02"}

The\nquestion of how these paths are identified is related to the fundamental\nproblem of topology discovery. Distributed algorithms for topology discovery\ncope with a never ending task, dealing with frequent changes in the network\ntopology and unpredictable transient faults. Therefore, algorithms for topology\ndiscovery should be self-stabilizing to ensure convergence of the topology\ninformation following any such unpredictable sequence of events. We present the\nfirst such algorithm that can cope with Byzantine nodes. Starting in an\narbitrary global state, and in the presence of f Byzantine nodes, each node is\neventually aware of all the other non-Byzantine nodes and their connecting\ncommunication links. Using the topology information, nodes can, for example,\nroute messages across the network and deliver messages from one end user to\nanother. We present the first deterministic, cryptographicassumptions- free,\nself-stabilizing, Byzantine-resilient algorithms for network topology discovery\nand end-to-end message delivery. We also consider the task of r-neighborhood\ndiscovery for the case in which r and the degree of nodes are bounded by\nconstants. The use of r-neighborhood discovery facilitates polynomial time,\ncommunication and space solutions for the above tasks. The obtained algorithms\ncan be used to authenticate parties, in particular during the establishment of\nprivate secrets, thus forming public key schemes that are resistant to\nman-in-the-middle attacks of the compromised Byzantine nodes. A polynomial and\nefficient end-to-end algorithm that is based on the established private secrets\ncan be employed in between periodical re-establishments of the secrets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 11:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 08:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2013 07:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-01-31"}

The ions are\nbuffer-gas cooled and held in a linear quadrupole trap that is integrated into\na sealed, getter-pumped vacuum package, and interrogated on the 12.6 GHz\nhyperfine transition. We hope to achieve a long-term fractional frequency\nstability of 10^-14 with a miniature clock that consumes only 50 mW of power\nand occupies a volume of 5 cm^3. I discuss our progress over several years of\nwork on this project. We began by building a conventional tabletop clock to use\nas a test bed while developing several designs of miniature ion-trap vacuum\npackages, while also developing techniques for various aspects of the clock\noperation, including ion loading, laser and magnetic field stabilization, and a\nlow power ion trap drive. The ion traps were modeled using boundary element\nsoftware to assist with the design and parameter optimization of new trap\ngeometries. We expect a novel trap geometry that uses a material new to ion\ntraps to lead to an exceptionally small ion trap vacuum package in the next\nphase of the project. To achieve the long-term stability required, we have also\nconsidered the sensitivity of the clock frequency to magnetic fields. A study\nof the motion of the individual ions in a room-temperature cloud in the trap\nwas performed with the purpose of understanding the effect of both spatially\nvarying and constant magnetic fields on the clock resonance and therefore the\noperation of the clock. These effects were studied experimentally and\ntheoretically for several traps. In summary, this dissertation is a\ncontribution to the design, development, and testing of a 171Yb+ ion cloud\nfrequency standard and related techniques, including analyses of trap\ngeometries and parameters, modeling of the ion motion, and the practical\noperation of the clock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 11:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-29"}

To handle flows\nin porous media, the fundamental issue is to model correctly the convective\ntransport of individual phases. Moreover, for compressible media, the pressure\nequation itself is just a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation.\n  For different problems, a convection-diffusion equation may be be written in\nvarious forms. The most popular formulation of convective transport employs the\ndivergent (conservative) form. In some cases, the nondivergent (characteristic)\nform seems to be preferable. The so-called skew-symmetric form of convective\ntransport operators that is the half-sum of the operators in the divergent and\nnondivergent forms is of great interest in some applications.\n  Here we discuss the basic classes of discretization in space: finite\ndifference schemes on rectangular grids, approximations on general polyhedra\n(the finite volume method), and finite element procedures. The key properties\nof discrete operators are studied for convective and diffusive transport. We\nemphasize the problems of constructing approximations for convection and\ndiffusion operators that satisfy the maximum principle at the discrete level\n--- they are called monotone approximations.\n  Two- and three-level schemes are investigated for transient problems.\nUnconditionally stable explicit-implicit schemes are developed for\nconvection-diffusion problems.

Predictions for formation and\nequilibration of turbulent jets made using S3T are critically compared with\nresults of simulations made using the associated quasi-linear and nonlinear\nmodels. S3T predicts the observed bifurcation behavior associated with the\nemergence of jets, their equilibration and their breakdown as a function of\nparameters. Quantitative differences in bifurcation parameter values between\npredictions of S3T and results of nonlinear simulations are traced to\nmodification of the eddy spectrum which results from two processes: nonlinear\neddy-eddy interactions and formation of discrete non-zonal structures.\nRemarkably, these non-zonal structures, which substantially modify the\nturbulence spectrum, are found to arise from S3T instability.

Variations of the resonance frequency and\nthe quality factor are determined by the change in average charge on the\nquantum dot during a mechanical oscillation. The average charge, in turn, is\ninfluenced by the gate voltage, the bias voltage, and the tunnel rates of the\nbarriers to the leads. At bias voltages that exceed the broadening due to\ntunnel coupling, the resonance frequency and quality factor show a double dip\nas a function of gate voltage.

More than\nhalf the currently known VHE sources are to be found in the Galactic plane.\nUsing standard techniques, CTA can carry out a survey of the region |l|<60\ndegrees, |b|<2 degrees in 250 hr (1/4th the available time per year at one\nlocation) down to a uniform sensitivity of 3 mCrab (a \"Galactic Plane survey\").\nCTA could also survey 1/4th of the sky down to a sensitivity of 20 mCrab in 370\nhr of observing time (an \"all-sky survey\"), which complements well the surveys\nby the Fermi/LAT at lower energies and extended air shower arrays at higher\nenergies. Observations in (non-standard) divergent pointing mode may shorten\nthe \"all-sky survey\" time to about 100 hr with no loss in survey sensitivity.\nWe present the scientific rationale for these surveys, their place in the\nmulti-wavelength context, their possible impact and their feasibility. We find\nthat the Galactic Plane survey has the potential to detect hundreds of sources.\nImplementing such a survey should be a major goal of CTA. Additionally, about a\ndozen blazars, or counterparts to Fermi/LAT sources, are expected to be\ndetected by the all-sky survey, whose prime motivation is the search for\nextragalactic \"dark accelerators\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 15:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The model describes transport through clean C\nnanotubes %with weak disorder and in Si fin-type field effect transistors,\nunder an applied magnetic field.
