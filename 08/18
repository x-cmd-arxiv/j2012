For favourable values of deltacp, NOvA sensitivity\nto mass hierarchy and leptonic CP violation is increased by 20%. Addition of 5\nyears of neutrino data from T2K to NOvA more than doubles the range of deltacp\nfor which the leptonic CP violation can be discovered, compared to stand alone\nNOvA. But for unfavourable values of deltacp, the combination of NOvA and T2K\nare not enough to provide even a 90% C.L. hint of hierarchy discovery.\nTherefore, we further explore the improvement in the hierarchy and CP violation\nsensitivities due to the addition of a 10 kt liquid argon detector placed close\nto NOvA site.

It is not known whether the remaining\nwhite dwarfs are not magnetic, or if they have a magnetic field too weak to be\ndetected with the techniques adopted in the large surveys. Aims. We describe\nthe results of the first survey specifically devised to clarify the detection\nfrequency of kG-level magnetic fields in cool DA white dwarfs. Methods: Using\nthe FORS1 instrument of the ESO VLT, we have obtained Balmer line circular\nspectropolarimetric measurements of a small sample of cool (DA6 - DA8) white\ndwarfs. Using FORS and UVES archive data, we have also revised numerous white\ndwarf field measurements previously published in the literature. Results: We\nhave discovered an apparently constant longitudinal magnetic field of \\sim9.5\nkG in the DA6 white dwarf WD2105-820. This star is the first weak-field white\ndwarf that has been observed sufficiently to roughly determine the\ncharacteristics of its field. The available data are consistent with a simple\ndipolar morphology with magnetic axis nearly parallel to the rotation axis, and\na polar strength of \\simeq 56 kG. Our re-evaluation of the FORS archive data\nfor white dwarfs indicates that longitudinal magnetic fields weaker than 10 kG\nhad previously been correctly identified in at least three white dwarfs.\nConclusions: We find that the probability of detecting a field of kG strength\nin a DA white dwarf is of the order of 10% for each of the cool and hot DA\nstars. If there is a lower cutoff to field strength in white dwarfs, or a field\nbelow which all white dwarfs are magnetic, the current precision of\nmeasurements is not yet sufficient to reveal it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 18:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This\nmethod was developed for determination of phenomenological characteristics of\nthe light curves, which are necessary for registration in the \"General\nCatalogue of Variable Stars\" and other databases. For eclipsing binary stars\nwith smooth light curves - of types EB and EW - it is recommended a\ntrigonometric polynomial of optimal degree in a complete or symmetric form. For\neclipsing binary systems with narrow minima (EA-type), statistically optimal is\nan approximation in a class of non-polynomial spline functions. It is used a\ncombination of the second-order trigonometric polynomial (TP2, what describes\neffects of \"reflection\", \"ellipsoidality\" and \"spotness\") and localized\ncontributions of minima (parametrized in depth and profile separately for\nprimary and secondary minima). Such an approach is characterized by a\nstatistical accuracy of the smoothing curve, which is up to ~1.5-2 times better\nthan the trigonometric polynomial of statistically optimal degree, and the\nabsence of false \"waves\" in the light curve associated with the effect of\nGibbs. In addition to the minimum width, which can not be determined by a\ntrigonometric polynomial approximation, the method allows to determine with\nbetter accuracy its depth, as well as to separate the effects of the eclipse\nand out-of-eclipse parts. For multi-color observations, improving the accuracy\nof the smoothing of the curve in each filter will allow to obtain with better\naccuracy the curves of the color index variations.

It is shown, that fake QE-like\nevents lead to significant distortions in neutrino energy reconstruction.\nFlux-folded and unfolded cross sections for QE-like scattering are calculated\nas functions of both true and reconstructed energies.

The\nplanet light-curve is reanalysed using long and short cadence Kepler\nobservations from the first 14 quarters. Orbital period of the planet was\nimproved. We prove that the peculiar light-curve of this objects is in\nagreement with the idea of a planet with a comet like tail. There is an\nevidence of a quasi periodic long term evolution of the tail. Light-curve has a\nprominent pre-transit brightening and a less prominent post-transit\nbrightening. Both are caused by the forward scattering and are a strong\nfunction of the particle size. This feature enabled us to estimate a typical\nparticle size (radius) in the dust tail of about 0.1-1 micron. However, there\nis an indication that the particle size changes along the tail. Larger\nparticles better reproduce the pre-transit brightening and transit core while\nsmaller particles are more compatible with the egress and post-transit\nbrightening. Dust density in the tail is a steep decreasing function of the\ndistance from the planet which indicates a significant tail destruction caused\nby the star.

The simulations follow the non-equilibrium chemistry/cooling\nof primordial gas and the conversion of the gas into metal-free stars. To\nquantify the radiative feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars emit\nboth molecular hydrogen dissociating and hydrogen/helium ionizing radiation\nwith a simulation in which stars emit only dissociating radiation, and with a\nsimulation in which stars remain dark. Photodissociation and -ionization exert\na strong negative feedback on the assembly of the simulated galaxy. Gas\ncondensation is strongly impeded, and star formation is strongly suppressed in\ncomparison with the simulation in which stars remain dark. The feedback on the\ngas implies a suppression of the central dark matter densities in the minihalo\nprogenitor by factors of up to a few, which is a significant deviation from the\nsingular isothermal density profile characterizing the dark matter distribution\nin the absence of radiative feedback. The evolution of gas densities, star\nformation rates, and the distribution of dark matter becomes insensitive to the\ninclusion of dissociating radiation in the late stages of the minihalo\nassembly, and it becomes insensitive to the inclusion of ionizing radiation\nonce the minihalo turns into an atomically cooling galaxy.

The resulting flow\nis of von K\\'arm\\'an type, consisting of a layer of zonal velocity close to the\nouter wall and a secondary meridional circulation. Above a certain forcing\nthreshold, the mean flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric motions within an\nequatorial belt. For fixed forcing above this threshold, we have studied the\ndynamo properties of this flow. The presence of a conducting outer wall is\nessential to the existence of a dynamo at these parameters. We have therefore\nstudied the effect of changing the material parameters of the wall (magnetic\npermeability, electrical conductivity, and thickness) on the dynamo. In common\nwith previous studies, we find that dynamos are obtained only when either the\nconductivity or the permeability is sufficiently large. However, we find that\nthe effect of these two parameters on the dynamo process are different and can\neven compete to the detriment of the dynamo. Our self-consistent approach allow\nus to analyze in detail the dynamo feedback loop. The dynamos we obtain are\ntypically dominated by an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field and an axial\ndipole component. We show that the ability of the outer shear layer to produce\na strong toroidal field depends critically on the presence of a conducting\nouter wall, which shields the fluid from the vacuum outside.

Previous efforts to\ndevelop ion force fields have generally focused on reproducing experimental\nmeasurements of aqueous solution properties such as hydration free energies and\nion-water distribution functions. This dependency limits transferability of the\nresulting parameters because of the variety and known limitations of water\nmodels. We present a solvent-independent approach to calibrating ion parameters\nbased exclusively on crystal lattice properties. Our procedure relies on\nminimization of lattice sums to calculate lattice energies and interionic\ndistances instead of equilibrium ensemble simulations of dense fluids. The gain\nin computational efficiency enables simultaneous optimization of all parameters\nfor Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, F-, Cl-, Br-, and I- subject to constraints that\nenforce consistency with periodic table trends. We demonstrate the method by\npresenting lattice-derived parameters for the primitive model and the\nLennard-Jones model with Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules. The resulting\nparameters successfully reproduce the lattice properties used to derive them\nand are free from the influence of any water model. To assess the\ntransferability of the Lennard-Jones parameters to aqueous systems, we used\nthem to estimate hydration free energies and found that the results were in\nquantitative agreement with experimentally measured values. These\nlattice-derived parameters are applicable in simulations where coupling of ion\nparameters to a particular solvent model is undesirable.

In this study, we take into account dark matter\nparticles, assumed to behave like fermions with a free parameter to account for\nthe interaction strength among the particles, as a possible constituent of\nneutron stars. We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of\nstate more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass\nof the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the\nparticle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2\ntimes solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such\nkind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement\nof the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a\nneutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when\nhyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner\ntheory. Furthermore, in this particular case, we point out that the dark matter\naround a neutron star should also contribute to the mass measurement due to its\npure gravitational effect. However, our numerically calculation illustrates\nthat such contribution could be safely ignored because of the usual diluted\ndark matter environment assumed. We conclude that a very high mass measurement\nof about 2 times solar mass requires a really stiff equation of state in\nneutron stars, and find a strong upper limit (<= 0.64 GeV) for the particle\nmass of non-self- annihilating dark matter based on the present model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2012 02:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-21"}

The construction of\nthese circuits determines both the latency and the anonymity degree of the Tor\nanonymity system.

A major difference, however, is the high velocity resolution of the\nVLA-ANGST observations (0.65 and 1.3km/s for the majority of the galaxies). The\nVLA-ANGST data products are made publicly available at:\nhttps://science.nrao.edu/science/surveys/vla-angst. With available star\nformation histories from resolved stellar populations and lower resolution\nancillary observations from the FIR to the UV, VLA-ANGST will enable detailed\nstudies of the relationship between the ISM and star formation in dwarf\ngalaxies on a ~100 pc scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Aug 2012 10:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

As simple counterexamples show this is not true in general,\nbut we present a simple necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the\nnon-existence of a neutral region.

I calculated the\nproduction rate of lithium and came to the conclusion that, for pressures of\ntwo bars or greater, are produced between 21 and 81 lithium nuclei for each\nprimary cosmic rays proton. For lower pressures, the production is less and\nalmost nil with the current pressure of Mars or Earth (pressure of CO2).\nAssuming a rate of cosmic ray arrival at Mars equal to that of Earth, and a\npressure greater than two bars throughout the history of Mars, the amount of\nlithium that would occur would be between 162 and 642 million metric tons (in\nthe Earth lithium estimated reserves are 30 million metric tons). These values\nare an upper limit; the actual amount of lithium on Mars will depend on the\ntime in which the planet had a dense atmosphere (> 2 bars). That is, the amount\nof lithium produced by cosmic rays, serves to estimate the time that Mars had a\nthick atmosphere and therefore the capacity for have liquid water on surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 19:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-03"}
